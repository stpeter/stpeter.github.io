<h2>Freedom East, Freedom West</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>

<h3>2007-07-14</h3>
<p>Longtime readers of this blog know that politically I lean libertarian (outside North America that's called "liberal"), and that I was quite interested in the <a href="https://www.fsp.org/">Free State Project</a> in its run-up to choosing a state where a number of libertarians might relocate. That state turned out to be New Hampshire. But naturally lots of folks out west didn't want to move east of the Mississippi, leading to continued interest in state #2: Wyoming. Thus the <a href="http://www.freestatewyoming.org/">Free State Wyoming</a> project. I don't follow either project closely, but I get the sense that there's some bad blood between them. To my mind that's just silly, but schisms and purer-than-thou splinter groups are always de rigeur in small ideological movements. In any case, both groups recently held summertime get-togethers, and the press coverage makes for interesting reading.</p>
