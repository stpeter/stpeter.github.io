<h2>Providing an Alternative</h2>
<h3>2017-08-16</h3>
<p>Although I pay no attention to the news, I'm vaguely aware that perhaps the world is becoming more negative and irrational. Rather than getting lost in despair and confusion, I try to model a positive, reasonable alternative by living the best life I can and by writing philosophical books that are clear, concise, and constructive. I've written six such books, with a seventh half done and an eighth outlined. Even though each of these books takes 500-1000 hours to research and write, I make them all available for free on my website (however, I do charge for the paperback and ebook versions). To date I've also made no effort to market them, so I depend on word of mouth. If you have found value in any of these books, I'd greatly appreciate it if you could tell a friend, write a review at Amazon, or give a copy as a gift. Thanks. :-)</p>
