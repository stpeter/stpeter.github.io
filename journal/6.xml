<p>Some more thoughts on Objectivist aesthetics: Objectivism holds that there is <em>something</em> in reality to which the concept 'art' applies. This means that all the art-forms hold something in common, that there is a conceptual unity to the arts. I think that a resultant belief in the unity of the arts has important consequences for artistic production. The original Romantics were innovators in that they considered art to be a unity. The Romantics cultivated connections among the arts (Beethoven writing overtures to plays; Hugo writing in all the literary forms, and painting as well; Schubert and others setting great poems to music, and so on). Could it be that an Objectivist movement in the arts would have the same results? It seems to me that a focus on the unity of the arts might be an important aspect of future art created by Objectivists.</p>
