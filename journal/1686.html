<h2>Weekly Wisdom</h2>

<h3>2021-12-27</h3>
<p>Although I don't make New Year's resolutions, at this time of year I do tend to reconsider some of my goals and practices. One thing I'd like to improve on is the frequency of entries in my online journal, because writing them pushes me to think about how I'm living and what I'm learning. Thus going forward I'll strive to post such reflections at least once a week - most likely on Friday evenings or over the weekend, when it's easier to find time for reflection.
