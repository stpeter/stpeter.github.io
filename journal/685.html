<h2>Didja Know?</h2>
<h3>2005-03-13</h3>
    <p>Here are some other things I learned by surfing around the other night:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The continuing advance of materials science makes it possible to build <a href="http://www.samizdata.net/blog/archives/007315.html#007315">really cool bridges</a>.</li>
      <li>There is a long <a href="http://www.qserve.net/~allsouls/ser011007.htm">tradition of Unitarianism</a> in the mountains of Transylvania (thanks to <a href="http://kenmacleod.blogspot.com/2005_02_01_kenmacleod_archive.html#110958987062164753">Ken MacLeod</a>).</li>
      <li>The Whole Foods chain of organic grocery stores is <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/84/wholefoods.html">run by an anarchist</a> who has <a href="http://www.freedomfest.com/success.html">some good advice</a> for libertarians. (The concept of an anarchist running an organization may seem paradoxical, but it's a paradox I experience daily if on a smaller scale at the <a href="https://www.jabber.org/jsf/">JSF</a>; recently I ran across the word "anarchitect", which feels like an appropriate term for someone who works hard to foster spontaneous orders.)</li>
      <li>There are lots of <a href="http://blogsbyiranians.com/">Iranian blogs</a>, which is not insignificant since Iran is a place where <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3764582.stm">bloggers are arbitrarily arrested</a>. Even a cursory reading of these blogs indicates that Iran is seething (not least perhaps for demographic reasons -- there are lots of young people in Iran who were born after the Revolution there and want a more open society). Watch <a href="http://www.activistchat.com/blogiran/">Blog-Iran</a> and <a href="http://www.daneshjoo.org/">SMCCDI</a> for the latest news.</li>
    </ul>
