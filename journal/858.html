<h2>Startup U?</h2>

<h3>2006-01-26</h3>
    <p>A while back, one of the local public access channels I watch from time to time aired a mini-debate on privatizing the public universities in Colorado. Amusingly, only the moderator had anything good to say about the idea. Some debate.</p>
    <p>Long-time readers of this blog will not be surprised to hear that I thought the proposal did not go far enough. To me, the sad thing about higher education is that it's dominated by large, state run institutions. Imagine if the same were true in the rest of the economy: we'd all be working for government monopolies or public utilities such as the old AT&amp;T, your local electric company, and the like. Thankfully, we don't -- and the result is a tremendously flexible economy, a churning mass of small companies, new startups forming every minute, and ever-increasing innovation.</p>
    <p>Yet we have very little of this in higher education. Sure, there's the University of Phoenix, College America, and such. But the phrase "educational entrepreneurship" still seems oxymoronic. Where are the small, innovative schools? Indeed, what would such schools even look like? Let's imagine for a minute...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They would be small, starting with just a handful of teachers and maybe several dozen customers, er, students.</li>
      <li>They would offer degrees in a small number of disciplines, focusing on economics or the biological sciences or law or physics and chemistry or the arts, not all of the above.</li>
      <li>They would innovate -- lots of hands-on learning, internships, practicums, guest lecturers, peer learning, blogging, debate, etc. Think flat organization, not the traditional hierarchy.</li>
      <li>Teachers would set their own prices. Out with tenure, in with the market.</li>
      <li>They would be intimately connected to the local economy -- drama schools near theatre districts, computing schools near industrial parks, law schools near courts and legislatures, art schools near galleries.</li>
      <li>They wouldn't have expensive sports teams, food service, dorms, fancy buildings, or lots of extracurricular activities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are such schools, especially in the arts. But we don't have nearly enough of them.</p>
