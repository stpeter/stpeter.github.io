<h2>Polis Envy</h2>

    <p>My old teacher <a href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/larmore/">Charles Larmore</a> used to say that those who look back to ancient Athens as the model for modern communitarianism were engaging in "polis envy"; Roderick Long does one better by arguing persuasively as follows:</p> 
    <blockquote>
      <p>Contrary to the claims of so many historians, ancient Athens was neither a majoritarian, mob-rule democracy nor an organic, communitarian collective; instead, it was in many respects a quasi-anarchistic free-market constitutional republic -- and thus, like medieval Iceland, a valuable model for our libertarian future.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>His essays <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/long/long8.html">The Athenian Constitution: Government by Jury and Referendum</a> and <a href="http://lewrockwell.com/long/long9.html">Civil Society in Ancient Greece: The Case of Athens</a> appear to be well worth reading if you have the time (which I don't -- I've only skimmed them).</p>
