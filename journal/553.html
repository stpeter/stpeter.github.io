<h2>Reading at Risk</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>

<h3>2004-07-12</h3>
    <p>The (U.S.) National Endowment for the Arts has released a <a href="http://www.nea.gov/pub/ReadingAtRisk.pdf">study</a> of reading habits in America, and has concluded that Americans read a lot fewer novels, short stories, plays, and poems than they used to. Given the relatively narrow focus of the study, I suppose I fit the trend. Although I am re-reading the complete poetry of Walt Whitman these days, I mostly focus on history and philosophy rather than literature. Right now I'm reading <a href="http://isbn.nu/0060197897">Freedom Just Around the Corner</a> (the first volume of a new history of America, in which author <a href="http://www.history.upenn.edu/faculty/mcdougall.htm">Walter McDougall</a> argues that America is a nation of hustlers -- in both the good and bad senses of the word). I'm also working my way through the <a href="http://isbn.nu/069101650X">Complete Works of Aristotle</a> -- so far I've finished all of the biological and psychological works except for <cite>De Anima</cite>. Expect a full report on these books soon...</p>
