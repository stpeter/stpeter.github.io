<h2>More on Ancient Friends</h2>

<p>A mere two nights after quoting Niccolò Machiavelli's reflections on his ancient friends, I came upon a similar passage in <cite>Essays in Idleness</cite>, written by the Japanese poet-monk Yoshida Kenkō around the year 1330. Here's what Kenkō had to say, in the translation by Donald Keene:</p>
<blockquote>
The pleasantest of all diversions is to sit alone under the lamp, a book spread out before you, and to make friends with people of a distant past you have never known. The books I would choose are the moving volumes of <cite>Wen Hsüan</cite>, the collected works of Po Chü-i, the sayings of Lao Tzu, and the chapters of Chuang Tzu.
</blockquote>
<p>Whereas Machiavelli conversed with ancient Greek and Roman historians like Polybius and Livy, Kenkō befriended Chinese poets and Taoist philosophers. Much as I enjoy history, I give the nod to Kenkō because his preferences align more closely with mine. As Aristotle said in Chapter IX of the <cite>Poetics</cite>: "Poetry is a more philosophical and a higher thing than history: for poetry tends to express the universal, history the particular."</p>
