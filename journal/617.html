    <p>Following a <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2004/11/10#stochasticAttitudeTest">link</a> from Doc Searls, I found this <a href="http://members.shaw.ca/delajara/GREIQ.html">GRE to IQ converter</a>, which says I have an IQ of 157 or 161, depending on how many points per standard deviation the IQ test uses. (It doesn't take into account one's score on the Analytical test, on which I didn't do quite as well as Verbal and Quantitative, though I took the GRE on a lark and didn't study or prepare, so who knows.) The main question is: does it really matter? I've known plenty of smart people who were jerks, bastards, and sonofabitches (not to mention uncreative, impractical, or just plain lazy), so I tend to downplay the importance of raw smarts in life.</p>
