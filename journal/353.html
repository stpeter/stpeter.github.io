<h2>Goodbye, Monadnock</h2>
<h3>2003-03-23</h3>
<p>In 1997 I started publishing a literary webzine entitled the <a href="http://review.monadnock.net/">Monadnock Review</a>. Over the years I used it as a forum for my <a href="/writings/fire/">poems</a> and some of my <a href="/writings/rand/">essays</a>, and as way to find and publish works by like-minded writers. Unfortunately, I haven't put much time into it for the last few years and I can't get myself excited about re-invigorating the site, so I've decided to pull the plug. I'm now busily moving my writings from monadnock.net to saint-andre.com, in anticipation of selling off the former domain. Someone in southeastern New Hampshire has got to be interested in it...</p>
