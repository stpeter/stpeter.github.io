<h2>Grain-Free Granola Recipe</h2>

<p>Although I don't live or eat in a consistently paleo fashion, I do like some paleo foods. One of my favorites is grain-free granola. It also happens to be very simple to make. Here's how.</p>
<p>While you preheat the oven to 275ËšF, measure 2 cups of almonds into a large food processor bowl and pulse 6 to 8 times. Add 2 cups of cashews, 1 cup of dried, unsweetened coconut threads, half a cup of pumpkin seeds, half a cup of sunflower seeds, then pulse again a few times.</p>
<p>Combine half a cup of coconut oil, a third of a cup of honey, and a teaspoon of vanilla paste in a large bowl, then microwave it until the oil turns to liquid (about a minute). Add the nut/seed mixture to the bowl and mix thoroughly with a spoon.</p>
<p>Place the mixture on a non-stick baking sheet, placing parchment paper underneath if your baking sheet is not truly non-stick. Spread the mixture evenly and cook for 25 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and mix in 1 cup of dried fruit (I like cranberries). Spread it evenly again and sprinkle with 3-4 pinches of sea salt. Let it cool for 20 minutes and enjoy!</p>
<p>(But I do wonder: can we call it granola if it doesn't have any grain in it? ;-)</p>
