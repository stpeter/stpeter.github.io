<h2>Planning to Be Old</h2>

<p>Earlier this year at a family gathering, I overheard an uncle of mine (who is in his late 80s) say something in passing to one of his siblings about the importance of planning to be old. This set me to thinking: what might such planning involve? Here are some possible considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saving and investing well so that you can remain financially solvent late in life</li>
<li>Staying physically active so that you can manage everyday tasks as long as possible</li>
<li>Staying mentally active so that you are sharp enough to handle things like financial decisions as you get older</li>
<li>Staying socially active to ensure your emotional health</li>
<li>Accepting the various pains and annoyances of old age without complaint</li>
<li>Learning to be alone, since if you live long enough you will lose some of the people who are dear to you</li>
<li>Giving back by volunteering in your community</li>
<li>Seeking truth and meaning by continuing to acquire wisdom as long as you live</li>
<li>Sharing some of the wisdom you have gained through mentoring, teaching, or creative pursuits</li>
<li>Leaving a legacy by selecting worthy causes to which you can donate time or money</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these activities require foresight, common sense, and practical wisdom, which too often are lacking in our youth-obsessed, live-for-the-day society. But they are far from impossible to cultivate, so it's best to start now...</p>
