<h2>The Sleeping Giant</h2>
<h3>2006-07-30</h3>
    <p>I just finished reading Bruce Bawer's book <a href="http://isbn.nu/0385514727">While Europe Slept: How Radical Islam Is Destroying The West From Within</a>. I am given given neither to schadenfreude over the problems of various European countries nor to the view that they are experiencing a crisis of world-historical proportions. Yet one who values the Western values of free minds and free markets cannot help but be disturbed by the prospect of the heart of Western civilization bowing down meekly before militant Islamic fundamentalism, accepting sharia, and becoming a Balkanized kind of Eurabia. Many observers call this threat <a href="http://www.austinbay.net/blog/index.php?p=1327">Islamo-fascism</a>, which I think is not really accurate since fascism was <a href="/writings/ismbook/fascism.html">a form of nationalism</a>. The term <a href="http://www.transterrestrial.com/archives/007449.html#007449">jihadism</a> seems closer to the truth, in part because the jihadists have nothing positive whatsoever to offer and seek only to destroy the West. I don't have enough first-hand knowledge to say whether some or all European nations will submit to jihadism in the way that Bawer outlines. But I do know that it will never happen in America.</p>
