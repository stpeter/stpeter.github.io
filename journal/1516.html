<h2>Why I Am Not a Writer</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>

<h3>2014-10-02</h3>
<p>For several years, my Twitter profile has identified me thus: "Technologist. Writer. Musician." Yet I've come to realize that I'm not a writer. Oh, I do write on occasion and I'm fairly good at it, but I don't write every day or even every week like real writers do.</p>
<p>Although I've become less comfortable with self-identifying as a writer, I've become more comfortable with self-identifying as a philosopher (in the sense of <a href="1432.html">a seeker after wisdom</a>). Thinking and reflecting on my experience is something that I do every day, even if it sometimes takes years for those insights to appear in writing. So now it's: "Technologist. Musician. Philosopher."</p>
