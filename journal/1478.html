<h2>The Poets of Epicurus, V: Swinburne</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>
</h3>
<h3>2012-12-20</h3>
<p>On June 9, 1889, a group of Italian freethinkers dedicated a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Giordano_Bruno">statue of Giordano Bruno</a> on the very spot in Rome where he had been burned at the stake in 1600 for his heretical views (which, as I <a href="1477.html">explained yesterday</a>, were substantially Epicurean). To mark the occasion, the English poet and secularist Charles Algernon Swinburne wrote a fine poem entitled <a href="http://monadnock.net/swinburne/monument.html">The Monument of Giordano Bruno</a>, which I recently republished at the <a href="http://monadnock.net/">Monadnock Press</a>. Swinburne also wrote a poem entitled <a href="http://monadnock.net/swinburne/feast.html">For the Feast of Giordano Bruno, Philosopher and Martyr</a>. In it, Swinburne links the freethinker Bruno to Lucretius and thereby implicitly to Epicurus:</p>
<blockquote>
Lift up thy light on us and on thine own,<br>
O soul whose spirit on earth was as a rod<br>
To scourge off priests, a sword to pierce their God,<br>
A staff for man's free thought to walk alone,<br>
A lamp to lead him far from shrine and throne<br>
On ways untrodden where his fathers trod<br>
Ere earth's heart withered at a high priest's nod<br>
And all men's mouths that made not prayer made moan.<br>
From bonds and torments and the ravening flame<br>
Surely thy spirit of sense rose up to greet<br>
Lucretius, where such only spirits meet,<br>
And walk with him apart till Shelley came<br>
To make the heaven of heavens more heavenly sweet<br>
And mix with yours a third incorporate name.
</blockquote>
<p>(Note that Swinburne also lauds Percy Bysshe Shelley as among the same illustrious company as Lucretius and Bruno; I have yet to read much of Shelley's work but he might appear in a future installment of "The Poets of Epicurus".)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my copy of the complete poems of Swinburne is packed away right now. I'll make sure to dig it out soon and report further if I find more traces of Epicurus in Swinburne's work.</p>
