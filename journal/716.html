<h2>Juvenilia</h2>
<h3>2005-04-16</h3>
    <p>While cleaning out some old file folders last night, I found some early writings of mine. They're not really very good, but I've typed them into my computer and put them online anyway. I had not written much by that time in my life, and it shows. At least I've gotten to be a better writer through years of practice -- or so I hope!</p>
    <p>The pieces are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A <a href="2.html">journal entry</a> from 1992 that seems to have been an attempt to summarize my philosophy of life at that time. Things have changed since then.</li>
      <li>An essay entitled <a href="/writings/essays/sacred.html">Secular vs. Sacred: The Modern Dilemma</a>, which won honorable mention in an essay contest run by The Humanist magazine in 1992. Similar in many ways to my <a href="715.html">blog entry</a> from the other day on spirituality.</li>
      <li>A very early essay entitled <a href="/writings/essays/maine.html">What I Love About Maine</a>, which I wrote for my freshman English class at Columbia University. I was painfully afraid of writing back then and my teacher Victoria Redel helped me through that, for which I'm forever in her debt.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Not great writing, and best filed under the heading of juvenilia. But perhaps someone will find them interesting. :-)</p>
