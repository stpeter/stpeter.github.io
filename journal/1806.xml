<header><title>Tao Te Ching ยง11: Emptiness</title><date>2023-08-03</date></header>
<entry>
<p>Following up on yesterday's post about the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite>, here's another poem that I might set to music (chapter 11 in the standard order). My provisional rendering is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
Some thirty spokes meet in one hub<br/>
Through emptiness it does its work<br/>
Throw clay and shape it to a jar<br/>
Through emptiness it does its work<br/>
Cut doors and windows, make a room<br/>
Through emptiness it does its work
<br/><br/>
The craftsman profits from its mass<br/>
And yet it works through emptiness
</blockquote>
<p>At only 8 lines, it would make for an extremely short song. But that might be the nature of this project!</p>
<p>In this poem we glimpse the paradoxical side of Taoism. To my mind it suggests an aesthetic appreciation for subtlety, silence, simplicity, austere beauty, and what must be left unsaid - the space between the notes, if you will. Indeed, this poem raises the possibility that the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite> itself might do its work through emptiness, for if the philosophical is the personal then (as chapter 1 puts it) "the way that we can say is not the ageless Way" and "the name that we can name is not the ageless Name".</p>
<p>But how could this be? Isn't the ageless something abstract and far away? Perhaps; but perhaps instead it's something tangible and near: the abiding ways of living that human beings have engaged in for as long as we have been on this beautiful earth of ours.</p>
