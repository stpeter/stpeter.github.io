<h2>MAD Again?</h2>

<h3>2003-04-06</h3>
<p>Thank to <a href="http://www.netmeme.org/blog/">Bryan Field-Elliott</a>, I just found this <a href="http://www.interesting-people.org/archives/interesting-people/200302/msg00186.html">fascinating essay</a> by John Perry Barlow about the possibility that there is a method to the seeming madness of American foreign policy. In essence Barlow argues that maybe, just maybe the point of the current war is to convince the rest of the world (or at least all the world's thugs) that America is dangerous enough that its wrath must be scrupulously avoided. The result would be a Pax Americana that makes the world safe for global capitalism. I'm not saying that's a good thing, but perhaps it's just crazy enough to be true.</p>
