<h2>London Calling</h2>

<h3>2003-08-27</h3>
<p>Today I received an email from Chris Tame of the <a href="http://www.libertarian.co.uk/">Libertarian Alliance</a>, a leading British libertarian organization based in London. It seems that they'd like to republish some of my essays, which I'll gladly oblige them since I have great respect for their organization and their high-quality publication series. So now I'm reviewing and (where necessary) editing the essays they've requested. It's been years since I've read some of them, so it's quite possible my perspectives have changed over time -- after all, I never promised to agree with what I've written in the past. :-)</p>
