<h2>Impasses</h2>
<h3>2018-10-30</h3>
<p>Impasses along the path toward the goals of life can occur in three dimensions:</p>
<ol>
<li>From beginning to end: immaturity, getting stuck on earlier phases of life, inability to let go of upbringing issues, unrealistic / fantastical goals for the future, living too much in the past or the future, inability to translate goals into specific plans and practices.</li>
<li>From below to above: materialism, consumerism, hedonism, over focus on preconditions for eudaimonia like health and wealth, guilt over natural needs and drives, (less commonly) otherworldliness.</li>
<li>From without to within: envy and anger and resentment, over concern with how others perceive you (reputation, desire for fame), over acceptance of external standards, submerging your identity in a movement or ideology, self-absorption, lack of friendships, inability to form healthy relationships, lack of self-knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<p>Along all three dimensions a healthy balance is needed and enables a truly human kind of flourishing.</p>
