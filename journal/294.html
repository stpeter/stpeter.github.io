<h3>2002-10-03</h3>
<p>Last week's words were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>autarky -- economic self-sufficiency, usually as applied to nations (not to be confused with autarchy = absolute power)</li>
<li>praxeology -- the study of human action</li>
<li>syndicalism -- worker ownership of the means of production, especially through the mediation of trade unions</li>
<li>fungible -- the quality of being replaceable by like goods (e.g., bushels of wheat are fungible, since one is as good as another)</li>
<li>monopsony -- the situation in which there is only one buyer for a good or service</li>
</ul>
