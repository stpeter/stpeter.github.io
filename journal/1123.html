<h2>Tough Questions</h2>
<h3>2007-07-31</h3>
<p>Anti-Americanism is a fascinating psychological phenomenon. Case in point: American exchange students in Germany who are <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,496731,00.html">regularly subjected</a> to a high-handed barrage of questions about the evils of American society from their host students. There are so many factors at play here: the immaturity of most students, the essential collectivism involved in stereotyping foreigners, envy of American success, and much else besides. Personally I'd turn the tables by asking some questions of my own:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since Job satisfaction is highly correlated with emotional well-being, I wonder: what is the unemployment rate in your country? (America: 4.5%; Germany: 9%)</li>
<li>How successful has your country been in accepting and assimilating immigrants? (According to <a href="http://www.migrationinformation.org/">migrationinformation.org</a>, 12% of Americans and 9% of Germans were born in other countries, but that doesn't tell the  integration story; I don't get the sense that all those Turks, Yugoslavians, Italians, Greeks, and Poles -- and their children -- are considered to be German in the way that immigrants to the States are considered to be American.)</li>
<li>For how long has your country had a continuously democratic form of government? (America: 388 years since the Virginia House of Burgesses was founded in 1619; for western Germany 58 years since the first free elections after WWII in August 1949, for eastern Germany 17 years since reunification after the fall of the Berlin Wall.)</li>
<li>Which of the world's ten most populous nations would you rather live in: China, India, America, Indonesia, Brazil, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Russia, Nigeria, or Japan?</li>
<li>Throughout history, how many people have voted with their feet by leaving America to settle in your country and by leaving your country to settle in America? (7.2 million people have left Germany for America since 1820, and in fact more Americans trace their ancestry to Germany than any other nation; I have not been able to find historical statistics on the number of Americans who have settled in Germany.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't get me wrong. I think Germany is a fine country. I wish I had kept up my early studies of the German language so that I could read more materials in German as opposed to English translation. Underneath all the wrangling of present-day politics I think there is a fundamental affinity between America and Germany (after all, American civilization is downstream from England, and who are the English but a bunch of displaced Germans?). I like just about every German person I've ever gotten to know. I appreciate the frank, even brutal honesty of many German people. But I also wish that they would turn that honesty more often on their own society and focus on improving their own country rather than seeking a scapegoat in the USA.</p>
<p>And anti-Americanism is by no means limited to Germany; we could ask even more pointed questions about, say, some places in the Muslim world (e.g., 70 percent of people in the Palestinian territories think that suicide bombings are often or sometimes justified -- talk about a culture of death!).</p>
<p>Finally, I think the lasting answer is individualism: not stereotyping people from any given country or expecting any given individual to agree with or justify the actions of those in power, but engaging in honest and open dialogue with each person you talk with to understand their personal perspective. It's not easy, but it's the only approach that does justice to the fact that every person is unique. "Repeat after me: I am an individual." :-)</p>
