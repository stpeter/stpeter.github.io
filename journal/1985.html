<h2>Historical Aspirations</h2>

<p>Following up on my post about thinking historically, here are some further reflections on the methodological insights (and, to my mind, shortcomings) of my favorite historian, David Hackett Fischer.</p>
<p>As noted last time, Fischer is an empiricist who is quite leery of philosophizing, moralizing, essentialism, metahistory, the drive for certainty, the holist desire for completeness, attempts at explaining <em>why</em> things happened the way they did, and so on; he is much more comfortable describing a few of the "infinite number" of "factual patterns" that can be "superimposed upon past events" (Fischer 1970, p. 70). He goes on to say: "A historian's task is to find patterns which are more relevant to his problems, and more accurate and more comprehensive than others, but he cannot hope to find that 'essential' pattern..." (ibid.).</p>
<p>I sense a few difficulties here. First, I'm skeptical that there is literally an <em>infinite</em> number of patterns to be found in the facts of the past; instead, it seems to me that at any one time there are only a few patterns under serious consideration to explain a given historical phenomenon (say, the American Revolution or, more concretely, the development among the colonists of a self-perception that they were "Americans"). Second, Fischer's criterion of comprehensiveness sounds rather similar to the habit of holism that he has criticized in others as a fallacy. Third, Fischer's criterion of accuracy sounds rather similar to doing justice to the reality ("essential" or otherwise) of past events.</p>
<p>Indeed, slightly later in his book <cite>Historians' Fallacies</cite>, Fischer defines history as "an empirical search for external truths, and for the best, most complete, and most profound external truths, in a maximal corresponding relationship with the absolute reality of past events" (Fischer 1970, p. 87).</p>
<p>As I see it, accuracy, completeness, and profundity are aspirational ideals for the working historian (including the historian of ideas, which to some extent I try to be in my books on philosophers like Nietzsche, Epicurus, and Thoreau). Every researcher who is at all realistic knows that no one work can explain past events in a way that is entirely accurate, fully complete, and profoundly meaningful - yet, even so, we can try our best to achieve those ideals in our historical investigations.</p>
