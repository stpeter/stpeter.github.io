<h2>More Justice</h2>
<h3>2005-04-04</h3>
    <p>Last month I <a href="700.html">wrote the mayor</a> of Denver challenging him to seek alternatives to incarceration for non-violent offenders such as prostitutes and drug users (most of whom probably need counseling and social assistance a lot more than they need time in the country jail). It turns out that the mayor had already formed an <a href="http://www.denvergov.com/Boards_and_Commissions/template24335.asp">Alternatives to Sentencing Committee</a> recently, but I had not heard about it. Let's hope the committee does good work.</p>
