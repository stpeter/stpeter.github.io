<h2>For the Common Defense</h2>

<p>Over at <a href="http://washparkprophet.blogspot.com/">Wash Park Prophet</a> (and as I discovered via <a href="http://planetcolorado.org/">Planet Colorado</a>), Andrew Oh-Willeke <a href="http://washparkprophet.blogspot.com/2008/03/defense-as-foreign-aid.html">asks</a>: how much of the budget of the U.S. Defense Department is truly devoted to defense of the American homeland, and how much is something else?</p>
<p>Andrew estimates that true defense would cost about $60-$80 billion a year (20% of the current budget). I don't have any special reason to dispute his figures, though I'd like to do some more research on the matter sometime. And although I think that the premium above that 20% is mostly a form of subsidy, I'm not quite sure I would chalk it up to foreign aid (some of it might be a form of subsidy to American corporations who trade overseas). I don't think that such a smaller military would be without costs of its own or that it would cause an outbreak of global harmony, but I do think it's worth contemplating what America and the world might look like under such a regime.</p>
