<p>Every once in a while I post a recipe here, almost as much for my own reference as for sharing. Because several people have asked me about my whole wheat pancakes recently, I figured I'd write up how I make them.</p>
<p>There are two sets of ingredients, five wet and five dry:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zest of one orange</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>6 tablespoons canola oil</li>
<li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
<li>¼ cup heavy cream</li>
<li>2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
<li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
<li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>(optional but recommended) 1 cup wild blueberries</li>
</ul>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk all the dry ingredients. In a smaller mixing bowl, whisk all the wet ingredients. Whisk the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until just mixed and no dry spots remain. Optionally, add the blueberries. Spoon out ¼ cup of batter at a time onto a warm pan or griddle, flip when bubbles start to appear, and serve with maple syrup or your favorite sweetener (orange marmalade is a great choice). Makes 16-18 pancakes.</p>
<p>I use heavy cream because I prefer thick pancakes - substitute with milk if you prefer them thinner. And for a delightfully nutty flavor, use walnut oil instead of canola oil.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
