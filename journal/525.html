    <p>The constitution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics included the same protections as the constitution of the United States of America (that's plural, thank you very much). The only difference: the Soviet constitution was the political equivalent of toilet paper. There used to be a joke about the Former Soviet Union that they had freedom of speech, too -- they just didn't have freedom <em>after</em> speech. The scary thing is that we're approaching that state in America now. Here is <a href="http://www.news-journalonline.com/newsjournalonline/opinion/editorials/03opopn62051504.htm">proof positive</a>. Read it and weep for America and what it once stood for, because those days are long gone and we are all <a href="http://kenmacleod.blogspot.com/2004_05_01_kenmacleod_archive.html#108349309892487667">part of the system</a> now. United Soviets of America?</p>
