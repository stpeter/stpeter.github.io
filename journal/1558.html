<h2>Chocolate Bark Recipe</h2>
<h3>2016-10-15</h3>
<p>Because I love dark chocolate and almonds, I decided to start making my own chocolate bark. Turns out it's very easy and also delicious. Here's how I do it.</p>
<p>There are only three ingredients: 1 lb dark chocolate (I buy 4 oz bars of 72% dark chocolate at the supermarket), 1 cup of whole raw almonds, and a few pinches of sea salt. (Although I prefer almonds, you can also use pumpkin seeds or cashews or anything else that suits your fancy.)</p>
<p>Step one is to temper the chocolate. Break three quarters of the chocolate (i.e., 3 of the 4 bars) into smaller pieces (e.g., eighths), place it in a large bowl, and microwave it in 60-second bursts on 50% power until it's mostly melted and reaches a temperature of 110-115˚F (44-46˚C), stirring after each round. I've found that this takes around 5½ minutes here at 6,200 ft above sea level. To be safe, on the later rounds cut the time to 30 seconds and keep checking the temperature so that you don't overheat it.</p>
<p>Now break the remaining one quarter of the chocolate into smaller pieces and add it to the bowl. Stir constantly until the new pieces melt in and the mixture reaches a temperature of 88-90˚F (32˚C).</p>
<p>Stir the almonds into the melted chocolate and pour the chocolate mixture onto a sheet of parchment paper in a baking sheet. Using a spatula, spread the mixture so that it is about a quarter inch thick. Then sprinkle the sea salt lightly over the mixture.</p>
<p>Allow to cool to room temperature and then transfer to the refrigerator. Break into pieces and store them in the fridge.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
