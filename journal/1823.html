<h2>Outline of Complete Thyself</h2>

<p>You might have noticed that the pace of blogging has slowed around here. There are two primary reasons for this state of affairs. One is that we recently got a golden retriever puppy named Chance and he's keeping us busy!</p>
<p><img src="/images/chance-1.jpg"></p>
<p>The other is that I've been working more seriously on my forthcoming book about Aristotle's conception of human fulfillment. Along with creating many book and article summaries, I've put together a rough outline. Although it's subject to significant revision as I continue my research, what follows is an accurate snapshot of my current thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 1: Fulfillment</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The four lives: making money, having fun, giving back, seeking truth.</li>
  <li>Why Aristotle skips over the life of making money.</li>
  <li>Having fun: satisfying the natural selfâ€™s unreflective and unlimited desires.</li>
  <li>Giving back: contributing to the shared goals and activities of community life.</li>
  <li>Seeking truth: adding to human knowledge and wisdom through inquiry and reflection.</li>
  <li>Fundamentally, living is activity (energeia).</li>
  <li>Types of aliveness and levels of flourishing in plants, animals, and human beings.</li>
  <li>The "difference of man" and the difference it makes.</li>
  <li>Core human capacities: concepts, language, values, intentionality, sociality, etc.</li>
  <li>Fulfillment is not a feeling of satisfaction but the activation and development of capacities.</li>
  <li>Maturation as a process of developing ever greater unity, integration, and coherence.</li>
  <li>The self as an achievement.</li>
  <li>Taking life seriously.</li>
  <li>The task of living a fully human life.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 2: Character</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Character is the most complete development of the capacities for action and emotion.</li>
  <li>Taking goodness seriously.</li>
  <li>Learning to be good, educating your desires.</li>
  <li>Building character as a process of internalization.</li>
  <li>Character applies to both feeling and doing.</li>
  <li>Virtues moderate both pleasure and pain.</li>
  <li>Balance, the mean, what's appropriate, what's beautifully right.</li>
  <li>Internal order and disorder; unity, integration, and coherence.</li>
  <li>How the virtues foster order in our emotional lives, esp. with respect to pleasures and pains.</li>
  <li>Excellence of character vs self-restraint and unrestraint.</li>
  <li>Virtues as acquired traits and consistent practices.</li>
  <li>Beyond virtue: virtuosity in living.</li>
  <li>Aristotle's lists of virtues.</li>
  <li>Justice as a unifying principle.</li>
  <li>Virtue subsumes and supersedes pleasure and pain.</li>
  <li>The limits of virtue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 3: Wisdom</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Wisdom as the most complete development of the capacity for making decisions.</li>

  <li>Action with and without deliberation.</li>
  <li>Beyond choice: commitment.</li>

  <li>Wisdom subsumes and supersedes virtue.</li>
</ul>

  <li>Love as the most complete development of the capacity for forming relationships.</li>
  <li>Taking relationships seriously.</li>
  <li>The importance of sociality in human life.</li>
  <li>The three forms of philia.</li>
  <li>The activity of loving is better than being loved.</li>
  <li>Marriage, family, friendship, brotherhood, community.</li>
  <li>Philia as a practice.</li>
  <li>Love subsumes and supersedes virtue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 5: Love of Wisdom</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Sagacity as the most complete development of the capacity for understanding.</li>
