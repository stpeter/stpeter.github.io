<p>Of late I've been working on the first serious contribution to my forthcoming book about Aristotle's conception of human fulfillment: a glossary of key terms. Those curious enough to peruse it will quickly discover that some of my renderings are rather non-standard. In my defense, usually these translations are rooted in ancient Greek etymology and usage or modern academic scholarship (e.g., both Aryeh Kosman and Myles Burnyeat recommended "understanding" instead of "knowledge" for <em>epistēmē</em>, as I recently noted); however, in a few instances I go farther out on a limb (e.g., "thriving" instead of "virtue" for <em>aretē</em> and, most centrally of all, "fulfillment" instead of "happiness" for <em>eudaimonia</em>). Although all of these renderings are subject to change, I'm quite satisfied with them so far (having pondered them for years) and in fact they provide a good indication of the interpretive direction I'm taking.</p>
