    <p>Continuing the <a href="754.html">13 theme</a>, here are my 13 favorite Bob Dylan songs in (I think) chronological order of recording:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
<a href="https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/he-was-friend-mine/">He Was a Friend of Mine</a>. Recorded in 1962 and first officially released on <cite>The Bootleg Series, Volumes I-III</cite> in 1991. A lonesome lament for a lost friend. Haunting.</li>
      <li>
<a href="https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/mama-you-been-my-mind/">Mama, You Been on My Mind</a>. Recorded in 1963 and also first officially released on <cite>The Bootleg Series, Volumes I-III</cite> in 1991. The lyrics are quite poetic and I absolutely love the way he rhymes "mirror" with "near" by pronouncing it "meer" -- "When you wake up in the mornin', baby, look inside your meer. You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near..."</li>
      <li>
<a href="https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/boots-spanish-leather/">Boots of Spanish Leather</a>. A sad song in a powerful yet understated kind of way. That last stanza cuts to the quick.</li>
      <li>
<a href="https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/it-aint-me-babe/">It Ain't Me, Babe</a>. Stickin' up for yourself, circa 1964.</li>
      <li>
<a href="https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/its-all-over-now-baby-blue/">It's All Over Now, Baby Blue</a>. From <cite>Bringing It All Back Home</cite> (1965). Moving on after a failed romance. "Strike another match, go start anew..."</li>
      <li>
<a href="https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/its-alright-ma-im-only-bleeding/">It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)</a>. Wow. One of the most intense songs I know. I play and sing this one once in a while and it takes over your body and mind. Also from <cite>Bringing It All Back Home</cite> (1965).</li>
      <li>
<a href="https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/rolling-stone/">Like a Rolling Stone</a>. Sure, it's ever-popular, but it's got such <em>kick</em>, right from jump street with that snare drum sounding like a pistol shot. Pow!</li>
      <li>
<a href="https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/if-you-gotta-go-go-now/">If You Gotta Go, Go Now (Or Else You Gotta Stay All Night)</a>. A rollicking, fun, wry tune, but sensitive too ("I am just a poor boy, baby, lookin' to connect.  But I certainly don't want you thinkin' that I ain't got any respect.") Also from <cite>The Bootleg Series, Volumes I-III</cite>.</li>
      <li>
<a href="https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/leopard-skin-pill-box-hat/">Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat</a>. From the 1966 album <cite>Blonde on Blonde</cite>, this song is just plain silly, which is why I like it so much. That last stanza is too funny.</li>
      <li>
<a href="https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/sad-eyed-lady-lowlands/">Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands</a>. A <em>long</em> song, but I like long songs. This one unfolds like a dirge and provides a fitting end to <cite>Blonde on Blonde</cite>.</li>
      <li>
<a href="https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/tangled-blue/">Tangled Up in Blue</a>. Sure, it's a sad tale of busted romance and busted lives, but it's got a positive core ("keep on keepin' on..."). I prefer the alternate version released on <cite>The Bootleg Series, Volumes I-III</cite> to the version they play on the radio (from 1975's <cite>Blood on the Tracks</cite>).</li>
      <li>
<a href="https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/if-you-see-her-say-hello/">If You See Her, Say Hello</a>. Another sad but gorgeous song, also from <cite>Blood on the Tracks</cite>.</li>
      <li>
<a href="https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/blind-willie-mctell/">Blind Willie McTell</a>. One of the most powerful blues songs I have ever heard. Sends shivers up my spine every time I hear or sing it. I often re-play it three or four times in a row. Recorded in 1983 but not released until <cite>The Bootleg Series, Volumes I-III</cite> (1991).</li>
