<h2>A Philosophy for Living on Earth</h2>
<h3>2007-10-29</h3>
<p>Over the last few weeks I have copy-edited (and in a few cases more radically modified) all the essays in my collection <a href="/writings/rand/">A Philosophy for Living on Earth: Essays on Ayn Rand and Objectivism</a>. I still need to complete the essay on Aristotle and Rand, then I will be finished with this book. Perhaps I'll even self-publish it on (gasp!) paper in a few years' time. In the meantime it's all available for free on the 'net. Comments are welcome as always. :)</p>
