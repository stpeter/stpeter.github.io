<h2>Solstice Moons</h2>

<h3>2010-12-21</h3>
<p>Last night in this part of the world we experienced a lunar eclipse on the winter solstice, which supposedly won't happen again until the year 2094. It made me think a full moon we had on the solstice back in 1999, and the <a href="/writings/fire/sky.html">poem</a> I wrote then for a friend I've since lost track of...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
My friend, this solstice moon reminds me to look up at the sky --<br>
the brightest moon in a hundred years, they say, but right now I<br>
can't make out the features I like best for all this blinding light:<br>
the features my father taught to me on moonless winter nights<br>
when we would walk up to Clifton Park (where summers I played ball)<br>
and peer at the deep of space to find the Dippers large and small,<br>
the twins, the bull, Orion's Belt, but most of all the Queen's Chair,<br>
my favorite because harder to find and closer to my scale<br>
and the scale of my father's love -- my eye seeks it even still<br>
among the million numberless stars, the stars that I feel will,<br>
fighting distance, connect me to you, to my passed father's life,<br>
to the numberless millions who lived on earth before my time,<br>
to the numberless more who'll live here once I'm gone -- or who may,<br>
for all I know, not live here at all but venture out away<br>
into space, expand the home of man -- for them the stars will be<br>
their park (will they play with comets as I played ball?) -- yet I see<br>
in my mind's eye that sometimes they'll look back at where the earth must lie<br>
and feel as I do when, thinking of you, I look up at the sky.
</p>

<p>Scott, that's for you, wherever you might be...</p>
