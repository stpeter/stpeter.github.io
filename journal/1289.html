<h2>Santa the Spy</h2>
<h3>2008-12-07</h3>
<p>Some Christmas songs are a bit spooky. I'm thinking especially of "Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town", which makes that merry old elf out to be almost Orwellian. Since I like to write alternate lyrics to songs, I made the following adaptation of "Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town"...</p>
<p>
You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry<br>
You'd better not pout, I'm telling you why<br>
Santa Claus is comin' to town!</p>
<p>
He's making a list, he's checking it twice<br>
His database says who's naughty or nice<br>
Santa Claus is comin' to town!</p>
<p>
He spies on you in the night-time<br>
He spies on you in the day<br>
He keeps track of all your movements<br>
He works for the CIA</p>
<p>
You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry<br>
You'd better not pout, I'm telling you why<br>
Santa Claus is comin' to town!</p>
<p>
The kids in Girl and Boy Land<br>
They never will be free<br>
They're in the Santa Youth League<br>
They'll conform like you and me</p>
<p>
You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry<br>
You'd better not pout, I'm telling you why<br>
Santa Claus is comin' to town!</p>
