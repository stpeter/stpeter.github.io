<h3>2003-01-10</h3>
<p>After a long hiatus, I decided to re-join the <a href="http://www.epicurus.net/epl.html">Epicurean Philosophy List</a>, an email discussion group devoted to <a href="http://www.atomic-swerve.net/tpg/">Epicurus</a>. It's good to be back. There is much wisdom to be found in Epicurean insights, even though they are 2300 years old. Indeed, his ideas are surprisingly modern in many ways. So far I've mentioned my interest in writing an essay on Nietzsche and Epicurus (probably for the <a href="http://www.swan.ac.uk/german/fns/jns.htm">Journal of Nietzsche Studies</a>), which was well-received on the list. I'm still amazed that no one has really delved into this topic; I have not yet read Marcin Milkowski's paper <a href="http://venus.ci.uw.edu.pl/~milek/epicurus.htm">Idyllic heroism: Nietzsche's View of Epicurus</a>, but its focus seems to be more hermeneutical than historical. So perhaps I'll be able to break new ground here.</p>
