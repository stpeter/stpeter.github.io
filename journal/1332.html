<p>The primary thesis of my book-in-progress <a href="/writings/roark/">The Tao of Roark</a> is that human beings have four primary capacities or powers: thought, choice, action, and feeling. The text as it is emerging really is a spinning-out of that thesis -- variations on a theme by Ayn Rand, if you will.</p>
<p>As with any advanced theme-and-variations (oh, say, Rachmaninoff's <cite>Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini</cite>), sometimes the variations can sound quite distant from the original theme. <cite>The Tao of Roark</cite> is no exception. Even I am not even quite sure where this philosophical exploration is taking me, because I keep finding new integrations and connections. Recently, spurred by reading my friend Nicholas Dykes' book <a href="1262.html">Old Nick's Guide to Happiness</a> and also Adam Smith's <cite>Theory of Moral Sentiments</cite>, I have been thinking about the application of thought, choice, action, and especially feeling to three primary areas of life: what we might call the factual, the social, and the personal.</p>
<p>One of my friend Nick's great insights is that in order to live a consistent and happy life, I need to recognize the same rights and capacities in others that I realize in myself. It simply will not do to assert my own right to self-fulfillment if I do not simultaneously recognize that right in others. In an evocative image, Nick likens this natural duality to a tuning fork, in which the two sides of the fork (my rights and your rights) grow out of the same root.</p>
<p>I see this as related to Smith's notion of sympathy or fellow-feeling. Yes, I have the capacity to perceive, experience, feel; but so do you! If I am to rightly honor the human capacity to feel, I need to respect your perceptions and experiences and feelings. This perhaps seems far from the Randian notion of "judge, and be prepared to be judged"; but consider Roark's interactions with Steven Mallory in <cite>The Fountainhead</cite>, in which Roark illustrates that he can be quite finely attuned to the feelings of a fellow human being. (Similar considerations apply to respecting others' capacities for thought and choice and action.)</p>
<p>Not that strict coherence with <cite>The Fountainhead</cite> or Rand's philosophy is the purpose of <cite>The Tao of Roark</cite> -- these are variations on a theme by Ayn Rand, not a literal performance of the original on period instruments. And that's probably why I'm so enjoying the challenge of writing of this book.</p>
