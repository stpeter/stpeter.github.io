<p>I just switched to the America theme for this page. I'm not a big flag-waving, America-love-it-or-leave-it kind of American (after all I'm half Dutch :), but we've definitely had the flag flying at our house of late -- although ours is of the thirteen-stars variety. I've always liked that <a href="http://www.usflag.org/historical/betsyross.gif">Betsy Ross flag</a>, I guess it's my libertarian leanings and respect for the ideals of the American Revolution. (Coincidentally, right now I'm listening to Paul Simon's song "America", though in a live version by <a href="http://www.yesworld.com/">Yes</a>. Their version is much more celebratory than S&amp;G's, and of course it clocks in at over ten minutes -- gotta love progressive rock!)</p>
<p>I sure would love a better interface between Jabber and weblogs. My friend Dizzy has been working on an XML-RPC component that would enable people to post blog updates from their Jabber clients (such as my favorite, <a href="http://gabber.sourceforge.net/">Gabber</a>). But he's so busy that he hasn't had time to polish it up for general consumption. Maybe if I cook him some extra-special Thai food he'll be motivated to finish it off. :)</p>
