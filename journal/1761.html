<h2>Metaphysics in Verse II</h2>

<h3>2023-01-23</h3>
<p>Among the strangest conceptions of metaphysics is Aristotle's fanciful (or perhaps deadly serious) hypothesis of the Unmoved Mover. It's difficult to understand quite what he was getting at, and I'm not about to formulate a scholarly exegesis of the idea. But I did compose a little poem about it:</p>
<blockquote>
Had I a god, I’m sure it’d be<br>
The sum of all felicity,<br>
Which joys in pure activity -<br>
<br>
Whose every action is a thought,<br>
Whose every insight is what’s sought,<br>
Who ever does just what it ought.<br>
<br>
This god all things would emulate:<br>
Not serve, but strive to re-create<br>
Within the limits of their state.<br>
<br>
What this would mean for humankind<br>
Is not that we would leave behind<br>
What’s animal, but honor mind.
</blockquote>
