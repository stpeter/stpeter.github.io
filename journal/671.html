<h2>High School</h2>

    <p>Paul Graham's essay <a href="http://paulgraham.com/nerds.html">Why Nerds are Unpopular</a> is just about the best description I've ever read of American public high schools (from which I <a href="/tech/brutal.html">didn't graduate</a>). Now he's published another essay on the same general topic, consisting of a <a href="http://paulgraham.com/hs.html">graduation speech</a> that he never got to deliver because the folks in charge of the school probably realized how radically seditious it was. As my friends across the pond would say: spot on.</p>
