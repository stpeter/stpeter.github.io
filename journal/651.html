<h2>Swimming in New Waters</h2>
<h3>2004-12-14</h3>
    <p>Apropos of my <a href="648.html">recent complaint</a> about begging bloggers, Doc <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2004/12/14#saidWhat">further explores</a> the intersection of blogs and money. Although I continue to doubt that micropayments will ever take off, I do think that we're <a href="455.html">learning</a> to <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2003/11/01#oneCreatorAtATime">swim in the new waters</a> engendered by the <a href="http://theheadlemur.typepad.com/ravinglunacy/2003/11/a_new_business_.html">electronic tsunami</a>. I don't know how money fits in, but Doc is probably close to the mark when he says that (some) folks will make money <em>because of</em> their blogging activities, not directly <em>from</em> their blogging activities (the blogosphere seems similar in this way to the open-source community). What we're witnessing is Schumpeter's creative destruction at work -- a phenomenon well captured by Doc's phrase "re-industrialization". New connections are being made and old ones are being torn asunder. What ultimately results from this process is anybody's guess, but I doubt that traditional publishers of books, newspapers, and magazines will be playing a dominant role in the noosphere of the future. The same probably goes for the record companies, radio networks, and television studios.</p>
    <p>May you live in interesting times...</p>
