<h2>Nietzsche's Teachings</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>

<h3>2024-03-26</h3>
<p>The other day a friend of mine asked me for my overall assessment of Friedrich Nietzsche. At first I jokingly replied that each of the seventy-two poems in my book <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite> might present a unique perspective, whereas all together they might not yield a unitary view. Then I decided to re-read the book, which led me to identify six main themes in what I take to be Nietzsche's positive philosophy of life:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be radically honest with yourself, with the goal of enlightenment.</li>
  <li>Find your own truth, with the goal of liberation.</li>
  <li>Craft your own life, with the goal of independence.</li>
  <li>Cultivate what is near and dear, with the goal of simplicity.</li>
  <li>Be moderate and self-controlled, with the goal of tranquility.</li>
  <li>Pursue work over happiness, with the goal of greatness.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a reason, perhaps, why the two words most often rhymed in these poems are "soul" and "goal", for it strikes me that Nietzsche's overarching message is the deep significance of self-mastery.</p>
