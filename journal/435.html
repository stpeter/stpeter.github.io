<p>Human beings are fascinated with the search for life on other planets (that and the <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/030929/misc/29dating.htm">search for love</a>). Perhaps not least because the discovery of extraterrestrial life (and especially intelligent life) would have <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2003/09/davies.htm">fascinating theological implications</a>. Personally I see no reason to think that the third planet out from an inconsequential star in a middling suburb of the Milky Way galaxy would attract the kind of interest that makes UFOlogists believe Earth is the Grand Central Station of the universe. But I also find it hard to believe that, in the vastness of all that exists, there is no other life. It's a big universe: someone's got to populate it.</p>
