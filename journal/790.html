<h2>Down East</h2>

<p>I was up in Freeport, Maine over the weekend ever so briefly for my sister's wedding. A good time was had by all, though I can do without 100% humidity (Denver has me spoiled in the weather department). I also noticed that Routes 1 and 60 near Logan Airport have more donut shops per capita than any other location on the planet. At one intersection I saw two Dunkin Donuts stores across the street from each other. Weird.</p>
