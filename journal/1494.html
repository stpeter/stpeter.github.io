<h2>Anthem: The Definitive Text</h2>
<h3>2013-09-12</h3>
<p>When I launched the <a href="http://www.monadnock.net/">Monadnock Valley Press</a> in 2008, the first text I published was Ayn Rand's novella <a href="http://www.monadnock.net/rand/anthem.html">Anthem</a>. Over time I came to discover some errors in the existing published versions, which led me to complete <a href="http://www.monadnock.net/rand/anthem-notes.html">extensive research</a> on the book's publishing history (culminating in a visit to the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress in April 2012). As a result, the Monadnock Valley Press edition restores the definitive text of this important dystopian novel for the first time in over 65 years. Now everyone can read the novel just as the author intended, without needing to track down a rare first edition.</p>
<p>Thus it's fitting that <cite>Anthem</cite> is now the first public domain text that the Monadnock Valley Press has published in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anthem-Definitive-Text-Ayn-Rand/dp/0615876773/">paperback</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anthem-Definitive-Text-Annotated-ebook/dp/B00F4C546Y/">Kindle</a> versions. They are only $4.99 and $0.99 respectively (I like to keep prices low), so if you're a fan of Ayn Rand or the dystopian genre in general (Zamyatin, Orwell, Huxley, etc.), please consider buying a copy. If the Press can sell enough books, we plan to buy the publishing rights to various orphaned works so that they too can be freed into the public domain.</p>
