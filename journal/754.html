<h2>13 Books</h2>
<h3>2005-05-24</h3>
    <p>Two weeks ago, Don Boudreaux over at <a href="http://cafehayek.typepad.com/">Cafe Hayek</a> listed the <a href="http://cafehayek.typepad.com/hayek/2005/05/twelve_books.html">twelve books</a> that have most influenced his thinking in economics. In fact he treated himself to a baker's dozen by adding an extra book, so since I <a href="224.html">love the number 13</a> I figured I would follow his lead by listing (in roughly chronological order) the 13 books that have had the greatest influence on my mental life:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
<a href="http://isbn.nu/0451175123">The Fountainhead</a> by Ayn Rand. Yes, it usually begins with Ayn Rand, or at least it did for me. I read this book nine times as a teenager but have not read it in twenty years (I tried to pick it up a few times but got turned off). One of these days I'll re-read it (as I have done in the last few years with Rand's other novels), but even though I disagree with much of her philosophy at this point, I know that Rand's ideas continue to influence me in many ways.</li>
      <li>
<a href="http://isbn.nu/0691099502">Complete Works</a> by Aristotle. I basically majored in Aristotle back in college, which has quite influenced my style of thinking about problems. I'm currently (if slowly) re-reading all of Aristotle, which will enable me to determine how much influence his thought still holds for me.</li>
      <li>
<a href="http://isbn.nu/0872202429">The Epicurus Reader</a> by Epicurus. From Aristotle I moved on to Epicurus. I appreciate the less scholastic approach of Epicurus to ethics and life in general, and his enlightened hedonism still holds quite an appeal for me. But I know that I'm too much of a modern American workaholic to follow his core ideas of pursuing mental calmness (ataraxia) and living in obscurity (lathe biosas).</li>
      <li>
<a href="http://isbn.nu/0394719859">Die Froehliche Wissenschaft</a> by Friedrich Nietzsche. After reading Rand, Aristotle, and Epicurus I absorbed a lot of Nietzsche, and a year or two ago I re-read his complete writings in English. To me, <cite>Die Froehliche Wissenschaft</cite> (a title often translated into English as "The Gay Science", through I prefer the Provencal subtitle of "la gaya scienza") captures Nietzsche at his most positive and thought-provoking.</li>
      <li>
<a href="http://isbn.nu/055334935X">Tao Te Ching</a> by Lao Tzu. Well, one needs to relax after all that serious philosophizing. I still feel that the gnomic expressions of Lao Tzu provide an attractive antidote to the categorical thinking characteristic of Western philosophy. That doesn't mean I'm a spontaneous free spirit, but I try to cultivate that side of my personality despite (or perhaps because of) the fact that I am essentially a categorizing, logical person.</li>
      <li>
<a href="http://isbn.nu/0226978656">A Soviet Heretic</a> by Yevgeny Zamyatin. Zamyatin is one of my big favorites -- a true individualist who provides deep insights into culture, society, and human experience.</li>
      <li>
<a href="http://isbn.nu/0679724532">The Gnostic Gospels</a> by Elaine Pagels. About as close I've gotten to Christianity since I became a non-believer at the age of nine. But I find Gnostic thought to be quite appealing in many ways.</li>
      <li>
<a href="http://isbn.nu/0140422226">Complete Poems</a> by Walt Whitman. True Americanism. A wonderful corrective to elitist thinkers like Rand and Nietzsche, with quite a whiff of Gnostic ideals mixed in, suitably democratized for the American experience.</li>
      <li>
<a href="http://isbn.nu/0913966576">The Evolution of Civilizations</a> by Carroll Quigley. I think this is one of the most important books published in the twentieth century. The best analysis I have read of the origin and meaning of human civilizations.</li>
      <li>
<a href="http://isbn.nu/0140139966">How Buildings Learn</a> by Stewart Brand. The power of vernacular, low-road, truly organic architecture -- and, by extension, vernacular, low-road, truly organic thinking.</li>
      <li>
<a href="http://isbn.nu/0195069056">Albion's Seed</a> by David Hackett Fischer. The story of the transmission of America's founding cultures from the British Isles. This book gave me a deep appreciation for culture as opposed to ideology or philosophy.</li>
      <li>
<a href="http://isbn.nu/0205370713">Evolutionary Psychology</a> by David Buss. Although this is "just" a textbook, it provides the best overview yet written of the ongoing application of evolutionary insights to human psychology.</li>  
      <li>
<a href="http://isbn.nu/0198297297">The Structure of Liberty</a> by Randy Barnett. The possibility of anarchism. I don't know if I'm really an anarchist, but I don't much believe in government anymore (where I use "believe" in the same sense here that I use when I call myself a religious non-believer), and this book more than any other led me in that direction.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note that I've read many of these books only in the last few years, so as I read more I'll likely update my list of 13 most influential books. Or at least I hope so: better to keep growing intellectually, especially in these interesting times!</p>
