<h2>James P. Hogan, RIP</h2>
<h3>2010-07-13</h3>
<p>I'm saddened to learn that <a href="http://www.jamesphogan.com/">James P. Hogan</a>, one of my favorite science fiction authors, <a href="http://www.jamesphogan.com/mailarchive/index.php?issuenumber=59">died yesterday</a>. Although I don't read much SF these days and haven't in years, for a while there I devoured every JPH novel I could get my hands on. I think that the one I liked best was <a href="http://www.jamesphogan.com/books/book.php?titleID=2&amp;ed=4">Code of the Lifemaker</a> -- the last scene sticks out in my mind as a tour de force of tongue-in-cheek description. He and I corresponded via email for a few years because I maintained a <a href="http://www.monadnock.net/fanspaces/">FanSpace</a> about him at the old version of my <a href="http://monadnock.net">monadnock.net website</a>. He was quite an original, heretical person and the world is worse off for having lost him.</p>
