<h2>Bus Factor</h2>
<h3>2007-01-26</h3>
    <p>The other day I almost got run over at the intersection of Wynkoop and 18th Streets in downtown Denver (no, don't panic, it wasn't <em>that</em> close -- but if you drive a dark green Ford pickup truck with Colorado license plate 660-KJK, please know that you are a stop-sign-running, cell-phone-talking idiot who needs to pay closer attention to his driving). The experience made me realize that I really need to write up a README describing everything I do in running the <a href="https://xmpp.org/xsf/">XMPP Standards Foundation</a> -- routine tasks, necessary passwords, relevant contacts, and so on. I already have a <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/XEP-README.html">README</a> for the role of the XMPP Extensions Editor, but a more general "stpeter.readme" is in order, too. I'll add that to my dotplan for sure.</p>
