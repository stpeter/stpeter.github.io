<h2>Spidering Jabber</h2>

    <p>One of the things that makes the web work so well is search: type in what you're looking for and a search engine returns a whole bunch of page results. To me, the holy grail for Jabber is this: type in who you're looking for and a search engine returns a whole bunch of people results. ICQ has always had a basic search feature for people on the ICQ service, but I think we can do much better on the Jabber network. Here's why:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We have a real URI scheme, which I'm working to finalize soon at the IETF. This means anyone can link to resources on the Jabber/XMPP network.</li>
      <li>We have <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0054.html">vCards</a> and, soon, a much more robust <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0154.html">profile data</a> system. This means you'll be able to search on name, place, employer, expertise, interests, hobbies, zodiac sign, and so on.</li>
      <li>You can search not just for people, but also for chatrooms, content syndication feeds, and so on.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To make this dream a reality, we need two things:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Folks need to starting linking to people and services on the Jabber/XMPP network (e.g., my Jabber ID is <a href="xmpp:stpeter@jabber.org">stpeter@jabber.org</a>, I'm an admin for the <a href="xmpp:jabber.org">jabber.org server</a>, and I sometimes hang out in the <a href="xmpp:jdev@conference.jabber.org">jdev chatroom</a>).</li>
      <li>Google (or someone very much like Google) needs to start spidering the Jabber/XMPP network by sending <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0030.html">service discovery</a>, vCard, and (soon) profile requests to xmpp: URIs.</li>
    </ol>
