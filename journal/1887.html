<h2>Nicholas Dykes, RIP</h2>

<h3>2024-08-01</h3>
<p>Today I was saddened to learn, belatedly, that my friend Nicholas Dykes passed away earlier this year. Nick and I corresponded on and off for 25 years, ever since I published his poems "First Call of a Redwing" and "On Mynydd Troed" in The Monadnock Review, a webzine I maintained from 1997 to 2002. I was lucky to spend a few hours with him in person back in 2006 after the memorial service for British libertarian writer and activist Chris Tame, since I just happened to be London at that time and took the train down to Chichester for the event. Although Nick had strong opinions and took exception to my book <cite>The Tao of Roark</cite> (if I recall correctly, he thought it was repetitious and unenlightening), we always enjoyed sharing thoughts about philosophy and literature. I really liked his novel <cite>Old Nick's Guide to Happiness</cite> (a kind of philosophical adventure story) and was looking forward to the novel he was working on at the time of his death, about a lost island of Epicureans in the Indian Ocean. He will be missed. Rest in peace, my friend.</p>
