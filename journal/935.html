<h3>2006-05-08</h3>
    <p>The Times (UK) is running a <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2099-2155555,00.html">fascinating article</a> about Craig Newmark and Jim Buckmaster of <a href="http://www.craigslist.com/">Craigslist</a>. My favorite paragraph:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"We are in a period where power is being redistributed," says Newmark. The current shift is akin to "the glorious revolution in Britain", he says, when the powers of the monarchy were eclipsed in favour of parliament. "Power was redistributed from a very small number of people to a larger number of people. Now we are seeing a shift of a similar magnitude. There are people fighting that, but they are going to lose," he says. "Authoritarianism doesn't sell."</p>
