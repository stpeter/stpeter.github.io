<p>OK, so I went <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/egosurf.html">ego surfing</a>. Not much else to do when you're overtired and have had a bit too much wine with dinner. In addition to the usual plethora of Jabber links, I found some fine sites like <a href="http://swannieuk.blogspot.com/">Swannie's Blog</a> (it's good to know that someone other than me and David Sutton is interested in <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html">JEP-0045</a>) and <a href="http://www.khava.com/">Khava</a> (who <a href="http://www.khava.com/journal/2002/0319.html">claims</a> that I'm "practically an Objectivist legend"). It's a bit weird sometimes to straddle the two worlds of Jabber software and Randian scholarship -- some people know me from one or the other, but very few (probably only <a href="http://oconnor.cx/smyrno/">Ted O'Connor</a>) know me from both. Then there are those who know me from worlds in which I'm even less active, such as <a href="/writings/fire/">poetry</a> and <a href="/music/">music</a>. Speaking of music, right now I'm listening to the piano pieces that <a href="http://www.monkey.org/~jefrey/">Jeffrey Lindon</a> wrote based on seven of my <a href="/writings/fire/urban.html">Urban Haiku</a>. I continue to enjoy them a lot (you can download several of them at Jeffrey's <a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/98/jeffrey_lindon.html">mp3.com page</a>). One of these years I'll record some of the music I've written -- my <a href="/music/aubade/">solo guitar works</a> will come first, after which I'll do my <a href="/music/hagiography/">songs</a>. I promise, I really do!</p>
