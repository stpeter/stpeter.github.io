<h2>Eudaimonia Suite</h2>

<p>On thinking further about <a href="1504.html">my lifelong philosophy project</a>, I've come to see it as a six-part suite on the theme of eudaimonia. Just I have <a href="1489.html">likened</a> my set of <a href="/music/yes/">Yes arrangements</a> for solo electric bass to a Bach Cello Suite, so the six books I'm writing on the philosophy of happiness might comprise a kind of suite:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="/writings/roark/">The Tao of Roark</a> is a prelude in several senses: extravagant, improvisatory, fantastical even, and redolent of my intellectually intemperate youth under the influence of Ayn Rand.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="/writings/nietzsche/">Songs of Zarathustra</a> simply must be an allemande: a serious, German dance - yet also, I hope, tinged with some of the Mediterranean lightness that Nietzsche so treasured.</p></li>
<li><p>My book on Aristotle (<a href="/writings/aristotle/">A Worthy Life</a>) will have the character of a courante: majestic and magisterial despite its brevity, it will likely be a short commentary on key themes from Aristotelian ethics (in the tradition of Averroes, Albertus Magnus, and Thomas Aquinas, albeit on a smaller, more intimate scale).</p></li>
<li><p>From that high plane we will turn to a thinker who is in many ways the <a href="428.html">opposite of Aristotle</a>: Thoreau. Here we proceed at a leisurely, loping pace in the sarabande, entitled <a href="/writings/thoreau/">The Upland Farm</a>. (Perhaps four "seasonal" essays sprinkled with short poems, as Thoreau liked to do?)</p></li>
<li><p>Next the bourr√©e: <a href="/writings/epicurus/">Letters on Happiness: An Epicurean Dialogue</a>. We find a kind of sober simplicity here, providing a counterpoint to Nietzsche's Dionysian pessimism.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally a dancing gigue at the end, probably a set of aphorisms, poems, and parables inspired by the Old Master Lao Tzu. A fitting way to finish the suite, especially given our start with Rand.</p></li>
</ol> 
<p>I like this arrangement quite a bit, since the three pairs of contrasting thinkers (Rand and Lao Tzu, Nietzsche and Epicurus, Aristotle and Thoreau) are arrayed in a mirror image through the first and last, second and fifth, and third and fourth movements.</p>
