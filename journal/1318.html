<h2>Seven Things</h2>

<p>So there's this whole "seven things" meme going around. Someone posts seven things you might not know about them at their blog, then they tag seven others to do the same. A chain letter for the 21st century and all that. I was chatting with <a href="http://www.nata2.org/">Harper Reed</a> earlier today and I noticed that he got tagged, which reminded me that <a href="http://hyperstruct.net/2009/2/4/seven-things-you-may-want-to-ignorewwwwmay-not-know-about-me">Massimiliano Mirra tagged me</a> just before <a href="http://fosdem.org/">FOSDEM</a> but I was too busy to post my reply. So here's a list of seven things about me that might not be very well known:</p>
<ol>
<li>I didn't graduate from <a href="http://mcs.maranacook.org/">high school</a> the first time around, so I went to a second school for a postgraduate year before attending <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a>.</li>
<li>During my first two years of college I worked at IBM's <a href="http://www.watson.ibm.com/">Watson Research Laboratory</a> on techniques for molecular beam epitaxy.</li>
<li>After college I taught English as a second language at the <a href="http://www.cez.cz/en/power-plants-and-environment/nuclear-power-plants/temelin.html">Temel√≠n Nuclear Power Station</a> (then under construction in southern Bohemia).</li>
<li>One of the best things that ever happened to me was getting fired from my job as an editor at <a href="http://www.mfsmithllc.com/">M.F. Smith &amp; Co.</a>, since it forced me to get my first job working on Internet technologies back in 1996 (though being escorted from the building in the pouring rain wasn't very fun).</li>
<li>I've been playing guitar since I was 13 years old -- longer than lots of Jabber developers have been alive. :)</li>
<li>I'm not really a geek -- I studied philosophy and ancient Greek in college (well, in fact I mostly played guitar).</li>
<li>I have 72 first cousins. I think. :) Whatever the number, it's a lot.</li>
</ol>
