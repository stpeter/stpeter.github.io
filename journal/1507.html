<h2>Eternal Recurrence</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>

<h3>2014-04-15</h3>
<p>I'm still struggling mightily with finding my voice on this Nietzsche project - not trying to represent exactly what Nietzsche wrote (which is notoriously slippery anyway), but providing my perspective on his ideas in a way that does justice to what I see as the core truth in his texts. Plus huge questions are swirling in my head about whether I can pull this off philosophically and poetically!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I'm going to try. As my colleague <a href="https://adambrault.com/">Adam Brault</a> says: "What the heck. Why not?" :-)</p>
<p>Over the weekend, I wrote the first draft of the first poem for <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite>. There's no guarantee it will survive my usual self-editing process, but here it is anyway...</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Eternal Recurrence</strong><br><br>
What if<br>
I've lived this hour, this day, this life<br>
Before<br>
And I<br>
Must live them yet again, not once<br>
But more<br>
And more,<br>
Until every experience<br>
Repeats,<br>
Recurs,<br>
And doubles back a million times<br>
Or more.
<br><br>
A curse!<br>
And yet if it must be, what if<br>
I bless<br>
This fact<br>
As much as if it were my choice,<br>
Not less.<br>
The less<br>
I treat necessity as fate<br>
The more<br>
I love<br>
The life I live, and live the life<br>
I bless.
