<h2>Where Are the Scenarios?</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>

<h3>2009-03-13</h3>
<p>Given all the bad news these days (and remember, it's "news", produced by companies who have learned that sensationalism sells), I hear a lot of doomsday stories accompanied by catchy acronyms like <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/SHTF">SHTF</a> and even <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/TEOTWAWKI">TEOTWAWKI</a>. What I don't see are well-reasoned analyses that lay out multiple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario_planning">scenarios</a> and assign probabilities to those scenarios. Because most of history is a matter of muddling through (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_reversion">reversion to the mean</a> always tends to be the order of the day), I rather doubt that a new Dark Ages is right around the corner. Sure, it's possible, but what are the probabilities, based on current evidence, historical extrapolation, and scientific reasoning? Pointers are welcome. :)</p>
