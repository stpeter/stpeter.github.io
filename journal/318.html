<h2>POP Culture, II</h2>

<h3>2002-12-01</h3>
<p>There is some other interesting stuff at the <a href="http://www.ifi.uio.no/~thomas/po/articles.html">post-objectivism site</a>, including a <a href="http://folk.uio.no/thomas/po/buddhists-and-objectivists.html">call for dialogue</a> between Buddhists and Randians (not as far-fetched as you might think), a fine <a href="http://folk.uio.no/thomas/po/minsaas-interview.html">interview</a> with literary scholar Kirsti Minsaas, <a href="http://folk.uio.no/thomas/po/the-culture.html">reflections</a> on the Culture novels of SF writer Iain Banks, and some intriguing essays on Rand and feminism. I happen to be a female chauvinist, so the latter essays strike a chord with me. But I find it hard to accept statements such as the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Feminists, as a rule, assume that there are few if any inherent, unchangeable differences between men and women; only a lot of individual differences and variation. (Thomas Gramstad, <a href="http://folk.uio.no/thomas/po/whatisfeminism.html">What is Feminism?</a>)</p>
<p>"Man" and "woman" are social-cultural categories, not biological ones. (Thomas Gramstad, <a href="http://folk.uio.no/thomas/po/vive-les-differences.html">Vive Les Differences</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I appreciate Gramstad's call for a <a href="http://folk.uio.no/thomas/po/real-biology.html">biological individualism</a>, it does no good to ignore aggregate biological differences. This is not some primitive sociobiology, but more and more simple biological fact (read Steven Pinker's book <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~pinker/slate.html">The Blank Slate</a> for an overview and pointers to the research results). It's downright silly to say that 'man' and 'woman' are purely socio-cultural categories -- would we say the same thing of our near-relatives the chimps, orangutans, and gorillas, or animals such as dogs, horses, pigs, ad cattle ("don't be so patriarchal, 'bull' and 'cow' are purely socio-cultural categories, not biological ones")? However, admitting that there are aggregate biological differences between the sexes does not imply collectivism or a desire to ignore individual differences. The dogma of the blank slate is not the only defense against simplistic stereotyping, nor the best one (since the evidence proves it false).</p>
