<h2>Pyrrhiad</h2>

<h3>2024-07-08</h3>
<p>For some time now I've toyed with the idea of writing a novel (provisionally entitled <cite>Gods Among Men</cite>) about Alexander the Great and the founder of philosophical skepticism, Pyrrho. Having recently re-read both the <cite>Iliad</cite> and the <cite>Odyssey</cite>, I'm wondering if I could structure the story as an epic poem, almost as if it were translated from the work of an ancient Greek poet deeply influenced by Homer. Here's a draft of the standard invocation of the muse to start things off:</p>
<blockquote>
Sing me, muse, of two men who lived as gods.<br>
So many were the lands through which they passed,<br>
So many were the minds from which they learned<br>
While, by the one man seeking to rule all<br>
And by the other reaching out to know,<br>
They travelled far from Greece to India.<br>
First Alexander, King of Maked≈çn,<br>
Whose fame will last as long as men shall live:<br>
Just as a huge wave crashes on the shore<br>
And smashes all before it when the earth<br>
Afar is shaken by Poseidon's rage,<br>
So Alexander broke upon the East,<br>
Forever changing all within his wake.<br>
Then second, sing me, too, of one who lived<br>
Unknown, yet rivalled Zeus for happiness:<br>
Although he conquered nothing in his path,<br>
His path led him to conquering within,<br>
To mastery of no one but himself;<br>
For wisdom brought him deep serenity.<br>
From Elis, the Epeians' land, he came;<br>
Son of Pleistarchos, Pyrrho was his name.<br>
<br>
O muse, come be my ally, for I doubt<br>
The texture of the tale I dare to tell:<br>
Its warp and woof are lost within the past,<br>
Beyond recovery, uncertain, dim;<br>
At this late date the details cannot be<br>
Defined with clarity; so, uninclined<br>
To this interpretation or to that,<br>
I flow within the stream of what has been<br>
And joy to tell the story of a world<br>
That had such giants in it, long ago.<br>
Dread goddess, Zeus' daughter, let us start<br>
When Pyrrho in his youth took mind to heart...<br>
