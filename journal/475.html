<p>Roderick Long notes that America seems to be <a href="http://praxeology.net/unblog12-03.htm#06">stuck with the two-party system</a>. Although I would prefer to have the option of a true alternative for freedom (rather than the tweedledee and tweedledum of interventionism that we have now), William Niskanen makes a pretty strong case that <a href="http://www.cato.org/dailys/05-07-03.html">divided government is better than united government</a>, at least when it comes to holding back the tide of state power. After all, our currently united government (House, Senate, and Presidency all held by the Republicans) has <a href="http://www.cato.org/dailys/12-23-03.html">betrayed its small-government rhetoric</a> (as if <em>that</em> was ever sincere!). Is there a <a href="http://reason.com/links/links101403.shtml">libertarian case for voting Democratic</a>? The <a href="http://libertariansfordean.blogspot.com/">Libertarians for Dean</a> seem to think so, and I tend to agree -- not out of any great love for the Democratic Party, but because voting these days is more a matter of self-defense than anything else. Two cheers for gridlock!</p>
