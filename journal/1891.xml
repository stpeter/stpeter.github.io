<entry>
<p>Following up on my previous postings about the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite>, here is one possible rendering of the very last poem, number 81:</p>
<blockquote>
The true words aren't the pretty words<br/>
The pretty words are far from true<br/>
The good man argues not at all<br/>
The arguer is far from good<br/>
The wise man doesn't know it all<br/>
The know-it-all is far from wise<br/>
<br/><br/>
The sages aren't acquisitive<br/>
The more they help, the more they have<br/>
The more they give, the more they gain<br/>
The Way of Heaven is to help and do no harm<br/>
The Way of sages is to act and not compete
</blockquote>
<p>I love how Lao Tzu ends by saying, in beautiful words, that beautiful words are far from true. That's quite a twist and makes you ponder the meaning of the entire book...</p>
