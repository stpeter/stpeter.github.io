<h2>RFCs 7247 and 7248: SIP-XMPP Interop</h2>
<h3>2014-05-21</h3>
<p>A long time ago in an Internet far, far away, there happened a series of skirmishes known as the Instant Messaging Protocol Wars, involving brave warriors from the SIP and XMPP communities. Words were exchanged, epithets were hurled, swords were drawn, hand-to-hand combat ensued at IETF meetings, and much blood was shed. All for naught - as with most wars - because the real enemy (proprietary systems) invaded vast swaths of territory in the meantime.</p>
<p>Eventually, the combatants realized the error of their ways and sought a peaceful resolution to their conflict. Internet-Drafts were written, terms of cooperation were discussed, a <a href="http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/stox/">working group</a> was formed, and formal activity commenced. Six documents have resulted from this initiative, one each for core interoperability, presence, instant messaging, one-to-one chat, groupchat, and media signaling. Today, the first two of these specifications were published as RFCs: <a href="http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7247/">RFC 7247</a> (core) and <a href="http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7248/">RFC 7248</a> (presence). The other four are wending their way through the IETF's standards process and will emerge from the fog of battle sometime later this year. Stay tuned for updates. :-)</p>
