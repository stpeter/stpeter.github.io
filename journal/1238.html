<h2>Things Are Getting Done</h2>

<p>Late this afternoon as I finished up a few remaining tasks, for the first time in quite a while I had the feeling that I've been making good progress in my work. About two weeks ago I started getting serious about personal productivity by <a href="1231.html">adopting</a> David Allen's system for <a href="http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php">getting things done</a>. After a few days of taking stock of all my projects and activities, evaluating tools (I've settled on <a href="http://www.culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> for the Mac), and emptying my inbox, I've been relentlessly focusing on my highest-priority work items. Every morning I get my inbox back down to zero, catch up on offline IMs, and then take a good, hard look at the <a href="https://xmpp.org/xsf/roadmap.shtml">XMPP roadmap</a> to figure out what I really need to work on next. In the last two weeks that has meant lots of updates to the Jingle specs, a new version of <a href="https://xmpp.org/internet-drafts/draft-saintandre-rfc3920bis-05.html">rfc3920bis</a> (with a new version of <a href="https://xmpp.org/internet-drafts/draft-saintandre-rfc3921bis-04.htm">rfc3921bis</a> to be released <a href="https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/2008-June/019037.html">on Monday</a>), even (with help from Dirk Meyer and Justin Karneges) a solid proposal for a TLS-based approach to end-to-end encryption for Jabber that we're calling <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/xtls.html">XTLS</a>. Next week I think I'll start cranking out some of those mobile optimizations we talked about at the XMPP Summit in late February...</p>
