<h2>Independence Day</h2>
<h3>2005-07-04</h3>
    <p>I wonder how many millions of dollars are spent every July 4th on municipal fireworks displays that are put on in celebration of American liberty. Don't you think towns and cities could find a way to spend a small fraction of that money in actually protecting freedom rather than loudly and hypocritically expressing their devotion to it? Personally, given recent Supreme Court decisions and other developments, I don't feel much like celebrating this year.</p>
