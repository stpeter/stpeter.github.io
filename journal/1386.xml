<p>Periodically I like to make short lists of books and recordings that I would not want to do without. It helps to focus the mind. Lately I've been thinking about the 25 albums (not individual songs or pieces) that I would want on a desert island. Here's the current list, in alphabetical order by performer:</p>
<p>
Abbey Lincoln, You Gotta Pay the Band<br/>
Claudio Arrau, Chopin: Nocturnes<br/>
Dave Brubeck Quartet, Time Out <br/>
Bob Dylan, Blood on the Tracks<br/>
Duke Ellington, And His Mother Called Him Bill<br/>
Ella Fitzgerald, The Intimate Ella<br/>
Aretha Franklin, The First Twelve Sides<br/>
Glenn Gould, Bach: Goldberg Variations (1981)<br/>
Michael Hedges, Breakfast in the Field<br/>
Paul Hillier, Troubadour Songs and Medieval Lyrics<br/>
Keller Quartet, Bach: Art of the Fugue<br/>
Alicia De Larrocha, Granados: Goyescas<br/>
Jakob Lindberg, Lute Music from Scotland and France<br/>
Jacques Loussier, Plays Bach<br/>
Patricia McCarty, Bach: Cello Suites<br/>
Joni Mitchell, Blue<br/>
Tim O'Brien, Traveler<br/>
Panocha Quartet, Dvorak: Cypresses &amp; String Quartet #10 <br/>
Joe Pass, Virtuoso #3<br/>

Yes, Close to the Edge
</p>
<p>Subject to change. :)</p>
<p>And what about the 25th recording? I'd make a miscellany of individual songs and pieces of music that I love. One of these days I'll figure out which tunes would make the cut&hellip;</p>
