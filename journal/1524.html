<h2>Self-Patronage</h2>

<p>A friend recently pointed me to a fascinating essay over at the Atlantic entitled <a href="http://m.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/01/the-death-of-the-artist-and-the-birth-of-the-creative-entrepreneur/383497/">The Death of the Artist â€” and the Birth of the Creative Entrepreneur</a> by William Deresiewicz. After exploring the major financial models for artistic creation over the centuries (classic patronage, aristocratic independence, the never-popular starving artist, twentieth-century credentialed professionalism, and just recently a kind of hustling entrepreneurship), the author wonders if the artist as entrepreneur provides a model under which it is possible to create art that can serve as as a "vessel for our inner life" (since artists who are hustling for a living might tend more toward entertainment than deep and lasting art).</p>
<p>These are good questions, and they apply to more than the fine arts since they might be asked of philosophy, history, and other forms of inquiry, too. Yet I suspect that there might be more economic approaches here than the author has imagined. In particular, my financial model for the scholarly and artistic work I do is what we might call self-patronage: I strive to earn enough money from my primary career in technology that I can write and create whatever I please. I feel that acting as my own patron gives me a high degree of freedom: I don't have to worry about achieving tenure, maintaining academic respectibility, surviving the publish-or-perish treadmill, pleasing some rich benefactor, or building a large fanbase. Instead, I can take 5 or 10 years to write a book about Epicurus or Thoreau, explore fundamental truths instead of producing what some academic journal will accept for publication, spend my time on creation instead of marketing, and so on.</p>
<p>The only problem is time: I've been so busy in my career for the last 20 years that I haven't been able to devote as much time as I would have liked to philosophy or music. Yet I am starting to get more disciplined about carving out creative time, and I expect that will begin to bear fruit over the next 5 years or so...</p>
