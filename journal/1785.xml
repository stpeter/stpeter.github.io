<p>I was saddened yesterday to learn (via my friend Wayne Bethanis) that pianist-composer George Winston has died. Every solo performer of original music - not just pianists but guitarists and everyone else - owes him a debt of gratitude, for he was one of the few who blazed the trail of modern instrumental music, starting with his album <cite>Autumn</cite> in 1980. Although his music was often called "new age", he preferred the evocative term "rural folk piano". Many streams came together in his music: folk, blues, jazz, classical, rock, gospel, rhythm and blues, Hawaiian, and more. Yet he fused them into a seamless whole that was uniquely his own.</p>
<p>George Winston truly lived music as a way of life. Long ago I saw him perform at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City; in his flannel shirt and woolen socks, he was not dressed like a typical performer, but his utmost dedication to the music was evident from the first note to the last.</p>
<p>In my youth, I spent many, many hours listening to his albums <cite>Autumn</cite>, <cite>Winter Into Spring</cite>, and <cite>December</cite> on LP, which were a significant influence on my own attempts at composing music for solo guitar; if I ever get around to recording this music, it will be in part to pay homage to the incomparable artistry of George Winston.</p>
