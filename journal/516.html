<h2>Gotham</h2>
<h3>2004-03-31</h3>
    <p>I was in New York City yesterday for a last-minute business meeting. It was hardly enough time to get back into that New York state of mind, but I did soak up the busy streets, hang out in Grand Central Terminal for a bit during rush hour, take the subway uptown to my favorite Greek restaurant, etc. I even stole an hour to visit <a href="http://www.frick.org/">the Frick</a>, where I predictably enjoyed the three (!) Vermeers as well as van Dyke's portrait of <a href="http://www.frick.org/html/ptg32adf.htm">Frans Snyder</a> (one of my long-time favorites). I also found myself enjoying the Whistlers quite a bit, such as his <a href="http://www.frick.org/html/pntg78df.htm">Symphony in Grey and Green: The Ocean</a> and several of his portraits. But the two pieces I found most mesmerizing were two small cloud studies by John Constable, located in the Garden Court but not even listed in the supposedly <a href="http://www.frick.org/html/pntgls1f.htm">comprehensive listing</a> of paintings at the museum.</p>
    <p>All in all, a too-brief visit.</p>
