    <p>One of my idiosyncrasies is that when I'm starting to catch a cold, I get ravenously hungry. I'm legendary for eating all the time, but when I begin to feel sick my usually fast metabolism seems to go into overdrive. For instance, today I was not feeling very well and ate a tremendous amount of food:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>06:00: A handful of dried figs and half a cup of yogurt.</li>
      <li>06:15: A fried egg on whole-grain toast, plus half a grapefruit.</li>
      <li>06:30: Another fried egg on toast.</li>
      <li>08:00: A huge bowl of oatmeal with raisins and walnuts.</li> 
      <li>09:30: An apple.</li>
      <li>10:30: Another half cup of yogurt.</li>
      <li>11:15: A whole bunch of almonds and some dried apricots.</li>
      <li>12:15: A chicken fajita and a large bowl of beef chili.</li>
      <li>14:00: Another half cup of yogurt.</li>
      <li>16:00: Another fried egg on toast.</li>
      <li>19:00: A large plate of sausage lasagna.</li>
      <li>19:45: Two pieces of baklava and two cups of Turkish coffee.</li>
      <li>21:15: More almonds and dried apricots.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now excuse me while I rummage around in the kitchen for a snack... ;-)</p>
