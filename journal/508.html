    <p>Economic prosperity is strongly correlated with economic freedom, which is why the 2004 report on the <a href="http://www.freetheworld.com/efna.html">Economic Freedom of North America</a> makes for such interesting reading. My adopted state of Colorado is #2, while my home state of Maine is #49 (out of 60 states and provinces). This isn't just academic: according to the report, "while the average increase in per-capita GDP across U.S. states was $8,600 between 1981 and 2001, in the top third of states it increased by $11,600"; that extra $3,000 or more could mean quite a bit, especially if such differences are sustained over longer periods of time.</p>
