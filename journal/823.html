<h2>Hypocrisy?</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>

<h3>2005-12-07</h3>
    <p>A while back I started taking <a href="http://www.rtd-denver.com/">bus and light rail</a> to work when I don't ride my bike (and with a high temperature today of 3°F -- that's -16°C for you non-Americans -- I wasn't about to ride my bike!). One thing that mystifies me is the lack of a public on public transport. Last night, during an admittedly cold and snowy commute, but in the middle of the normal rush hour, I was the only person on the bus headed east from the light rail station. Where are all those enviro-conscious folks who voted for <a href="http://www.rtd-denver.com/fastracks/">FasTracks</a>? I'm sure my neighborhood is full of them, but they're not riding the bus. So who's more hypocritical: someone who voted for a massive government-funded public transport project but doesn't use public transport, or someone who voted against said project but uses public transport?</p>
