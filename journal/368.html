<h2>Jazz Friday Again</h2>

<h3>2003-04-18</h3>
<p>Last year I started a tradition of "Jazz Fridays" at work, wherein I brought some of my favorite CDs in for a colleague to listen to. Now he's restarted the tradition by loaning me a few of his favorites. I just finished listening to "Jazz Sambas" by the Leviev-Slon Quartet, and now I'm moving on to "Starlight Cafe" by Dmitri Matheny. And speaking of good jazz, I heard some really tasty playing on <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/jazzset/">Jazz Set</a> last week, courtesy of <a href="http://www.kuvo.org/">KUVO</a> in Denver. The music was provided by pianist <a href="http://www.maxjazz.com/artists/martin/bio.html">Peter Martin</a>, but it was the drumming by <a href="http://www.drummerworld.com/drummers/greghutchinson.html">Greg Hutchinson</a> that really blew me away. From the few tunes I heard, he's a creative force on the drums, and has an almost-melodic style that impressed me a lot. I'll need to find some recordings on which he's featured....</p>
