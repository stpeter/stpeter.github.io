<h2>Reflections on My Father's Life</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>
As the generations of leaves,<br>
so the generations of men.<br>
Down to earth the wind shoots the leaves,<br>
but forest trees burst forth again<br>
in the hour when spring is born:<br>
so one generation of men<br> 
dies off while another grows strong.<br>
<cite>The Iliad, VI.146-149</cite>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As the generations of leaves,<br>
so the generations of men.<br>
Yet what's the value of one leaf?<br>
Can it be just to grow the stem?<br>
I think not, but I'm not sure why:<br>
for if I say, as I am wont,<br>
that meaning's made whenever I<br>
create some value in the world,<br>
then it would seem the worth of one<br>
is only in its strength to serve,<br>
to build the beam and build the bough<br>
so others yet may bud and grow<br>
and, having built, may fall to earth<br>
when winter of their time has come.<br>
But so to speak ignores the joy<br>
and pride that comes from bringing new<br>
and unique value to the world<br>
or keeping whole what's come before,<br>
for sake of others and oneself;<br>
for there's no conflict here: we each<br>
pursue an interest in the good<br>
through single acts that are yet whole<br>
and so produce without intent<br>
a world that's better for us all.<br>
Thus my father lived: he healed men<br>
who fought in war then fought again<br>
to gain their health; he sought to save<br>
the land he loved and to preserve<br>
a life long lost through buildings that<br>
the farmers made before our time<br>
(he tried to keep their virtues, too:<br>
straight honesty with all he knew);<br>
he kept his wife till death did part<br>
and raised four children, all with love<br>
and joy in that most awesome task.<br>
And all I ask is that he gain<br>
some small amount of honor from<br>
the ones he left behind. A leaf<br>
has fallen from the tree: he lived<br>
with pride, he lived with joy, and we<br>
are better for his having lived.
