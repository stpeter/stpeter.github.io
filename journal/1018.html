<h2>A Privilege</h2>

<h3>2006-11-14</h3>
    <p>I got to pondering last night about my yet-to-be-written essay "Who's Afraid of the Public Domain?". Advocates of so-called copyright like to think that it is a natural right of the author. But those who have studied the history of copyright know that it was instituted as a government-granted and coercively-enforced privilege in order to prevent competition and to protect the monopolies of publishers and printers. I don't know about you, but I'm not a big fan of governments, monopolies, coercion, or privileges.</p>
    <p>To me, even licenses such as the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">GNU Free Documentation License</a> and the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/">Creative Commons Attribution License</a> are fine as far as they go, but they don't go far enough, since they still recognize the existence of copyright. But if I were to use such a license, I'd use the CC Attribution License (e.g., the JSF uses it for <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/">XMPP Extension Protocols</a>); I happen think it's unnecessary since there are other ways to ensure that one's authorship is recognized (hint: publish early and often), but at least it seems to do little real harm.</p>
