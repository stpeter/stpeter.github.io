<p>This piece of light verse popped into my head the other day.</p>
<p>Doggerel</p>
<p>
There is no word that rhymes with dog.<br/>
Though some appear as if they should<br/>
(The log that's fallen in the wood,<br/>
The fog that lingers on the coast),<br/>
You'll find that at the very most<br/>
Their rhymes are slant and that you can't<br/>
Just line them up and hope they sound<br/>
As up with pup or sound with hound.<br/>
The other creatures have their rhymes,<br/>
A name that rings and quickly chimes --<br/>
The cat is on the mat, of course,<br/>
The horse will run with mark√®d force --<br/>
But dogs are stuck with no such luck<br/>
And strike out when it comes to verse<br/>
(Although they seem not much the worse).<br/>
No matter how you shake your paws<br/>
At strictures of poetic laws,<br/>
There is no word that rhymes with dog.
