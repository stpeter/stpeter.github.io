<p>After further reflection on my post about the siren song of systemic solutions, I've come up with a generalization that I'm trying on for size: <em>the philosophical is the personal</em>.</p>
<p>The upshot of Carol Hanisch's dictum "the personal is the political" is that in truth there's no such thing as the purely personal, because everything personal is tinged with or completely dominated by the realm of politics. The upshot of "the philosophical is the personal" would be that in truth there's no such thing as the purely philosophical in the theoretical sense, because everything philosophical must be cashed out into a person's thoughts, choices, actions, and feelings. This would be a corollary of philosophical personalism.</p>
<p>A more radical doctrine would be that philosophical theories are utterly useless or literally have no existence, whether independent or dependent. I wouldn't go that far because we humans are conceptual beings. As always, the challenge is to find the beautifully right balance, in this case within the dialectic between theory and practice. I weight heavily toward practice, but that doesn't mean theory has no value, only that it is subservient to the needs of human life and human fulfillment. Or, as I quoted from Aristotle recently when talking about philosophical parsimony, we must bring what we say "to the test of the facts of life, and if it harmonizes with the facts we must accept it, but if it clashes with them we must suppose it to be mere theory."</p>
