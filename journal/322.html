<h2>Conducting</h2>
<h3>2002-12-04</h3>
<p>The other day, a new contract employee at <a href="http://www.jabber.com/">Jabber, Inc.</a> asked me what my role is. The best I could come up with is that I'm the conductor of the Jabber Community Orchestra: I stand up front and wave my arms around, and good things happen. I certainly don't have the technical talents possessed by most of the individual "players" in the community. But I suppose I am good at documenting the protocol and such, so maybe we're playing a concerto and I'm conducting from the piano. ;)</p>
