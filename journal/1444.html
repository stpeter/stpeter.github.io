<h2>RFC 6473: vCard Applications</h2>

<p>I thought it might be helpful to blog about each of the protocol specifications I write that gets published by the IETF in the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/RFCoverview.html">RFC series</a>. (Heck, it might also be good to explain why I spend so much time writing such specifications in the first place, but that's a topic for another post.) I've previously mentioned <a href="889.html">RFC 4417</a>, <a href="988.html">RFC 4622</a>, and a <a href="1421.html">few others</a>, but a protocol geek's work is never done so I definitely have a few more documents <a href="http://www.arkko.com/tools/allstats/petersaint-andre.html">in the pipeline</a>.</p>
<p>The latest of my publications is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6473">RFC 6473</a>, which defines an extension to the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350">vCard format</a> for electronic business cards. Typically, vCards are used by and for people, but in the Jabber community we have a long tradition of also using them for IM servers. Indeed, the core vCard spec already enables us to apply vCards to organizations and locations, so applications are a natural extension of such thinking. To indicate that a vCard applies to a software application, I defined a new value of "application" for the vcard KIND property. This spec started out by defining a value of "thing", but after discussion in the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/wg/vcarddav/">VCARDDAV Working Group</a> we decided to focus on software applications for now (although recently I've been talking with some folks who might also define a vCard KIND for hardware devices).</p>
<p>Why does this matter? Because vCards provide an open standard for profile data and there's no good reason to limit profiles to humans -- you could even say that doing so would be a form of <a href="570.html">speciesism</a>. :)</p>
