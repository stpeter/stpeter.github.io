<h2>On Happiness</h2>

<h3>2011-10-11</h3>
<p>Now that I've completed my <a href="http://monadnock.net/epicurus/">Epicurus translations</a>, I'm working on a short book that will enable modern readers to more easily understand both Epicurean theory and practice. The working title is "Epicurus on Happiness", and I plan to complete it by the end of the year.</p>
<p>After that, I'm thinking about writing a series of such books: brief explorations of thoughts on the good life from Aristotle and Nietzsche for sure, and perhaps also Thoreau, Emerson, Spinoza, the Stoics, and a few others (my book <a href="/writings/roark/">The Tao of Roark</a> can be considered the first book in the series). This extended project would provide a good reason to delve deeply into alternative approaches to the love and practice of wisdom. After all, what is more important than eudaimonia?</p>
