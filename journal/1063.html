<h2>Subject and Object</h2>
<h3>2007-03-05</h3>
    <p>While reading some essays by José Ortega y Gasset recently, I came across the following quote:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In Stendhal and in Baroja, philosophic conclusions descend to mere language, to a literary genre which serves as an instrument for literary outburst. They think in terms of "for" and "against" -- and this the thinker never does. In effect, they love and hate conceptually. Therefore, their theories are numerous. They swarm about like bacteria, disparate and antagonistic, each one engendered by the impression of the moment. <em>In the manner of songs, they tell a truth, not about things, but about the singer.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>As a songwriter, I think there's great wisdom in that last sentence.</p>
