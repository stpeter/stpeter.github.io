<h2>There Is No Such Thing As Europe</h2>

    <p>While in London recently I had dinner with Helen Szamuely, my co-blogger at <a href="http://anglosphere.com/weblog/">Albion's Seedlings</a>. In the comments <a href="http://www.chicagoboyz.net/archives/004070.html">here</a>, Helen introduces an idea she mentioned to me in person: "there is no such thing as Europe." (As noted by <a href="http://anglosphere.com/weblog/archives/000317.html">Jim Bennett</a>, the point is also made by Daniel Johnson in his most recent <a href="http://www.nysun.com/article/30759">Letter from London</a>: "The European Union is not only more diverse but also more divided than ever.")</p>
    <p>What does it mean that there is no such thing as Europe? We Americans tend to think of Europe as this monolithic entity lurking across the ocean -- we used to call it the Old World. But despite the existence of a European "union" (looking less united all the time), Europe has no enduring social reality. You can't have a functioning democracy without a demos, and there is no single demos (people) in Europe -- there are Poles and Spaniards and Swedes and Italians and English and Germans and all the rest. Can you envision a politician running for President of Europe -- say, an Austrian campaigning in Portugal and Greece and Ireland and France and the Netherlands and the Czech Republic? The very idea is risible.</p>
    <p>It is possible for many peoples or at least language communities to function together if they have a robust tradition of federalism -- the Swiss have showed that for centuries. But the EU is not the Helvetian Confederation -- it is a strongly centralized state-in-the-making, but lacking a foundation in the social reality of a people having common cultural, legal, and social assumptions. The EU is a grand experiment in nation-building, an attempt by the ruling elites of its member nations to foist their centralized, bureaucratic, one-size-fits-all decision-making on the many peoples who inhabit the European continent. I fear the consequences when those peoples realize that they've been had.</p>
    <p>UPDATE: Helen has posted <a href="http://anglosphere.com/weblog/archives/000323.html">her own thoughts</a> on the topic.</p>
