<h2>Understanding America</h2>

    <p>I have this working theory about America: it's essentially a nation full of crazy people. The basic notion is a corollary of the principle of first effective settlement -- i.e., the fundamental character of a place is set by those who settle it. Now, who settled America? For the most part, crazy Englishmen. The latter part ties America to <a href="http://www.pattern.com/bennettj-anglosphereprimer.html">the Anglosphere</a>. But it was the crazy ones who got on a creaky boat for a two-month voyage across the stormy Atlantic (with a 20% or greater chance of death) only to be plunked down in a howling wilderness with none of the comforts of home. Those crazy settlers started to carve out a new civilization, and lots of crazy immigrants joined them -- originally from England, Scotland, and Wales, but then also from Holland and France and Germany and Ireland and Italy and China and now the entire world.</p>
    <p>I've been meaning to write up this idea at greater length, but it <a href="http://cafehayek.typepad.com/hayek/2006/04/the_entrepreneu.html">seems</a> that John D. Gartner has <a href="http://www.hypomanicedge.com/">beaten me to it</a>. I'll be reading his book soon.</p>
