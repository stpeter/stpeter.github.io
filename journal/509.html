<h2>Communalistic Meritocracy</h2>

    <p>Tim Bray, <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/03/04/LastEmperor">referring</a> to a French <a href="http://www.adullact.org/IMG/pdf/doc-157.pdf">report</a> on the open-source threat to Microsoft, quotes the authors as explaining the appeal of open-source software to developers as "je donne donc je suis" -- "I give, therefore I am" -- or, I might add (mimicking the Latin of Descartes), "dono ergo sum".</p>
    <p>Over the years I've had a hard time describing to my capitalist friends why I am so active in the open-source community (specifically <a href="https://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a>) -- when I tell them it's a communalistic meritocracy, they look at me funny. Certainly lots of folks love open-source software because it is free as in beer; after all, who likes to part with their hard-earned cash? But what's in it for those who produce all this free stuff? Those of a libertarian persuasion like to quote Heinlein's dictum TANSTAAFL ("there ain't no such thing as a free lunch"); granting the truth of that statement makes it even less comprehensible why people would volunteer to cook the lunch for others to enjoy!</p>
    <p>But people do. And not just starry-eyed communalists -- even long-time capitalists like me are active in the open-source world, often spending nights and weekends working to make things that we give away. Eric Raymond's anthropological musings have revealed that <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/ar01s06.html">open-source is a gift culture</a>, and that the members thereof compete with regard to the quality of what they share.</p>
    <p>But I think it's more than that. Speaking only for myself, I got involved with Jabber because I felt it was community to which I could productively contribute and thereby give something back. Yes, we're talking about <em>guilt</em> -- I felt more than a bit guilty about taking all that Linux goodness for free without contributing anything in return. So I started giving. Not to compete or show how smart I was, but because I wanted to join in the fun and convince other people that Jabber was cool. I wanted to help Jabber succeed (this was late 1999 and early 2000 -- we needed a lot of help back then, believe me!).</p>
    <p>Since I'm not the world's greatest coder, I started out writing documentation and eventually began documenting and developing Jabber <a href="https://www.jabber.org/protocol/">protocols</a> (in fact <a href="https://www.jabber.org/ietf/">lots</a> and <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/">lots</a> of protocols), which provide the central focus in the Jabber world. Eventually it seems that I became the de facto leader of the Jabber community, which is an odd position for a moderate anarchist to be in, since every fiber of my being resists the temptation to give orders and tell people what to do.</p>
    <p>When I started out in the open-source world as a mere Linux user (in 1998 or so), I really was a true capitalist pig of the Randian variety ("big business is America's persecuted minority" and all that). However, as I slowly became a more active contributor, I found myself living the classic Stoic metaphor of the circle of concern: Jabber people and Jabber technologies became important to me for their own sake, and their well-being became part of my well-being. Thus a corporate capitalist was transformed into an open-source communalist. It's funny how life goes sometimes...</p>
