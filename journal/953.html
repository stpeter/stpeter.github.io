<h2>Old Walt</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>

<h3>2006-05-31</h3>
    <p>Today is the birthday of Walt Whitman, who my friend Deb Ross reminds me was born on this day in 1819. I happen to think that old Walt is the greatest American poet, probably the greatest American writer, and maybe even one of the greatest Americans. I wrote about Walt in three journal entries from 2001 (<a href="92.html">1</a>, <a href="93.html">2</a>, <a href="94.html">3</a>) and ever since have been meaning to re-read his poems as well as his powerful essay <a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~Hyper/Whitman/vistas/vistas.html">Democratic Vistas</a> (which I quoted obliquely in my recent post on <a href="949.html">understanding America</a>). Until I write about Whitman again, I leave you with the poem "Old Walt" from another of my favorite American poets, Langston Hughes:</p>
    <blockquote>
<p>
Old Walt Whitman<br>
Went finding and seeking,<br>
Finding less than sought<br>
Seeking more than found,<br>
Every detail minding<br>
Of the seeking or the finding.
</p>
<p>
Pleasured equally<br>
In seeking as in finding,<br>
Each detail minding,<br>
Old Walt went seeking<br>
And finding.<br>
</p>
    </blockquote>
