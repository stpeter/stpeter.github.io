<h2>The Pool</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>

<h3>2004-06-30</h3>
    <p>Over at <a href="http://cafehayek.typepad.com/">Cafe Hayek</a>, proprietor Don Boudreaux <a href="http://cafehayek.typepad.com/hayek/2004/06/the_prosperity_.html">likens</a> the modern economy to a big pool in which prosperity is accumulated drop by drop by many small contributions:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>How is this pool filled? Mostly, small drop by small drop. Countless people line the edge of the pool, each dripping in a drop or two of additional "water" -- additional prosperity -- from time to time. Very few single drops have any noticeable effect on the prosperity level....</p>
      <p>A very few drops are large -- say, the polio vaccine, and Henry Ford's innovation for producing automobiles. But almost all drops are tiny. These tiny drops, though, together result in an enormously high level of material prosperity.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>So folks like my friend <a href="https://blog.dizzyd.com/blog/">Dizzy</a> need not <a href="https://blog.dizzyd.com/blog/index.php?p=16">worry</a> that their contributions are not producing great innovations of lasting value, which will give their lives overall purpose and direction. Sometimes it's the small stuff that counts most.</p>
