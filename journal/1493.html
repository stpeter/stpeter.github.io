<h2>Ancient Fire</h2>
<h3>2013-09-02</h3>
<p>This self-publishing stuff is fun! Over the last few months I've published both <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tao-Roark-Variations-Theme-Rand/dp/0615822959/">The Tao of Roark</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Letters-on-Happiness-ebook/dp/B00D1V4XZ8/">Letters on Happiness</a>. Recently I added another book to the list: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ancient-Fire-Translations-Peter-Saint-Andre/dp/0615848966/">Ancient Fire</a>, a collection of poems and translations that I made in the 1990s. Despite the fact that I don't claim to be more than a second- or third-rank poet, I've received positive feedback over the years about several of the poems in this collection so I figured it would be good to make them available in print and ebook formats. Next on my list: <a href="/writings/ismbook/">The Ism Book</a> (which I originally wrote in 1996 and have revised several times since then).</p>
<p>Oh, and if you enjoy any of these books, please consider writing a review on Amazon so that other folks can find them, too. Thanks. :-)</p>
