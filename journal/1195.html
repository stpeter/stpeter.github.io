<h2>The Blood-Tainted Banner</h2>
<h3>2008-01-31</h3>
<p>Many years ago I thought up these alternate words to "The Star-Spangled Banner", to be sung by anti-American fifth columnists at their political protests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
    O say, can you see, by the fire's evil light,<br>
    What we shamefully burn at the protest we're leading,<br>
    Whose red stripes and white stars symbolize, to our minds,<br>
    The imperialist reign of our white racist leaders?<br>
    And the revolution we desire to foment<br>
    Gives proof all the time that our country we hate.<br>
    O when will that blood-tainted banner cease to wave<br>
    O’er the land of the sleaze, and the home of the slave?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't expect a recording by the Michael Moore Chorale anytime soon...</p>
