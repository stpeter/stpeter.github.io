<p>Three weeks ago I had the honor of being interviewed by Sal Inglima of Boston Free Radio for his Open Readings show. We had a great time talking about the fine art of poetry translation. Sal read aloud my translation of a German poem about the eve of World War II by philosopher Walter Kaufmann and I read my translation of Sappho fragment 16 as well as two of my own poems: Ancient Fire (from the eponymous collection) and Brief Wisdom (from <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite>, my book about Friedrich Nietzsche). Enjoy!</p>
