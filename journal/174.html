<p>I just found my friend Chris Sciabarra's <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/update.htm">remembrance</a> of philosopher George Walsh, who passed away on November 8th of last year. George was a special person -- a serious philosopher who always had a twinkle in his eye. I recall that years ago George had some kind words to say about a short essay I wrote on medieval philosophy during my time at the long-defunct American Renaissance School, and that meant a great deal to me since I knew he was a real philosopher and not just some crank Randian. I would see him every few years at some Objectivist seminar (back when I still attended such events) and it was always a pleasure to be in his presence. He is missed.</p>
