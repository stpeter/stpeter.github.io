<p>Recently my alma mater, Columbia University, was back in the news because the Trump administration threatened to withhold $400 million in federal grants until the university changed some of its internal polocies. The political responses were predictable: populists were pleased about sticking it to leftist academics, faculty fulminated about threats to their intellectual freedom, the interim president lost her job over decisions she made, and a few folks quietly wondered about the wisdom of federal funding for so much educational activity and scientific research.</p>
<p>Because all that political stuff is far outside my influence and control, my reaction is more personal and philosophical: an event like this reinforces my policy of what I call self-patronage. I have always funded my intellectual and artistic endeavors through my own independent means, never through academic positions, think-tank paychecks, non-profit grants, wealthy patrons, crowdfunded donations, paid subscriptions, or anything other than the money I earned in my business career. As I see it, one canâ€™t maintain true freedom of thought - the deep foundation underlying mere freedom of speech - if someone else is footing the bill.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, those who are now surprised that a new paymaster might make new demands forgot the wisdom of an ancient saying: <em>he who pays the piper calls the tune</em>.</p>
