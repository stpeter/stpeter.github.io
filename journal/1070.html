    <p><a href="http://lukewarmtapioca.com/">Britt Selvitelle</a> and I had a good chat just now about <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a>, <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0163.html">personal eventing</a>, and the concept of <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/freeman/lifestreams.html">lifestreams</a>. Both Twitterers and Jabberites share a vision of making the Internet a more dynamic, alive, pulsating kind of place, focused less on pages and more on people and their endlessly fascinating activities. Services like Twitter and <a href="http://jaiku.com">Jaiku</a> have their finger on the pulse of what people are doing -- a kind of collective unconscious. So in their own specialized ways do services like <a href="http://last.fm/">last.fm</a> and <a href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora</a> for music, <a href="http://www.joost.com/">Joost</a> and presumably <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> for video, <a href="http://beta.plazes.com/">Plazes</a> for location, and much more. I see the need for two things to bring these many streams together into a mighty, pulsing river of real-time interaction:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Common data formats and transports to represent and share all this information.</li>
      <li>A forum for builders of such services to collaborate about how to make this happen.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Hint: I think the Jabber/XMPP community has a great deal to add to this conversation because it's the people in your buddy list who care about what you're doing, presence information provides a way to know where the information needs to go, and if every Jabber ID is a real-time eventing service then we have a way to funnel all this data through your online identity off to the people in your buddy list.</p>
    <p>Oh and BTW my Twitter and Jaiku feeds are <a href="https://twitter.com/stpeter">here</a> and <a href="http://stpeter.jaiku.com/">here</a>.</p>
