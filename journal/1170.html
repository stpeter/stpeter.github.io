<h2>This Perfect Day</h2>
<h3>2007-11-30</h3>
<p>A few days ago I read <a href="http://isbn.nu/0394448588">This Perfect Day</a> by Ira Levin (better known for "A Kiss Before Dying" and "Rosemary's Baby"). It's yet another in the 20th-century tradition of the dystopian novel, which began with Zamyatin's <em>We</em> in 1921 and continued with Huxley's <em>Brave New World</em> in 1932, Rand's <em>Anthem</em> in 1938, Orwell's <em>1984</em> in 1949, Bradbury's <em>Fahrenheit 451</em> in 1953, Nabokov's <em>Invitation to a Beheading</em> in 1965, and Levin's <em>This Perfect Day</em> in 1970 (and probably more I don't know about). In some ways I think that Levin's treatment provided more insights into the psychology of conformism and the sheer but wonderfully natural messiness of true freedom. In any case, it's well worth reading if you go in for that kind of thing. :-)</p>
