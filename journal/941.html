<h2>Once More With Feeling</h2>

    <p>So I just had a long chat with a non-Jabberite about the state of end-to-end encryption in the Jabber world. It's painful to have to explain yet again that, no, we don't have an agreed-upon technology for end-to-end encryption. Instead we have a hodgepodge of partially specified and implemented protocols:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0027.html">JEP-0027: Current Jabber OpenPGP Usage</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://xmpp.org/specs/rfc3923.html">RFC 3923: End-to-End Signing and Object Encryption for the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0116.html">JEP-0116: Encrypted Sessions</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>JEP-0027 has been implemented in a few clients because some folks have OpenPGP keys and there are <a href="http://www.cypherspace.org/openpgp/">various OpenPGP libraries</a>, but is not in wide use because, well, not many people have OpenPGP keys.</p>
    <p>RFC 3923 has not been implemented at all because Jabber developers hate it -- it really does not conform to the <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0134.html">tao of Jabber</a> and it requires a library for parsing <a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/cpim.html">CPIM</a>, yet none exist as far as I know.</p>
    <p>JEP-0116 provides intriguing features like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_forward_secrecy">perfect forward secrecy</a> and per-stanza repudiability (a la <a href="http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/">Off-the-Record Messaging</a>) but there are no libraries for it -- such libraries will have to be built from scratch, thus impeding developer acceptance.</p>
    <p>So I've started to look into a fourth option: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/">XML signatures</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlenc-core/">XML encryption</a>. These technologies have several advantages:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>They were produced by people who know a lot more about security than I do, namely the W3C's <a href="http://www.w3.org/Signature/">XML Signature WG</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Encryption/2001/">XML Encryption WG</a>
</li>
      <li>XML Signatures were published jointly by the W3C and the IETF (see <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3275.txt">RFC 3275</a>), so I think they would be more acceptable to our friends at the IETF than a homegrown solution like encrypted sessions</li>
      <li>There are <a href="http://www.w3.org/Signature/#Code">many libraries</a> for xmldsig and xmlenc, which will speed developer adoption</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The downsides of using xmldsig and xmlenc are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>They don't provide perfect forward security or repudiability as far as I can see (these are nice but are they truly necessary?)</li>
      <li>They require support for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n">Canonical XML</a> (this has elicited howls of protest from some Jabber developers in the past, but I think the objections can be overcome)</li>
      <li>In order to support signing and encryption of IQ stanzas, we'd need to relax the prohibition on multiple child elements (but, I think, only for children qualified by the http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig# and http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc# namespaces)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Further research required...</p>
