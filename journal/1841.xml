<p>Riffing on a post by Arnold Kling, who in turn was riffing on Marc Andreessen, I've been pondering the topics that various schools of thought tend to ignore. Kling was talking about politics: conservatives don't like to discuss beneficial social changes they once opposed, progressives don't like to consider anything but oppression as a cause of disparate outcomes, etc. However, we can apply the same line of thinking to philosophies. Here are a few possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aristotelians give short shrift to moral rules and behavioral policies.</li>
<li>Kantians give short shrift to character traits and the outcomes of action.</li>
<li>Utilitarians give short shrift to personal relationships and character traits.</li>
<li>Stoics give short shrift to emotions and the irreplaceable value of loved ones.</li>
<li>Epicureans give short shrift to the socio-political environment in which one lives.</li>
<li>Confucians give short shrift to spontaneity and living in the moment.</li>
<li>Taoists give short shrift to deliberation and planning for the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on. It'd be a worthwhile exercise to think this through more fully.</p>
