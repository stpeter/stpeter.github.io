<h2>Slummage</h2>

<h3>2004-06-15</h3>
    <p>It seems more and more people are realizing that <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2004/05/02#emailIsASlum">email is a slum</a>. The latest person to drink the <a href="456.html">Klue-Aid</a> is the ever-insightful Stowe Boyd. In a weblog entry on <a href="http://www.corante.com/getreal/archives/004346.html">spam and the future of email</a>, he observes:</p> 
    <blockquote>
      <p>I find it fascinating that I am asked to speak on email since I hate it so much. Perhaps that is why I get asked to speak on these panels: I think we should all transition -- as fast as possible -- to IM-like closed networks, or other media where spam just can't (easily) intrude.</p>
      <p>My prediction is that email (as we know it) will dwindle to insignificance, at least in the business context, just like postal mail has. The next generation of converged social tools -- presence-based real-time communication plus blog-based community-focused solutions -- will offer such great benefits that we will all transition to them just as fast as the vendors work out the kinks.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Two comments:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>It's not just about vendors, it's about open standards such as <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/FrontPage">ATOM</a> and <a href="https://www.jabber.org/ietf/">XMPP</a>.</li>
      <li>The move to IM is a natural progression, because people feel <a href="519.html">the need for speed</a>.</li>
    </ol>
