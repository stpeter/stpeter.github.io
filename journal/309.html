<h2>Lolling</h2>
<h3>2002-11-22</h3>
<p>The word of the week next week is "loll". Yes, I am going to attempt to take a few days off and relax. It's not easy when you're a workaholic, but I'm going to try. Maybe I'll start updating <a href="/writings/ismbook/">The Ism Book</a> (which sorely needs it), do some reading, write a bit for some of the essays I have planned, and finish setting "Freedom's Plow" to music (there's really just this brief middle section that I need to work on). But I'm going to try not to log into Jabber, check my mail, and the like. We'll see if I succeed...</p>
