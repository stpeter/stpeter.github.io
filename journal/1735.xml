<p>In a recent post entitled "How a Business Wins", Arnold Kling made the following observation:</p>
<blockquote>Building a business, especially an innovative business in a complex environment, requires many, many decisions. You can be lucky with any one decision, but to get enough decisions right to make the business work takes much more than luck.</blockquote>
<p>As hinted in my post "Compounding Wisdom" two years ago, this insight applies to more than just business. Your health, your marriage, your friendships, your financial stability, your character - long-term success in each of these requires many decisions over the course of many years.</p>
<p>The fundamental principle involved was identified by Aristotle 2400 years ago: we are what we habitually do. Therefore it's crucial to develop a consistent <em>practice</em> of good decision-making, which is what Aristotle called practical wisdom (in ancient Greek, φρόνησις). I've been giving a lot of thought to this topic of late and will have more to say about it in the coming weeks.</p>
