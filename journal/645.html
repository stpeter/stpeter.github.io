    <p>OK, I need to start <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,65237,00.html">podcasting</a>. For those who don't know, podcasting is a kind of <a href="http://garage.docsearls.com/node/view/462">do-it-yourself radio</a> and <a href="http://www.podcasting.net/">lots of folks are doing it</a> because it's <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/5843952395227141/">easy</a> and it's a <a href="http://www.artsjournal.com/artfulmanager/92660.php">great way to reach people</a>. I'll have plenty of audio content to offer once I get a little more recording equipment, which I hope will happen Real Soon Now [tm]. Like what? Well, there's all the <a href="/music/">music</a> I've written over the years (recording it will keep me engaged for quite a while), as well as spoken versions of my <a href="http://www.saint-andre.com/poems/fire/">poems</a>. Not sure what I'll do after I'm finished with my music and poetry, but I'm sure I'll think of something. :-)</p>
