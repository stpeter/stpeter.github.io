<h2>Not ASIN</h2>

<h3>2005-03-28</h3>
    <p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,67034,00.html">This article</a> in Wired magazine has finally pushed me to stop linking to Amazon.com when I refer to books in my blog. Sure, it's nice to get a small credit once in a while for referrals (which I invariably use to buy gifts for people I know), but I'm simply not comfortable linking to Amazon any longer. Instead, I'm now going to link to <a href="http://isbn.nu/">isbn.nu</a>, which provides a really cool price comparison service based on a book's <a href="http://www.isbn.org/">ISBN number</a>. An extra benefit is that URIs at isbn.nu are really easy to construct and remember (and, I hope, more stable): they are just http://isbn.nu/foo as opposed to those Amazon URLs of the form http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/foo/ (which they probably won't change, but how do I know that, and what the heck is an ASIN anyway?). The <a href="http://www.isbn.org/standards/home/isbn/international/html/usm12.htm">structure of ISBN numbers</a> has been standardized, as has a <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3187.txt">URN scheme</a> for ISBNs, so I'm also going to follow <a href="http://www.benmeadowcroft.com/webdev/articles/urns-and-citations/">Ben Meadowcroft's lead</a> by including the 'cite' attribute whenever I quote at length from a book, where the value of that attribute will point to the URN for that book (i.e., "urn:isbn:isbn-number").</p>
    <p>Standards good.</p>
