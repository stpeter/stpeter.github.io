    <p>Earlier this month I <a href="764.html">noticed</a> the existence of Byzantine Catholics. Recently I found another relatively obscure Christian sect: Anglican Catholics. There's an Anglican Catholic church not far from my house in Denver, so naturally I decided to investigate. According to <a href="http://www.dpsw.org/whatis.htm">this page</a>, the Anglican Catholics were originally conservative or orthodox American Anglicans who split off from the Episcopal Church over changes in policy such as admittance of women to holy orders, abandonment of the Book of Common Prayer, and acceptance of abortion, euthanasia, and homosexuality. (In fact, the rector of Saint Mary's in Denver was the first bishop of the Anglican Catholics.) So many Christian churches, so little time. ;-)</p>
