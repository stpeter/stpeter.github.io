<h2>Powerless</h2>

<p>Several friends I've talked with recently have expressed despair over the results of the recent U.S. elections, disbelief over Donald Trump's picks for cabinet roles, even a desire to move to Canada or Europe - plus a kind of wonder that I'm able to maintain my equanimity in what they see as a dire situation. In case it might prove helpful to other folks, I'll try to describe my mindset.</p>
<p>First, I tend not to catastrophize because it seems to me that human beings have a nearly endless capacity for muddling through, adjusting to new circumstances, counteracting overreach, etc.</p>
<p>Second, I doubt that we are precisely situated at the crossroads of history or that we are facing an unprecedented Emergency Disaster Crisis of epic proportions. Let's not overstate our own importance. (And yes, I do hear the cries of "this time it really is different!")</p>
<p>Third, I've read enough about American history to understand that we have always had many strands of political thought in this country, and that out of these many strands a stronger (if always somewhat fractious) union has been weaved over the centuries. E Pluribus Unum.</p>
<p>Fourth, representative democracy in America (despite its faults and our inability so far to fully live up to our founding ideals) has existed for 400 years, at every level of government: one nation, 50 states, 3000+ counties, tens of thousands of cities and towns with their councils and boards and all the rest. I believe this culture of self-governance is more robust than some people fear.</p>
<p>Fifth and finally, I recognize that I have absolutely no power or influence over the ship of state. That is certainly the case at the national level: I am only one of ~340,000,000 people in the USA, I have neither sought nor gained any role in government or politics, I don't have the ear of any influential people, I'm not a so-called public intellectual, etc. The same is true here in Colorado (where I'm only one of ~6,000,000 people), in Douglas County (where I'm only one of ~400,000 people), etc. In my neighborhood of ~200 households I do run our website and serve on the board of our civic association, so here I'm able to have something of a positive impact, but in general I'm just as powerless as almost everyone else in this country.</p>
<p>The difference, perhaps, is this: I accept that I'm powerless. Over the years, I have tried to rid myself of political delusions. I don't see myself as a member of Team Blue or Team Red or any other team, because unless you're especially active in retail politics (which I'm not) then you're not really a member of a team - you're merely rooting from a seat in the bleachers. I don't kid myself that my "one small voice" of a weblog is a soapbox of any significance. I don't believe, against all evidence to the contrary, that my political opinions matter to anyone but me, or that expressing them will be anything but a source of frustration to myself and annoyance to others. And so on.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, understanding and accepting that I'm powerless is, if not exactly empowering, at least liberating. For all I know, the day-to-day machinations of powerful people in Washington, D.C. or my state capitol might as well be happening in a parallel universe. Yes, journalists and pundits have an unwelcome habit of reporting and commenting on this parallel universe as if it were the most important thing in the world, but for the most part I can ignore them and their delusions of grandeur, too.</p>
<p>What I'm left with are the aspects of life that are somewhat within my span of influence and control: my family, friendships, neighborhood, projects, activities, etc. That's quite enough to focus on without fretting about the things I cannot change.</p>
<p>Naturally, what works for me won't necessarily work for you. YMMV.</p>
