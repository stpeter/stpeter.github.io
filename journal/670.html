<h2>It's the Liberty, Stupid!</h2>
<h3>2005-01-31</h3>
    <p>Speaking of <a href="http://www.wired.com/">Wired</a>, a while back they published an article on <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,66264,00.html">technology and the Democrats</a>, which makes it plain that the Democratic Party is studiously avoiding the big reason for their lack of success: they're more interested in rearranging the technological and fundraising deck chairs than in <a href="666.html">aligning their philosophies and policies with the core American tradition of freedom and liberty</a>. If this keeps up, don't expect Hillary to go far in '08.</p>
