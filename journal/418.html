<h2>One Small Voice</h2>
<h3>2003-08-31</h3>
<p>Since I <a href="74.html">launched this weblog</a>, its title has been the same as the nickname I use on <a href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a>: "stpeter". After two years, I've decided to finally give it an official name. The name I've chosen is "one small voice", which is in part an ironic reference to Ellsworth Toohey's <em>New York Banner</em> column in Ayn Rand's novel <cite>The Fountainhead</cite>, and in part a serious attempt to capture the fact that I speak only for myself, as well as to honor the most important minority of all: the individual. It's all about <a href="http://isbn.nu/034541005X">the power of one</a>.</p>
