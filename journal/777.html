<h2>Hegemonists</h2>
<h3>2005-06-24</h3>
    <p>I've been saying privately for a while that Google is going to be the next Microsoft -- or, at least, that they're going to be perceived that way. Adam Penenberg <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,67982,00.html">certainly thinks so</a>. Personally I have my doubts, but just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you. ;-)</p>
    <p>(Penenberg also says that Google's name derives from "googol", but I still think it's a contraction of <a href="352.html">go ogle</a>. ;-)</p>
