<h2>Philosophy and Grief</h2>

<p>Grieving is one of the characteristic activities of human beings. Although it seems that some other species (e.g., members of the corvid family) experience sorrow, grief is a more complex phenomenon. Recently I read a fine book on the topic by Michael Cholbi, entitled <cite>Grief: A Philosophical Guide</cite>. Here are the essentials of what I gleaned.</p>
<p>To begin, we must understand that grief is not an emotion but an activity. Yes, grieving can involve a wide range of emotional reactions: sorrow of course, but also anxiety, guilt, anger, even joy (as Epicurus said: "Sweet is the memory of a dead friend."). But grieving also includes mental states such as confusion and perplexity, as well as mental activities such as deliberation and reflection.</p>
<p>The grounding for this intellectual component is the fact that any significant personal relationship entails a conception of what someone means to you - and that kind of meaning is bound up with your identity, your social role (e.g., within a family), indeed your entire conception of what it means to be human.</p>
<p>Cholbi makes a twofold argument. First, when someone close to you dies (or leaves you or otherwise disappears from your life), the relationship - formed of memories, expectations, longings, commitments, characteristic activities, and so on - is still there, but vastly changed. Second, because of the aforementioned ties to personal identity and practical meaning, coming to understand those changes is a process of gaining greater self-knowledge and thus represents a philosophical achievement.</p>
<p>Perhaps Emily Dickinson summed it up best:</p>
<blockquote>
There is a finished feeling<br>
Experienced at Graves -<br>
A leisure of the Future -<br>
A Wilderness of Size.
<br><br>
By Death's bold Exhibition<br>
Preciser what we are<br>
And the Eternal function<br>
Enabled to infer.
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, it's worth noting that grief was actively discouraged by most of the ancient philosophers, including Socrates, the Stoics, Chuang Tzu, and the Buddha; two notable exceptions were Aristotle and Confucius.</p>
