<h2>Capitalism is Dead</h2>

<h3>2006-12-03</h3>
    <p>Some folks wonder why I cart my own laptop around rather than, say, accepting a computer from <a href="http://www.jabber.com/">my employer</a>. The short answer is that I prefer to own my means of production. Indeed, owning your means of production is just about the most anti-Marxist thing you can do. In <a href="http://www.anglospherechallenge.com/">The Anglosphere Challenge</a>, James Bennett explains why (pp. 48-49):</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>[W]hen the falling price of computers crossed the point where the average programmer could affort to own a computer capable of producing the code from which he typically earned his living ... for the first time since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the ownership of the most critical tool of production in the most critical industry of the world's leading economy was readily affordable by the individual worker. Throughout the first three decades of the Information Age, the individual worker was still dependent on his employer for his means of production, just as any textile worker in Manchester or Lawrence was in 1840. Suddenly, this changed. Now, it is as if a steelworker could afford his own blast furnace or rolling mill, an automobile worker his own assembly line. By strict Marxist definitions, capitalism ended some time in the early 1990s.</p>
