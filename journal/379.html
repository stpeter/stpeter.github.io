<h2>Consolidated Government</h2>
<h3>2003-05-09</h3>
<p>Jefferson was deeply in favor of keeping all power as localized as possible, and well understood the dangers of centralized government. For example, in a letter to Justice William Johnson (Oct. 27, 1822), he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p> What do you think of the state of parties at this time? An opinion prevails that there is no longer any distinction, that the republicans &amp; Federalists are compleatly amalgamated but it is not so. The amalgamation is of name only, not of principle. All indeed call themselves by the name of Republicans, because that of Federalists was extinguished in the battle of New Orleans. But the truth is that finding that monarchy is a desperate wish in this country, they rally to the point which they think next best, a consolidated government. Their aim is now therefore to break down the rights reserved by the constitution to the states as a bulwark against that consolidation, the fear of which produced the whole of the opposition to the constitution at it's birth. Hence new Republicans in Congress, preaching the doctrines of the old Federalists, and the new nick-names of Ultras and Radicals. But I trust they will fail under the new, as the old name, and that the friends of the real constitution and union will prevail against consolidation, as they have done against monarchism. I scarcely know myself which is most to be deprecated, a consolidation, or dissolution of the states. The horrors of both are beyond the reach of human foresight.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a later missive to Justice Johnson (June 12, 1823), he wrote more on the subject:</p>
<blockquote><p> I have stated above, that the original objects of the federalists were, 1st, to warp our government more to the form and principles of monarchy, and, 2d, to weaken the barriers of the State governments as coordinate powers. In the first they have been so completely foiled by the universal spirit of the nation, that they have abandoned the enterprise, shrunk from the odium of their old appellation, taken to themselves a participation of ours, and under the pseudo-republican mask, are now aiming at their second object, and strengthened by unsuspecting or apostate recruits from our ranks, are advancing fast towards an ascendancy. I have been blamed for saying, that a prevalence of the doctrines of consolidation would one day call for reformation or revolution. I answer by asking if a single State of the Union would have agreed to the constitution, had it given all powers to the General Government? If the whole opposition to it did not proceed from the jealousy and fear of every State, of being subjected to the other States in matters merely its own? And if there is any reason to believe the States more disposed now than then, to acquiesce in this general surrender of all their rights and powers to a consolidated government, one and undivided?</p></blockquote>
<p>Jefferson maintains that the Federalists were closet monarchists, and that failing that they were in favor of consolidated, centralized government. America has steadfastly resisted monarchy, but it has done less well with regard to consolidated government. When something as localized as teaching and learning has a central authority (in the form of the Federal Department of Education), you know we're in trouble. Is it even possible now to reclaim local control?</p>
