<p>
Her sands have run; her thread has reached its end.<br/>
The woman whom I singled out to stride<br/>
With me through time, together at my side,<br/>
Is wife no more, nor life, nor soul, nor friend.
</p>
<p>
I joyed with her in every hour through years<br/>
Of wedded bliss; there was no cause to part.<br/>
Now I can’t fill the void within my heart;<br/>
My soul must seek a way through all its tears.
</p>
<p>
She was my earth, my moon, my star, my sun;<br/>
I’ve lost my ground, my tide, my guide, my light;<br/>
The future seems no day but only night.<br/>
Her thread has reached its end; her sands have run.
