<h2>TJ Again</h2>

<h3>2003-04-13</h3>
<p>Today is Thomas Jefferson's birthday (he's only 260 years young!). Thanks to <a href="https://www.clairewolfe.com/">Claire Wolfe</a> I just found a page that proclaims old TJ as the <a href="http://www.charlescurley.com/Jefferson.html">patron saint of the Internet</a>. I'll go along with that (despite how far wrong the patent system has gone -- I don't think we can blame TJ for that).</p>
<p>A while back I was wont to offer regular quotes from Victor Hugo. I think perhaps I'll start doing that with Thomas Jefferson. We sure could use his wisdom these days...</p>
