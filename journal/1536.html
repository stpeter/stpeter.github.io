<h2>RFC 7649: The Jabber Scribe Role at IETF Meetings</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>

<h3>2015-09-23</h3>
<p>During its thrice-yearly meetings, the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> makes fairly heavy use of chatrooms powered by Jabber/XMPP technologies (which only makes sense because XMPP was standardized by the IETF). These chatrooms are used mainly as a way for remote participants to send comments to the physical meeting room. Thus arises the need for what we call "Jabber scribes" - folks at the meeting who volunteer to relay comments from the chatroom at the microphone and otherwise help to improve the experience for remote participants. Those who volunteer for this role often wonder if there are some guidelines they can follow, so Dan York and I have helpfully obliged by writing <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7649/">RFC 7649</a>. Happy scribing!</p>
