<h2>Fundamental Affirmation</h2>

<p>For several years now I've been working on a set of transcriptions for solo electric bass of songs by the progressive rock band <a href="http://yesworld.com/">Yes</a>, provisionally entitled <a href="/music/yes/">Fundamental Affirmation</a>. In his book <cite>Music of Yes</cite>, <a href="http://las.depaul.edu/philosophy/people/faculty/bill_martin.asp">Bill Martin</a> calls such transcriptions "Squire Variations" in honor of <a href="http://www.chrissquire.com/">Chris Squire</a>, co-founder and longtime bassist of Yes. My take is perhaps not quite what Martin had in mind, because although Squire's bass lines feature prominently in my arrangements I also weave in the melodies and even at time the guitar and keyboard parts (to some extent as a way to do justice to the polycentric nature of the Yes music, which Martin himself stresses in his book).</p>
<p>Given my love for Yes, this has been a rewarding and enjoyable project. So far I've completed transcriptions of songs from four of the six albums in what Martin calls the "main sequence" of Yes music:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"To Be Over" from <cite>Relayer</cite>
</li>
  <li>"South Side of the Sky" from <cite>Fragile</cite>
</li>
  <li>"Turn of the Century" from <cite>Going for the One</cite>
</li>
  <li>"A Venture" from <cite>The Yes Album</cite>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I long thought that I'd try to make an arrangement of "Heart of the Sunrise" from <cite>Fragile</cite>, but now I'm not so sure -- I've been working on that one lately and somehow the arrangement isn't coming together. Although I'll keep at the task for a while longer, I might abandon it in favor of the largest transcription of them all: "Close to the Edge", the title song of Yes's 1972 album and what I consider to be the perfection of their art. (For a while there I was toying with the idea of making a suite based on their 1973 release <cite>Tales from Topographic Oceans</cite>, but that was something like making a classical guitar transcription of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony!)</p>
<p>Speaking of classical guitar, somewhat crazily I'm crafting these arrangements on the bottom four strings of my nylon string guitar, since I don't currently own an electric bass. However, I have my eye on a somewhat exotic <a href="http://www.veilletteguitars.com/electric_bass_nylon.shtml">nylon string electric bass</a> made by luthier Joe Veillette, because its sound really fits what I have in mind for this project. When I finally make some rough recordings, I'll be sure to post them online!</p>
