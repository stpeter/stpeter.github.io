<h2>A Brief Prediction</h2>

<h3>2008-12-02</h3>
<p>For the original bailout of the financial industry back in October, the U.S. Congress made a show of voting it down, supposedly in response to the overwhelming opposition of the citizenry, then passed it anyway (after allowing favored politicians in close re-election races an opportunity to vote "no" the first time). I predict that the same thing will happen with the bailout of the American auto manufacturers: the Congress told the corporate welfare kings from Detroit to take a hike a few weeks back, but today I'm sure they'll say "oh you came back with a wonderful plan, here's 50 billion dollars" (or whatever).</p>
<p> Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.</p>
