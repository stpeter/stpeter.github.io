<h2>Czech Again</h2>
<h3>2002-06-27</h3>
<p>I forgot to mention that the most enchanting experience I had in the enchanted city of Prague recently was a visit to <a href="http://www.ctg.cz/food_drink/rychta/fontan_e.htm">Krizik's Fountain</a>, a huge fountain (actually a set of fountains) where the water jets and lights are "choreographed" to move in time and sympathy with the music. I saw something like this once in Seattle with my friend Scott, but this fountain was much bigger and quite impressive, indeed mesmerizing. Plus the music was Dvorak's New World Symphony, which is one of my favorites! The fountain was originally built by František Křižík, a prolific engineer and inventor who provided the first electrification in Prague, among other things. (I hope you're using a well-behaved web browser that can render those cool Czech characters. I found them <a href="http://www.tela.bc.ca/tads/authoring/multimedia-tads-docs/latin2.htm">here</a>. You're not expected to be able to pronounce them, though!)</p>
