<p>Will Wilkinson has posted some <a href="http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/2001_12_16_archive.html#7964035">beautiful thoughts</a> in his weblog about creating a life of meaning in a free society. Here's an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>There's no denying that it's hard making something of your life. And there's no denying that there is comfort, even meaning, in tradition and in assigned roles. But there is no universal formula for meaning. And readymade visions may leave you cold, or oppressed. Our freedom and wealth is beautiful and good. And, yes, the possibilities of freedom and wealth are daunting. But therein lies much of the beauty and goodness. We are now at a point in history when our wealth and freedom make it possible to treat life as art. We are at liberty to recombine the found elements of our culture and shape our days into something not only novel, but beautiful and true.</p></blockquote>
