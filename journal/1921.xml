<p>Not long ago I ran across a wonderful quote from Frédéric Chopin:</p>
<blockquote>Simplicity is the final achievement. After one has played a vast quantity of notes and more notes, it is simplicity that emerges as the crowning reward of art.</blockquote>
<p>Ironically, I tend to associate Chopin's music with "a vast quantity of notes"; to find simplicity, I would seek out, say, the music of Erik Satie, whose Trois Gymnopédies I've been re-learning on guitar of late.</p>
<p>Or, as is written in chapter 56 of the Tao Te Ching:</p>
<blockquote>
Those who know don't say<br/>
Those who say don't know
</blockquote>
<p>And, of course, Thoreau, who urged us to "Simplify, simplify."</p>
<p>Contemplating the matter makes me want to contemplate more and write less...</p>
