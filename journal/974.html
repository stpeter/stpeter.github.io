<h2>Raptor Rescue</h2>
<h3>2006-07-03</h3>
<p>There's a 120-year-old cottonwood tree in my front yard, which this year is home to a family of <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Coopers_Hawk_dtl.html">Cooper's Hawks</a>. Last night around 8:00, one of the nestlings either fell out of the nest or, I think, was forced out by the parent hawks. This morning the nestling was on our porch and seemingly unable to fly, so we called around and located some volunteers who could collect the young hawk and take it to the <a href="http://www.birds-of-prey.org/">Birds of Prey Foundation</a>, where we hope it is being well take care of. Thanks to volunteers Ken and Theresa from Northglenn, Colorado, and to the folks at the Birds of Prey Foundation, it seems that the raptor rescue was a success.</p>
