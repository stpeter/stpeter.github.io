<h2>Firewall Not So Great?</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>
</h3>
<h3>2006-01-18</h3>
    <p>The news media is agog over reports that the Chinese authorities routinely block access to restricted websites and chatrooms, filter out bad words like "freedom" and "democracy", and so on (with Microsoft, Yahoo, AOL, Cisco, Google, and other big American companies lending a helping hand). The funny thing is that I receive nice emails from people in China about how much they enjoy my blog, and you <em>know</em> that I am far, far from being politically correct (heck, I sometimes wonder if the U.S. government will censor me, let alone the Chinese government). So I have to wonder about the effectiveness of the great firewall of China...</p>
