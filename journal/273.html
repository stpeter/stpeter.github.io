<h2>Poetic Justice</h2>

<h3>2002-07-29</h3>
<p>The other day John Enright sent me some poems, so this evening I <a href="http://monadnock.net/poems/enright.html">posted them</a> at the website of my literary webzine. John was the first person to publish any of my poems back in the pages of the long-defunct magazine <cite>Nomos</cite>, and he's one of my very favorite poets, so it's only just that I publish his work. Perhaps someday (after I finish my Jabber book!) I'll print a book of John's poems. But that's for someday, not today or the near future....</p>
