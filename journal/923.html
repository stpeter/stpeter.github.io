<h2>Ten Years</h2>

    <p>It seems I forgot to mention that my website recently experienced its tenth anniversary. Back in January of 1996, I started converting <a href="/writings/ismbook/">The Ism Book</a> and some of my essays to HTML, and the first, ultra-basic version of my website went live in February or March of that year. Although I had been active on various email discussion lists since 1993 (yes, I'm a relative latecomer to the Internet), I was still a clueless newbie when it came to things like HTML (which I probably edited in MS Word!) and FTP (which I recall confused me to no end at first). That sure seems like a long time ago now, but we've all got to start somewhere...</p>
