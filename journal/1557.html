<h2>Ethics and Politics Revisited</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>
</h3>
<h3>2016-10-14</h3>
<p>The continuing disclosure of disgraceful conduct (past and present) by the atrocious candidates nominated for President by both the Democrats and the Republicans has led me to reflect further on the relationship between <a href="1547.html">ethics and politics</a>. In particular, if I care about character and ethical principles then it seems incumbent upon me to cast my vote for the candidate with the greatest personal integrity. Not the lesser of two evils - why would align myself with evil? - but the most reasonable, honest, principled person on the ballot. This year for President that person is <a href="https://www.johnsonweld.com/">Gary Johnson</a>. He also happens to be a moderate libertarian, which is how I've described myself for a number of years. If I can find the time over the next few weeks, I will write in more depth about the importance of a moderate libertarian approach to the future of American politics.</p>
