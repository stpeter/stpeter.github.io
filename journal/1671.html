<h2>Blended Vision</h2>

<p>The other day I went to see the eye doctor, who told me I have blended vision: one of my eyes is farsighted and the other is nearsighted, but they function well together. Quite a fitting analogy for what Pierre Hadot called philosophy as the love and practice of wisdom. We tend to think of philosophy as hopelessly abstract, but if it is in part a <em>practice</em> then it focuses not only on what is far but also on what is near. One of the poems in my book <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite> tries to capture this insight:</p>
<p>FAR AND NEAR</p>
<p>
The hand of those who legislate<br>
Directs you to what's far away:<br>
Salvation, science, riches, state,<br>
The things that by convention pay.
</p>
<p>
Instead consider what is near<br>
To be your weightiest concern<br>
And focus your attention here:<br>
Apply your powers and discern
</p>
<p>
What benefits you in the way<br>
You interact with foe and friend,<br>
The best division of the day,<br>
Reflection on the time you spend
</p>
<p>
In work and leisure, art and play,<br>
In nature and society,<br>
In what command and what obey,<br>
In courage and propriety.
</p>
<p>
The body has its wisdom, too:<br>
Philosophy applies to sleep,<br>
To what you eat, to what you do<br>
In daily life - this too is deep
</p>
<p>
And subject to a higher code<br>
Of individuality.<br>
By following your natural mode,<br>
You ground your own reality.
