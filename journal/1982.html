<h2>AI and I</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>

<h3>2025-08-21</h3>
<p>With all the Sturm und Drang about so-called artificial intelligence right now, I'd like to make it clear that I don't use these technologies. For me, the primary consideration is not that AI will, on balance, degrade humanity's already weakened ability to engage in independent thinking and humane interaction (although I think evidence is mounting that this will be the case). No, I simply find these technologies <em>uninteresting</em>.</p>
<p>My aspiration in life is to become an excellent human being and to find personal fulfillment: doing right by the people I care about, creating some beautiful works of art, and achieving some measure of sagacity. Based on a few experiments I undertook last year and on my understanding of how large language models work, AI has no role to play in these lifelong pursuits of mine.</p>
<p>I recognize that some people use AI to manage their relationships and work more productively on their projects; perhaps someday (even someday relatively soon) most people in advanced societies will do the same. But I'm not some people or most people: I am myself. And I'm committed to, devoted to, in love with the sheer <em>activities</em> of living: not the product but the process, not the answers but the quest, not the destination but the way.</p>
<p>All of my books, poems, musical compositions, and journal entries are, and will remain, 100% natural and organic - no artificial intelligence added.</p>
