<p>More and more, I come to the conclusion that the USA is simply not a sustainable country. Now that America has been somewhat thickly settled for a few hundred years, it makes sense to divide the place up in a more natural way. A rough approximation might yield five regions: the Pacific States of America, Mountain States of America, Central States of America, Southern States of America, and Eastern States of America. A more nuanced approach might yield quite a few more (for example, it seems to me that the folks in northern New England don't necessarily want to have much to do with the big cities of the Eastern Seaboard, folks in Texas already have a fairly strong identity that isn't closely tied to places north and east of there, etc.). Personally, I think I'd choose Wymontaho -- the combination of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. :)</p>
