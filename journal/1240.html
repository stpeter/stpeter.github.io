<h2>Consent Withheld</h2>
<h3>2008-06-16</h3>
<p>As <a href="1233.html">noted</a>, I've been pondering how, or even whether, to vote in the American elections this fall. I've considered writing in <a href="http://www.nota.org/">none of the above</a>, but that makes it sound as if I'm merely unsatisfied with the offered choices and would happily indicate a positive preference if only someone else were running. Yet I don't think any politicians will make a difference, because America's problems are so deeply systemic.</p>
<p>I've also considered not voting at all, but that doesn't make it clear why I'm not voting. Was I just not feeling well on Election Day? Did I have a busy day at the office? Was I travelling? Who knows? I'd be implicitly counted as giving my consent to this ever-more-corrupt system we live in. And I don't want to be implicitly counted in favor -- I want to withhold my consent in as explicit a manner as possible.</p>
<p>So I'm thinking that instead of writing "none of the above", I'll write "consent withheld" on my ballot. Sure, it will count as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoilt_vote">spoiled vote</a>, but perhaps that's a <a href="http://spoilballot.blogspot.com/2008/05/spoiled-ballot-archive.html">good thing</a>. I haven't yet seen the mail-in ballot here in Colorado, but once I do I'll figure out the best way to withhold my consent, scan in the results, and post my ballot online before sending it in to those who count the votes.</p>
<p>Just say no to politics!</p>
