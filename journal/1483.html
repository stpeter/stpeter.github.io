<h2>RFC 6869: vCard Devices</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>
</h3>
<h3>2013-02-08</h3>
<p>Today the RFC Editor published <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6869.txt">RFC 6869</a>, which defines a new kind of vCard for devices. This document, which I co-authored with two of my colleagues at Cisco, complements <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6473.txt">RFC 6473</a>. During the working group discussions that led to publication of RFC 6473, we decided to split software applications from hardware devices in the general category of things (as opposed to people, locations, groups, and organizations, which are defined in the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6350.txt">core vCard spec</a>). We considered "thing" too generic, but we also didn't want to begin the endless task of defining a detailed taxonomy of things, thus the middle ground of defining devices and applications to start with. We can always add more kinds if needed. :-)</p>
