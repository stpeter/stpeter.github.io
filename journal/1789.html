<h2>More Humanity</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>

<h3>2022-06-17</h3>
<p>The other day I observed that, in the balance between mindlessly using technology and deliberately honoring people's humanity (including my own), I tilt toward more humanity. But how does that cash out in everyday life?</p>
<p>In case it might prove helpful to readers, I figured I'd describe some of my personal policies and practices in relation to digital technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't use Facebook. To keep in touch with friends and family, I see them in person or talk with them via phone (preferred) or video.</li>
<li>In between visits and calls, I communicate via email or text - indeed, I'd still write physical letters but I haven't found anyone who wants to do that anymore!</li>
<li>I don't use Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, etc.</li>
<li>Although I do still have a Twitter account, I log into it only a few times a year.</li>
<li>I visit YouTube only on occasion (e.g., to watch those helpful how-to videos or give an initial listen to hard-to-find music), and only in a private browsing window without logging into Google. I never click any of the videos that YouTube's algorithms recommend.</li>
<li>Speaking of Google, although I have a Google account, I log into it only when absolutely necessary and only in Google Chrome (which is not my everyday browser). Otherwise I use DuckDuckGo for search, Fastmail for email, Jitsi for video chat, and Brave or Firefox for browsing.</li>
<li>I have a smartphone, but I've installed only a bare minimum of apps on it.</li>
<li>On both my phone and my computer, I have popup notifications and "badges" (e.g., unread message counts) disabled.</li>
<li>I don't play any phone or computer games.</li>
<li>I have my phone interface set to greyscale so that the garish colors of the icons don't draw me in. For reading purposes, I use a mobile browser (Firefox in private browsing mode) in which I have images disabled.</li>
<li>I try to use my phone as little as possible, and then mostly for reading, a bit of texting with the few people who know my phone number, and necessary workflows (e.g., two-factor authentication).</li>
<li>Although I read news headlines once a day (usually at wsj.com or text.npr.org), I don't read the actual news stories. Other than that, I avoid news websites (see above on algorithmic recommendations).</li>
<li>In preference to new websites, once or twice a week I make a scan of analytical articles at blogs and online magazines that I've found insightful, and I selectively read perhaps 20% of the articles.</li>
<li>In preference to blogs and magazines, I read books. I sometimes read old public-domain books online after I have posted them at my monadnock.net website, but for other books I don't use an e-reader; instead, I check physical books out of the library, often sourced via interlibrary loan because most of the books I read are less popular works of philosophy, history, science, and poetry. If a book I've taken out of the library seems especially useful for one of my research projects, I buy it used through bookfinder.com and mark it up while reading.</li>
</ul>
<p>To generalize, here are ten principles that I try to put into practice:</p>
<ol>
<li>Focus on my most important projects and relationships.</li>
<li>Follow my own priorities and interests, not what's trending or recommended.</li>
<li>Avoid technologies that can manipulate me through individualized profiling and algorithmic "personalization".</li>
<li>Eliminate distractions.</li>
<li>Prefer reading text over viewing images and videos.</li>
<li>Prefer in-person interactions over technologically-mediated interactions.</li>
<li>Prefer old technologies over new technologies.</li>
<li>Prefer slow technologies over fast technologies.</li>
<li>Prefer knowledge over information.</li>
<li>Prefer wisdom over knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<p>As I live in accordance with these principles, I'll continue to reflect on them and hone them further.</p>
