<h2>CC0</h2>
<h3>2011-08-18</h3>
<p>Over lunch today I finally made time to read up on the Creative Commons <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_FAQ">CC0 waiver</a> and how it differs from the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/PDM_FAQ">public domain mark</a>. In essence, CC0 is a universal waiver of economic rights (traditional copyright, but in some jurisdictions not <a href="http://www.rbs2.com/moral.htm">moral rights</a>) in a work you have created, whereas PD is a mark that identifies an existing work as in the public domain. </p>
<p>Therefore I have decided to use CC0 for my blog and other writings, not PD. (Why not just use the public domain mark? I haven't had time to research it fully, but apparently you can't just place something into the public domain in some jurisdictions; unlike PD, the CC0 waiver has a fallback license to handle such cases.)</p>
