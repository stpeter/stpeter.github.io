<h2>Renaissance</h2>

<p>I've been listening to the music of Renaissance a lot lately. No, not the music of <em>the</em> Renaissance, but the music of the English progressive folk-rock band Renaissance. Funny thing is, Rob (Jabber Inc.'s CEO) stopped by my desk about an hour ago and noticed my Renaissance CDs -- it turns out he's a big Renaissance fan, too! They're pretty obscure, so that's quite a coincidence.</p>
<p>So what kind of music is this? Long-time readers of this weblog know that I'm a big <a href="http://www.yesworld.com/">Yes</a> fan, so it's easiest for me to compare the two than to talk about Renaissance in isolation. First off, I know less about Renaissance because I'm not quite as a big a fan of theirs and I possess only the two volumes of their "greatest hits" (entitled <cite>Tales of 1001 Nights</cite>). Whereas Yes is perhaps the best-known progressive rock band, Renaissance's music is more like progressive folk. Their lyrics, almost all of which were written by a poet who was not a member of the band, are more openly-understandable than those of Yes. In addition, they featured a symphony orchestra on a number of their recordings, whereas Yes orchestrated their pieces with only the standard rock instruments (although some of those keyboards almost sound like a string orchestra). Supposedly Renaissance was influenced quite strongly by Russian music, and one of their songs is even entitled "Mother Russia" (it's about Solzhenitsyn). Personally I think that the music of Renaissance is a little more simple than that of Yes. Plus the fact that Renaissance has a woman vocalist (the incredible Annie Haslam) gives them a different sound. And their music is more piano-focused than that of Yes. But if you ask me, both bands are amazing! Especially this live version of <a href="http://www.enteract.com/~nlights/lib/lyrics/ashes.htm#ASHES">Ashes are Burning</a> that I'm listening to right now (yes, it clocks in at 23:47!).</p>
