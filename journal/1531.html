<h2>Two More Nietzschean Poems</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>
</h3>
<h3>2015-06-11</h3>
<p>Although my philosophical focus right now is on Thoreau, I'm also thinking once in a while about <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite> (a cycle of poems providing a positive interpretation of Nietzsche's ethics). Here are drafts of two more poems that might make the cut. As can be seen, these are related to my previous poem <a href="1507.html">Eternal Recurrence</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Amor Fati</strong><br>
<p>
Whatever might unfold for me<br>
Is not spun out by scheming Fates;<br>
Instead it's simple destiny,<br>
A line of life that time creates.
<br><br>
It's natural that I love this line,<br>
Despite its pains and hurried pace;<br>
Because the steps I make are mine,<br>
I take pride in their style and grace.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wrote the first stanza of that one a month or two ago. As I was waking up this morning, the following poem (<cite>Spiral</cite>) came to me quite quickly, and then I went back and worked out a second stanza to <cite>Amor Fati</cite>. As always, these are provisional and might not survive the editor's pen.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Spiral</strong><br>
<p>
Eternal recurrence of the same<br>
Sounds like a circle I can't escape,<br>
The endless march of a lowly ant<br>
On a moebius strip of grinding fate. 
<br><br>
And yet the notion spurs me on<br>
To fly and soar while I have the chance,<br>
To make my life a thing of gold<br>
That shines out over time and space. 
</p>
