<p>My propositions serve as elucidations in the following way: anyone who understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he has used them &mdash; as steps &mdash; to climb up beyond them.

He must transcend these propositions, and then he will see the world aright.<br /><cite>&mdash; Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, 6.54</cite>

<p>I like Wittgenstein's image of climbing the ladder and then discarding it. I'm beginning to see such ladders in many aspects of my life &mdash; not just intellectually (my early Randianism) but also creatively (e.g., the songs and guitar music I've written, the last of which I composed in 1995). Unfortunately my life is too busy right now to let go of these ladders completely, because I just don't have time to record my music or complete the purgation of Randianism from my mental life (which I feel will happen by writing the two books I've planned about her ideas).  So I am hanging on to the top rung of these ladders, waiting to let go &mdash; which is rather frustrating for me.</p>
<p>Specifically with respect to Rand, I feel that I am no longer holding onto the ladder emotionally, and I must say it is a wondrous feeling to be free of Rand after all these years. Although the whole Randian outlook is still part of me in some sense, I feel quite free of it now (politically, ethically, emotionally, aesthetically), and that freedom presents new vistas to me. As noted in recent entries, I have been re-reading Whitman recently and venturing far afield in my thinking and reading (everything from gnosticism to the works of <a href="http://www.monadnock.net/fanspaces/zamyatin/">Zamyatin</a>), which has definitely contributed to this sense of freedom.</p>
<p>A few months ago I started (and then stopped) re-reading <cite>The Fountainhead</cite> for the first time since I was 19 (I'm turning 35 this summer). Actually I have started to re-read this novel several times in the last 15 years and each time I have stopped after a few chapters. This time I felt myself more disturbed than ever by what I was reading. Here on display for all the world to absorb are some incredibly damaging false dichotomies such as reason vs. emotion and self vs. world. Oh how deeply I fell into Rand's worldview, and more than that her angry sense of life, when I was a teenager! Were it not for my desire to document some of my own thoughts on Rand (in large measure in order to save others from some of the things I went through), I would never re-read Rand again. But I still feel within me the seed of <a href="http://tao-of-roark.com/">The Tao of Roark</a> and what that book could be, so I keep on keeping on. I really would like to share my perspective on Rand, since I feel that few people have written about her sympathetically but critically (it's all either slavish devotion or implacable enmity), and certainly not with any aesthetic sense.</p>
<p>Part of the challenge is that Rand was a master of rhetoric, which is much of  what gives the Rand meme is virulence. I often compare Rand's style with that of Nietzsche.  Rand the arch-rationalist is highly emotional and "sneaky" in her literary appeal (you just swallow her whole, hook line and sinker) whereas Nietzsche the supposed irrationalist writes in a way that practically forces you to think. A friend recently mentioned to me that Hiram Haydn (Rand's editor at Random House) once said that she was "a crackpot, though of a noble sort".  That certainly captures it if you ask me....</p>
