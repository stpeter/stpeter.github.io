<p>My publication activity at the Monadnock Valley Press waxes and wanes; 2022 was a busy year, 2023 was relatively quiet, and in 2024 I republished more works from the public domain than in any previous year since founding the site in 2008 (e.g., I published on 118 separate days this year, whereas the average in previous years was 18!). This time around the haul included:</p>
<ul>
<li>The complete plays of William Shakespeare.</li>
<li>Novels by Charlotte BrontÃ« and Daniel Defoe.</li>
<li>Epic poems by Apollonius of Rhodes, Hesiod, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.</li>
<li>Non-fiction books by Aristotle, Boethius, Darwin, Erasmus, and Schiller.</li>
<li>Essays and addresses by John Adams, Matthew Arnold, Randolph Bourne, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Ben Franklin, William Hazlitt, David Hume, Thomas Jefferson, John Milton, Albert Jay Nock, George Santayana, Louis Sullivan, and Frederick Jackson Turner.</li>
<li>Several hundred poems by William Basse, William Blake, Louise Bogan, Anne Bradstreet, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, William Cullen Bryant, Robert Bridges, Lord Byron, Thomas Carew, William Collins, Abraham Cowley, George Crabbe, Samuel Daniel, John Dryden, George Eliot, Robert Frost, Thomas Gray, Robert Hillyer, Langston Hughes, Ben Jonson, John Keats, Richard Lovelace, Andrew Marvell, Edna St. Vincent Millay, John Milton, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Edmund Spenser, Thomas Traherne, Henry Vaughan, Edmund Waller, and William Wordsworth.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, 2025 will likely be much less prolific, since I have books of my own to write; I'll probably focus on works that help move my own projects forward, such as ancient Greek drama and history along with a few epic poems.</p>
