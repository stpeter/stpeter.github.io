<h2>A Visit to the Met</h2>
<h3>2002-01-02</h3>
<p>In between stops at the World Trade Center site and my favorite Greek restaurant (Symposium, on 113th Street -- absolutely scrumptious baklava!), Elisa and I enjoyed a quick visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art last Saturday. The two memorials by sculptor D.C. French in the American Wing -- the <a href="http://www.chesterwood.org/hidden/sites/site23.html">Melvin Memorial</a> and <a href="http://www.chesterwood.org/hidden/sites/site6.html">Milmore Memorial</a> -- held special meaning for me this time, although I've always found them quite moving. Other works I especially enjoyed were a Chinese scroll painting of fishes (playfully rendered and full of life) and a powerful statue of Bodhisattva Maitreya ("the Buddha of the Future") from 2nd or 3rd century Pakistan.</p>
