<header><title>Tao Te Ching ยง56: One with the Way</title><date>2023-08-26</date></header>
<entry>
<p>Following up on my previous renderings of chapter 1 and chapter 11 of the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite>, here is my initial attempt at chapter 56:</p>
<blockquote>
Those who know don't say<br/>
Those who say don't know
<br/><br/>
Close the mouth<br/>
Shut the door<br/>
Blunt the edge<br/>
Loose the knot<br/>
Dim the glare<br/>
Join the dust<br/>
Be one with the Way
<br/><br/>
Reach this and you'll be<br/>
Neither far nor near<br/>
Neither helped nor harmed<br/>
Neither praised nor blamed<br/>
Yet prized by all the world
</blockquote>
<p>The first section echoes the initial line of chapter 1: "the way that we can say is not the ageless Way." I read the middle section as recommending the Taoist practices of silence, moderation, humility, curiosity, simplicity, and naturalness. Cultivating these practices can help you become one with the ageless Way. As a result, you will be neither too distant nor too familiar with other people; you will not be influenced too positively or negatively by other people's opinions; and you won't attach too much significance to praise or blame. Paradoxically, your excellence of character will lead you to be prized by all the world.</p>
