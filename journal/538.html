<h2>Email Delenda Est</h2>
<h3>2004-06-17</h3>
    <p>Cato the Elder ended all of his speeches in the Roman Senate with the phrase "Carthago delenda est" -- Carthage must be destroyed. I feel about email as Cato felt about Carthage, but with much better reason. Carthage was home to a thriving and largely peaceful commercial culture; email is home to junk, porn, viruses, and spam. Truly, <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2004/05/02#emailIsASlum">email is a slum</a>, and I've decided to do something about it by striving to live email-free. If people contact me via email about Jabber-related matters, I tell them to use Jabber. I have converted my subscriptions to every possible email list from email to "nomail" by reading the messages in <a href="http://pan.rebelbase.com/">Pan</a> via the wonderful <a href="http://www.gmane.org/">Gmane</a> service ("mail to news and back again"). I have asked the good people at Gmane to add a number of other open lists that I follow. I'm using Jabber chatrooms for communication (all <a href="http://www.jabber.org/muc-logs/">logged</a> for future reference). I'm investigating ways to build news-like messaging services on top of the XMPP <a href="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0060.html">publish-subscribe</a> extension. I'm cheering on those who are developing reliable SMTP gateways ("from mail to Jabber and back again", anyone?). I'm blogging more about Jabber and will try hard to publish the <a href="http://www.jabber.org/journal/">Jabber Journal</a> more often. I'm doing everything I can to eliminate the scourge of email, at least in my own life.</p>
    <p>Email delenda est!</p>
