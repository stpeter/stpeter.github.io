<h2>My First Entry</h2>

<p>Well, I've decided to throw out all my old email logs dating back to 1994 (note to future biographers: sorry!) and instead to start keeping a journal. I see this space as part diary, part sandbox, and part weblog -- a place to explore ideas and events on the web, in real life, and in my head. Hopefully someone other than me will find it interesting. :) One feature that I hope will set this journal apart is that I will move both forward and backward in time from today, reflecting not only on current happenings but also on my past (based in large part on those old email logs). We'll see if it works!</p>
