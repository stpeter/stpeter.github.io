<p>Marc Andreessen recently posted some <a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/the_pmarca_guid.html">interesting thoughts</a> about personal productivity at his new blog (HT: <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/06/tips_from_marc_.html">Tyler Cowen</a>). Not infrequently, I have people ask me about how I stay productive. I don't have a strict system as Marc seems to (I'm not much into systems, got that out of my system if you will back in my old <a href="/writings/rand/">Randian</a> days), but I do tend to keep most of my time open. Some would say I'm also a fan of <a href="http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/">structured procrastination</a> (isn't that one definition of blogging?) but I wouldn't go that far. In large measure I keep on track with Jabber work by regularly referring to the <a href="https://xmpp.org/xsf/roadmap.shtml">XSF roadmap</a> and my dotplan (not that I quickly complete the items on those pages, but I do try to keep them all going in parallel). Plus, maintaining an empty inbox really helps me stay focused. Finally I don't watch TV (except for baseball, but you don't need to pay much attention to that) and I don't have kids. It all adds up. :)</p>
