<h2>Stagflation</h2>
<h3>2009-05-03</h3>
<p>Over the past week or so I've been reading a lot about the economy. Some observers like <a href="http://www.hsdent.com/">Harry Dent</a> argue that the next great depression is here, with serious economic contraction, asset deflation, and consumer price deflation. Based on the <a href="http://www.zealllc.com/2009/biginf.htm">tremendous increase in the money supply</a> being generated by the Federal Reserve, others argue that hyperinflation is on the way. I don't see how we can avoid asset deflation because residential and commercial real estate holdings have been vastly inflated and need to come back to earth. Yet I also don't see how we can avoid inflation in consumer prices, despite decreased demand. Therefore it seems to me that we are probably in for something like the <a href="1181.html">1970s</a>: economic stagnation and price inflation at the same time, a.k.a. stagflation.</p>
<p>May you live in interesting times.</p>
