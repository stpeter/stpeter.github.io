<h2>10 Years of Blogging</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>
</h3>
<h3>2010-11-21</h3>
<p>Today is the tenth anniversary of <a href="74.html">my first blog post</a>, which I made at my journal before I started blogging more regularly at saint-andre.com (since moved to stpeter.im). I've never figured out a good way to migrate the old posts from my journal over to my official blog because they went forward and backward in time from that first post and also because they overlap somewhat with my blog, but I'm rather fond of those early posts -- many of which were pulled out of emails I sent to friends and listservs in the days when people used to write long missives to each other instead of 140-character tweets and text messages.</p>
