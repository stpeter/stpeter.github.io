<p>Now for something completely different. :)</p>
<p>When asked about their favorite piece of music by Beethoven, most people would probably name the Moonlight Sonata, the Fifth Symphony, or something else that's quite famous. I grant that I love Glenn Gould's recording of the Lizst transcription for piano of the Fifth Symphony. My absolute favorites, however, are the Ecossaises (WoO83) -- six charming little sketches that all together total about two minutes of music. I have them in a recording by Alfred Brendel, and every time I hear them I find myself looping through the set three or four times in a row.</p>
