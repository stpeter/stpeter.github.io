    <p>Here's an intriguing idea for a book: a collection of poems in Sapphic meter. Sapphics are my favorite form (see <a href="/writings/fire/ancientfire.html">Ancient Fire</a> and <a href="/writings/fire/cobalt.html">Cobalt</a>), and they've been wielded so deftly over the years -- by Sappho herself and her contemporary Alkaios in the original Greek, by Catullus and Horace in Latin, by the likes of Cowpers and Swinburne in English, by a number of German poets (Klopstock, Platen, Hamerling, Geibel, etc.), and by recent Anglo-American poets like John Hollander, Timothy Steele, A.E. Stallings, Rachel Hadas, James Merrill, Marilyn Hacker, and Rachel Wetzsteon. I feel like a poetic lepidopterist -- I think I'll start hunting sapphics today!</p>
