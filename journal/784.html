<h2>The Outrage</h2>

    <p>Bob Dole used to ask "Where's the outrage?" Well, it's here: Americans across the political spectrum are <a href="http://www.castlecoalition.org/announcements/kelo-polls-6-28-05.asp">outraged</a> at the Supreme Court's odious decision in the case of <a href="http://www.ij.org/private_property/connecticut/">Kelo v. New London</a>, allowing governments to take property from one person and give it to another for private use as long as "the public" (read: local governments) will benefit through increased tax revenues. I'm sure that your home or business could bring in much higher tax revenues if it were converted into a luxury high rise, a hotel, a big box retailer, or a fast food restaurant. Think it can't happen? Think again. The Supremes have given the green light to confiscation of private property anywhere in America, and unholy alliances of unprincipled politicians and greedy developers are <a href="http://www.ij.org/private_property/connecticut/6_29_05pr.html">already springing into action</a>. But the people are fighting back. An enterprising soul in New Hampshire has proposed to <a href="http://www.freestarmedia.com/hotellostliberty1.html">confiscate the vacation home of Justice David Souter</a> for the "Lost Liberty Hotel". Great idea! The people need to put some serious pressure on any politician or developer who attempts to cash in on the Kelo debacle, any judge who allows property confiscation to proceed, any business that tries to use eminent domain for their own benefit. The <a href="http://www.castlecoalition.org/">Castle Coalition</a> is leading the fight by organizing local citizens across the country, <a href="http://www.castlecoalition.org/announcements/governor-contact1.asp">encouraging governors</a> to sign the <a href="http://www.ij.org/private_property/castle/6_29_05pr.html">"Hands Off My Home"</a> pledge, providing materials and legal support for those threatened with eminent domain abuse, and much more. It's time to get busy. Kelo is only the start. We have not yet begun to fight!</p>
