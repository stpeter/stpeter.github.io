<p>One of my favorite things to eat in the summer (and in truth all year round) is hummus. Because multiple people have requested my recipe over the years, I figured I'd share it here.</p>
<p>There are only eight ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>15 oz canned garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed</li>
<li>2 medium cloves garlic, minced by hand or through a press</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>pinch cayenne</li>
<li>juice of one lemon (2½-3 tablespoons)</li>
<li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
<li>¼ cup tahini</li>
<li>⅛ cup water</li>
</ul>
<p>Place all ingredients in a food processor and process for 10-15 seconds. That's it!</p>
<p>I like my hummus thick, garlicky, and slightly chunky - if your preferences differ, increase the water a bit, cut back on the garlic, and increase the processing time.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
