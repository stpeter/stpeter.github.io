<h2>Considering Anarchism</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>

<h3>1996-11-13</h3>
<p>While out mowing the lawn today, the following question occurred to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can conceive of morality without God, why can you not conceive of society without government?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not an anarchist -- yet -- but I do think there is an interesting analogy here between faith and force.  The conventional view is that there can be no morality without god -- that only faith can provide ethics with objective rules and limit individual behavior (recall Dostoevsky: "Without God, anything is possible").  Another conventional view is that there can be no society (only a Hobbesian state of nature) without government -- that only a monopoly on the use of force can provide objective rules and limits to social behavior.  Is it possible that <em>both</em> conventional views are wrong?  Do not both views deny the power of self-ownership, self-responsibility, self-government?  Did Rand once again not go far enough by shutting out religion but leaving the door open even just a crack for government?  Something for me to think about.  I've never even considered anarchism.  I think it's time for me to do some reading on the subject, because if I'm going to reject it, at least I want to know what I'm rejecting.</p>
