<h2>Unschooling</h2>
<h3>2003-10-26</h3>
<p>I just found <a href="http://www.naturalchild.com/guest/earl_stevens.html">this essay</a> on "unschooling". I especially like this sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>The traditional curriculum is based on the assumption that children must be pursued by knowledge because they will never pursue it themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>School and I never got along, and I always learned more outside of school (reading, working, playing music, etc.) than I ever did in the structured world of classes and quizzes. I think I've always been an unschooler, but I never knew it until now.</p>
