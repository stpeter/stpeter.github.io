<h2>Got Examples?</h2>

<h3>2008-08-08</h3>
<p>I try to put a lot of examples in the protocol specs I write (as I like to say, "we put the example in example.com"). So when Jeff Williams of <a href="http://www.gadgetworks.com/">Gadgetworks</a> recently <a href="https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/jingle/2008-July/000127.html">noted</a> on the <a href="https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jingle">jingle@xmpp.org</a> discussion list that a number of the examples in the Jingle specs are not valid in accordance with the XML schemas (or even well-formed), I was chagrined but also intrigued. Off-list, Jeff and I have worked a bit on the Jingle examples and schemas, but he's found it painful to manually extract all the examples from the specs for testing purposes. So late this afternoon I wrote a <a href="http://svn.xmpp.org:18080/browse/~raw,r=2147/XMPP/trunk/extensions/examples.xsl">small XSLT</a> to automatically extract all the examples from a <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/">XEP</a> (wrapped by a &lt;stream&gt;&lt;/stream&gt; element) and write them to a file. I've run the transformation on all the XMPP extensions we've published so far, and the results are available at &lt;<a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/examples/">https://xmpp.org/extensions/examples/</a>&gt;. I'm sure there are many errors to be found (e.g., I know some examples don't parse because they include things like "[...]" in place of elided markup), but we'll work to clean those up over time. Feel free to report any errors to me <a href="/contact.html">directly</a>, or on the appropriate <a href="https://xmpp.org/community/mailing-lists.html">discussion list</a>. Have fun!</p>
