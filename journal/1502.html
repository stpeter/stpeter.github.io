<h2>Clearing the Decks</h2>
<h3>2014-01-19</h3>
<p>In preparation for my <a href="1501.html">new gig</a>, I've been actively tuning out extraneous information sources: email discussion lists, Twitter users, blogs, news websites, financial commentators, political pundits -- you name it, I've started to ignore it. Most of it is distracting chatter. More to the point, very little of it helps me improve as a technologist, as a teammate, as a person. Better, I think, to spend my time diving more deeply into real code and APIs; to absorb big ideas through books, specs, and papers; to interact directly with people who are important to me and to the goals we're achieving together; to devote longer blocks of time to actual work.</p>
<p>At the least, these are habits I'm working to learn. Self-management is a never-ending pursuit...</p>
