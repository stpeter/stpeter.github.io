<h2>Guns</h2>
<h3>2003-08-24</h3>
<p>Although I think that human beings have the moral and constitutional right to keep and bear arms, and that (as John Lott has shown) <a href="http://isbn.nu/0226493644">more guns mean less crime</a>, I am not a gun owner. Yet. This weekend I started educating myself about handguns. I've found the <a href="http://www.chuckhawks.com/index2b.handguns.htm">Handgun Information Page</a> (created by Chuck Hawks) to be extremely useful, with helpful pages about <a href="http://www.chuckhawks.com/first_handgun.htm">good guns for beginners</a>, a <a href="http://www.chuckhawks.com/handgun_types.htm">guide to gun types</a>, information about <a href="http://www.chuckhawks.com/used_handgun.htm">buying used guns</a> (I always prefer to buy major items used if at all possible), and much more. Janis Cortese's <a href="http://www.io.com/~cortese/firearms/index.html">handgun info page</a> is also good. Hawks makes a compelling argument that a good target gun (.22 LR caliber) is the place to start, even though such a gun is not the one you'd want to be using in a defensive situation (the first priority at the beginning is to learn to shoot straight!). The <a href="http://www.ruger.com/">Ruger</a> <a href="http://www.ruger.com/Firearms/FAProdView?model=193&amp;return=Y">P512</a> and <a href="http://www.ruger.com/Firearms/FAProdView?model=192&amp;return=Y">KP512</a> seem like good target guns based on my research. Handguns from <a href="http://www.glock.com">Glock</a> get uniformly high reviews; though it seems they don't make a .22 caliber target gun, they do make fine weapons in higher calibers (both <a href="http://www.chuckhawks.com/glock17_22_31.htm">full size</a> and <a href="http://www.chuckhawks.com/glock19.htm">compact</a>). Massad Ayoob <a href="http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles2/ayoob81.html">recommends</a> .45 caliber handguns, such as the <a href="http://www.glock.com/g21.htm">Glock 21</a> and <a href="http://www.glock.com/g30.htm">Glock 30</a>, but it seems that's not the place to begin given the recoil of large-caliber handguns. I've also started looking into training courses such as those offered by <a href="http://www.safearms.com/">Colorado Safearms Academy</a> and <a href="http://www.nmpistoltraining.com/">Fred Behnken</a> (who seems to come up to Denver from Albuquerque). The NRA <a href="http://www.nrahq.org/education/training/basictraining.asp">maintains a list</a> of such training courses, too.</p>
<p>I'm still mostly ignorant when it comes to guns (as it seems most people are), which is a shame considering the importance of knowing how to defend oneself. But at least I'm slowly making progress in moving from ignorance to knowledge.</p>
