<h2>Leadville</h2>
<h3>2001-11-20</h3>
<p>Hmm, is this a <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/Stories/0,1002,146%257E228485,00.html">real-life Galt's Gulch</a>? Not quite, but it does warm my heart to learn that the mountain town of Leadville, Colorado <a href="http://www.lpcolorado.org/cl/2001/11hill.html">now has</a> a Libertarian majority on the city council. At one time I was heavily involved in the Libertarian Party (I even started a run for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1996), so it's good to see them having some success. Even though Leadville is small, it is, at 10,152 feet above sea level, the highest incorporated town in the U.S., so you could say that the Libertarian Party now commands the heights! :-) I'm thinking perhaps Elisa and I will take a drive up to Leadville over the holiday weekend and see what all the fuss is about. I emailed a bit with the author of the above-referenced article and he said Leadville is a town with real people in it, unlike so many Colorado mountain towns (can you say Aspen?). Sounds good to me.</p>
