<h2>Manufacturism</h2>

    <p>In the latest issue of my favorite newspaper, the <a href="http://www.washingtonparkprofile.com/">Washington Park Profile</a>, we learn of "Manufacturism", a new movement in conceptual "art":</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Manufacturism is conceptual art that manufests products and services as the byproduct of a creative idea.</p>
      <p>Anthony Harper and Manufacturistic colleagues create a glaring statement about racism in the 21st Century, with a new piece called Unwanted Hair, a three-piece body of conceptual art consisting of a sculpture made of human hair, a donation bank, and a book of photographs with creative commentary from fellow artists. Conceptually, this piece of work is rooted in the fact that, this year a donation of African-American locked hair was deemed "inappropriate," and rejected by the national non-profit cancer organization, Locks of Love.</p>
      <p>Harper and Nonthaveth have taken homeless signs off the streets and into an artistic body of work called Dollar$igns. Homelessness is branded by the all-to-familiar exploitive imagery of an individual holding a brown cardboard sign on a street corner asking for help. Dollar$igns removes this element of exploitation by presenting "help" signs as art.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Oy vey. I'm all in favor of protest and questioning authority. But I'm also in favor of art, not so-called art that requires no craft or talent. And no, don't submit a request that I add "manufacturism" to <a href="/writings/ismbook/">The Ism Book</a>.</p>
