<h2>Musical Musings</h2>
<h3>2002-02-01</h3>
<p>A while back I wrote a <a href="100.html">journal entry</a> about a music project that <a href="http://www.monkey.org/~jefrey/">Jeffrey Lindon</a> and I were thinking of working on together. We have put that on hold for now (though we both definitely want to return to it). In the meantime, Jeffrey has written seven short pieces for piano inspired by my <a href="/writings/fire/urban.html">Urban Haiku</a> (tangent: I didn't realize that there is a <a href="http://www.home.earthlink.net/~gosha01/UrbanHaiku/UrbanHaiku.html">recognized genre</a> of urban haiku). Jeffrey reports that a performance of these pieces will take place in Baltimore on April 10th or 14th. I'll post more information as I receive it.</p>
<p>Jeffrey <a href="http://www.monkey.org/~jefrey/bio.html">mentions</a> on his website that he's studying with Nicholas Maw, who has written a Violin Concerto that sounds intriguing. Speaking of music, as I was driving home from work last night (too cold to bike, even for me!) I heard a recording of some incidental music that Fauré wrote for <cite>Pelleas et Melisande</cite>. Gorgeous music. I like Fauré's music a lot, from what I've heard.</p>
