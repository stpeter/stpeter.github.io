<h2>A Matter of Some Gravity</h2>
<h3>2007-12-13</h3>
<p>Last night I read a fascinating paper by Richard Mackey entitled <a href="http://www.griffith.edu.au/conference/ics2007/pdf/ICS176.pdf">Rhodes Fairbridge and the idea that the solar system regulates the Earth's climate</a> (HT: <a href="http://www.samizdata.net/blog/archives/2007/12/there_are_cold.html#164686">ArtD0dger</a>). I need to re-read it (and follow up on the references) in order to understand it more fully, but as far as I can see Fairbridge makes a plausible argument that:</p>
<ol>
<li>The solar system is not <em>quite</em> heliocentric since its center of mass is not exactly the center of the sun (because of the gravitational forces exerted by the planets, especially Jupiter).</li>
<li>Therefore, the sun experiences chaotic but somewhat patterned changes in its fusion process and the like.</li>
<li>As a result, the solar wind and solar tide change over time.</li>
<li>These changes affect the earth's climate in somewhat predictable ways.</li>
</ol>
<p>The upshot of the most recent predictions is that the years 2010-2040 may be unusually cold on the third planet from the sun. Stay tuned for details...</p>
