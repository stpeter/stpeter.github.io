<h2>A Matter of Terminology</h2>

<p>People keep talking about the war in Iraq. Is it war? As far as I can see, the war ended when Saddam Hussein was captured. Since that time, the conflict has been not a war but an occupation.</p>
<p>The war removed Saddam's regime; the occupation has been an attempt at nation-building.</p>
<p>We must be accurate in our language if we are to be clear in our thinking.</p>
