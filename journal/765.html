<h2>Revision-Ism</h2>
<h3>2005-06-08</h3>
    <p>About fifteen years ago I wrote the first version of <a href="http://www.ismbook.com/">The Ism Book</a> for a friend of mine. In 1996 I placed it online (it was tailor-made for hypertext) but I have not revised it since. Amazingly, people still use it as a reference, which scares me a bit because I now find the definitions embarrassingly biased in places. So I've decided to bite the bullet by updating the whole thing. In the last five days or so I've worked my way through the definitions under letters A and B, and I'm now up to "cognitivism". I hope to maintain the momentum and finish these changes in the next few months, but I won't post any of the changed definitions until I'm done since I've modified the XML format and there are numerous cross-references in the text. Stay tuned for updates!</p>
