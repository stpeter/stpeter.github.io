<h2>Heresy</h2>
<h3>2002-07-13</h3>
<p>As the Turkish government <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/europe/newsid_2124000/2124403.stm">slowly falls apart</a>, there are <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/middle_east/newsid_2121000/2121758.stm">continued stirrings</a> of reform in Iran. Those who fomented Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979 have been clinging to power for the last 5 years even though reformers have been elected to the Presidency and to majorities in the parliament. Every revolution turns reactionary eventually: it's as true in thought and culture (as witness, among others, the modernist and Chomskyan revolutions) as it is in politics. <a href="http://www.monadnock.net/fanspaces/zamyatin/">Yevgeny Zamyatin</a> realized this soon after the Russian Revolution: "The world is kept alive only by heretics."</p>
