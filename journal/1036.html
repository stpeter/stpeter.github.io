<h2>The New Year</h2>
<h3>2006-12-31</h3>
    <p>Here's a choice and timely quote from Mark Twain regarding New Year's resolutions:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Now is the accepted time to make your regular annual good resolutions. Next week you can begin paving hell with them as usual. Yesterday, everybody smoked his last cigar, took his last drink, and swore his last oath. Today, we are a pious and exemplary community. Thirty days from now, we shall have cast our reformation to the winds and gone to cutting our ancient shortcomings considerably shorter than ever.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I don't think I've ever made a New Year's resolution, and I don't think I ever shall.</p>
    <p>But speaking of the new year, dontcha think it's appropriate to lop off the millennium and call this one "007"? :-)</p>
