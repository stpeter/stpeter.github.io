<h2>Jabber Evolution</h2>
<h3>2002-03-06</h3>
<p>The fun continues in the Jabber community. I mean that in a positive sense -- we're learning how to work together, moving forward on many fronts, and growing in important ways. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our recent <a href="http://www.jabber.org/ietf/">IETF Submission</a>, which I was deeply involved in but which really came about as a result of prodding by James Barry.</li>
<li>Our discussions in the <a href="http://mailman.jabber.org/pipermail/standards-jig/">Standards JIG</a> regarding recent <a href="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/">Jabber Enhancement Proposals</a>.</li>
<li>The steady growth in traffic on the JADMIN and JDEV mailing lists. It's tough to keep up with it all, but that's better than having no discussion.</li>
<li>The fact that we're revisiting some thorny issues like the Jabber trademark and the development of standards for Jabber compliance. Jabber Council member Mike Lin just sent a <a href="http://mailman.jabber.org/pipermail/members/2002-March/000804.html">great post</a> to the members@jabber.org list laying out the issues surrounding the trademark. I trust that we'll be able to sort all that out.</li>
<li>I think we've learned from our mistake with the early formation of so many Jabber Interest Groups, and I have just submitted to the Jabber Council a <a href="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0019.html">proposal</a> for streamlining them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now if only there were little more code being developed, but I hope to do something about that as well, before long....</p>
