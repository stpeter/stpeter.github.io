<h2>The Dutch Connection</h2>
<h3>2004-12-12</h3>
    <p>I've been emailing a bit with <a href="http://www.peaktalk.com/">Pieter Dorsman</a>, a Dutch expat who it seems has lived most of his adult life in the Anglosphere and closely allied places such as Hong Kong. In <a href="http://www.peaktalk.com/archives/000953.php">taking note</a> of my <a href="584.html">brief review</a> of Russell Shorto's book on the New Netherland colony, Dorsman observes that the Dutch are the <a href="http://www.peaktalk.com/archives/000207.php">most Anglo-Saxon of Europeans</a> (perhaps no surprise, since the closest language to Old English was Old Frisian). Dorsman's many observations on <a href="http://www.peaktalk.com/archives/cat_dutch_politics.php">Dutch politics</a> are quite interesting.</p>
    <p>Although in modern history the Dutch have not maintained as much independence from statist trends in Europe as have the nations of the Anglosphere (perhaps because the English Channel provided a stronger natural barrier than did the Dutch lowlands), the Netherlands might still be a good connecting point between the Anglosphere and Continental Europe.</p>
