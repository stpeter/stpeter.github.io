<h2>Long-Term Projects</h2>
<h3>2015-02-25</h3>
<p>People I interact with sometimes ask me how I accomplish so much. The last time I gave some thought to it, I wrote a blog post about <a href="1466.html">My To-Don't List</a> - all the things I don't spend time on.</p>
<p>A recent conversation with my friend and &amp;yet teammate <a href="https://adambrault.com/">Adam Brault</a> yielded another insight: the power of long-term projects.</p>
<p>As an example, in the last week I've had two major specifications on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-uta-tls-bcp/">security</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-precis-framework/">internationalization</a> approved for publication as RFCs through the IETF. Yet the security document is something I've been laboring on for about 18 months, and the internationalization initiative started 5+ years ago when folks in the Internet community realized that our old approach (based on "stringprep") was unsustainable. Right now at the IETF I'm also pushing to finish a few other long-term efforts, including definitions for SIP-XMPP interoperability that I began probably 10 years ago.</p>
<p>And that's far from a record with me. I've been helping to build Jabber/XMPP (and, more broadly, open communication) technologies for over 15 years. My book <a href="/writings/roark/">The Tao of Roark</a> was <a href="1487.html">17 years in the making</a>. I've even written a bunch of guitar pieces and songs that have gone unrecorded for almost 30 years. (That's too long!)</p>
<p>What I tend to do is work on these long-term projects in parallel. At any one time I have several on the front burner and others on the back burner. For example, these days I'm spending a lot of time reading all 7000 pages of Thoreau's Journal in preparation for writing a <a href="/writings/thoreau/">book about his approach to the art of living</a>; however I also continue to do a bit of research on the side into the subjects of subsequent books I have planned on Nietzsche, Aristotle, and Lao Tzu. On the music front, I'm improving my arrangements and performances of <a href="/music/yes/">six pieces by Yes</a> for solo electric bass, but I'm also practicing some <a href="/music/dylan/">songs by Bob Dylan</a> and my own <a href="/music/hagiography/">folk-rock compositions</a>. And even as I finish up an ungodly number of Internet-Drafts at the IETF, I'm also starting to think seriously about some more future-oriented technology initiatives centered on real-time collaboration.</p>
<p>I don't know if working on so many projects in parallel over such long spans of time is the best way to accomplish a lot in life (I always hesitate to say that my way is the right way for anyone else). And it has its hazards: I could get hit by a bus tomorrow and leave all these projects unfinished. Plus it's important to complete something once in a while, if only to get things off my plate. But for me I find that long-term parallel processing is the most effective and engaging approach to getting things done. Your mileage may vary. :-)</p>
