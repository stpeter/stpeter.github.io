<h2>LA Story, Part I</h2>

<h3>2003-09-02</h3>
<p>As <a href="413.html">mentioned</a>, I've been massaging several essays that were requested of me recently by the good people at the <a href="http://www.libertarian.co.uk/">Libertarian Alliance</a> in London. Editorial director Nigel Meek is fast, because he's already posted my essay "Eastern Eyes" as <a href="http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/persp/persp019.htm">Personal Perspectives #19</a>. It's got an ISBN number and everything, and I've already received one friendly email about it from someone who lives just up the highway from me in Fort Collins, Colorado. Four or five more essays are forthcoming in the near future, so stay tuned!</p>
