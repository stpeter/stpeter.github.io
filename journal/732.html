<h2>Kudos</h2>

    <p>This morning over breakfast, I glanced at the cover of the <a href="http://thecherrycreeknews.com/">Central Denver Dispatch &amp; Cherry Creek News</a> and was horrified to see the following headline:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Transit Solutions Gains Kudo</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Forgive me for shouting, but <em>there is no such thing as a kudo!</em></p>
    <p>The English word "kudos" comes directly from the Greek κυδος, a singular noun meaning "glory" (pronounced "koo-doss", not "koo-doze"). To "gain kudos" means to win praise or glory. You don't win a single praise or a single glory for a single good deed, and then win multiple "praises" or multiple "glories" for multiple good deeds. You either win praise or you don't. I suppose I shouldn't expect much from a local monthly paper, but I get rather particular about words borrowed from Greek...</p>
