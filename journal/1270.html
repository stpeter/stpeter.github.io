<h2>Jabber, Cisco, XMPP, and You</h2>
<h3>2008-09-19</h3>
<p>The technology websites have been <a href="http://delicious.com/tag/ciscojabber">abuzz</a> today about Cisco's <a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/news/comments/jabber_acquisition_and_cisco_collaboration/">acquisition</a> of <a href="http://www.jabber.com/">Jabber, Inc.</a>, where I have worked since October 2000. Because a number of folks <a href="http://logs.jabber.org/jdev@conference.jabber.org/2008-09-19.html#13:40:19">seem to be confused</a> about the impact of this news on the XMPP developer community, I'd like to answer a few of today's <a href="http://metajack.im/2008/09/19/xmpp-is-hotter-than-ever/">frequently asked questions</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Will I still be able to run my Jabber server at mydomain.com?</strong> Of course! All Jabber/XMPP software projects and products implement the <a href="https://xmpp.org/">Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol</a>, which is an open standard that anyone can implement or deploy.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Will open-source projects be prevented from using the word "Jabber" in their project names?</strong> No, because the <a href="https://xmpp.org/xsf/">XMPP Standards Foundation</a> (XSF) has a legal agreement with Jabber, Inc. regarding the <a href="https://xmpp.org/trademark/">Jabber trademark</a>, which Cisco has inherited through this acquisition.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Is Cisco going to shut down the <a href="https://xmpp.org/xsf/">XSF</a>?</strong> No. They couldn't do that even if they wanted to, because the XSF is a legally independent, non-profit organization that is not controlled or owned by Jabber, Inc. But they don't want to. Indeed, they think the presence of a strong, independent standards development organization is a good thing.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Will Cisco continue Jabber, Inc.'s support of the XSF, in particular by sponsoring you (Peter Saint-Andre) to keep writing all those XMPP specifications?</strong> Yes. Cisco wants to be very supportive of XMPP standardization, and I am a big factor in XMPP standardization, therefore Cisco wants to be very supportive of me. :)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm excited to be part of the Cisco team, and I think the whole community will see even more good things happening because of their support.</p>
