<h2>Epicurea: Principal Doctrines</h2>
<h3>2009-01-01</h3>
<p>I have completed the first draft of my translation of the <a href="http://monadnock.net/epicurus/principal-doctrines.html">Principal Doctrines</a> of Epicurus. This translation is a work in progress, so feedback is welcome. One distinctive feature of my translation is that it's not only public domain (as all my works are) but also "open source": I spent many hours keying in the original Greek text, character-by-character with full diacritics, so that you have not only my English rendition but also the "source code" (which I have not otherwise been able to find online).</p>
<p> Oh, and next I'll translate what has come down to us as the "Vatican Sayings" (another collection of pithy quotes from Epicurus).</p>
