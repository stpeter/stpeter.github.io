<h2>Don't Wait For The Movie!</h2>

<p>In case you hadn't noticed, I like to write. In fact, it's pretty much all I do, whether professionally or recreationally. So when <a href="http://www.kismith.co.uk/wordpress/">Kevin Smith</a> and <a href="https://el-tramo.be/">Remko Tron√ßon</a> said they were interested in writing a book about <a href="https://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a>, I was intrigued. And when the folks at <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a> said they were interested too, I was doubly intrigued. So Kevin, Remko, and I have committed to writing <cite>XMPP: The Definitive Guide</cite> for O'Reilly, and we're now hard at work. Expect to see it published sometime in 2009. But don't wait for the movie!</p>
