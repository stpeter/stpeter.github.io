<h2>Small Books</h2>

<p>I'm really starting to like small books. Yes, I recently <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596521271.do">wrote a book</a> that's 320 pages long, but in my own reading I've taken to books of under 200 (and preferably 100) pages. Oxford's series of <a href="http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/category/academic/series/general/vsi.do">Very Short Introductions</a> is a good example. Another might be the original 1855, 92-page edition of Whitman's <cite>Leaves of Grass</cite>, which was so short that he said it "would tend to induce people to take me along with them and read me in the open air: I am nearly always successful with the reader in the open air." Others I like: Yevgeny Zamyatin's <cite>We</cite>, Ayn Rand's <a href="http://monadnock.net/rand/anthem.html">Anthem</a>, the fragments of <a href="http://monadnock.net/epicurus/">Epicurus</a> (which I'm still working to translate), and Frederic Bastiat's <cite>The Law</cite>.</p>
<p>Too, I suspect that short books might be the only ones to survive the coming dominance of the e-reader, because you can always squeeze a properly-configured short book in your pocket. If I ever get around to starting a <a href="707.html">public domain press</a>, the printed (as opposed to online) books will all be highly portable, perhaps even tiny (I rather like the thirtytwomo size: 5.5 x 3.5 inches).</p>
