<h2>Yes, Indeed</h2>
<h3>2002-07-23</h3>
<p>On a lark, I went to a concert by <a href="http://www.yesworld.com/">Yes</a> last night in Denver. I've seen them several times in the last two years and have heard them play some amazing pieces of music (the highlight for me this time was "South Side of the Sky"). Although I enjoyed the show and I'm always impressed by their musicianship, I think this will be the last Yes concert I attend -- I get more out of listening to their recordings than paying way too much to hear them live. While I recognize that there can be a certain magic in the live experience, I tend to agree with <a href="http://www.monadnock.net/essays/gould.html">Glenn Gould</a> about the superiority of recorded music.</p>
