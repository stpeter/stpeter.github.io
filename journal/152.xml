<p>Sometimes I wish I liked television. When I'm tired and I just want to loaf around, and my eyes and wrists are tired from computing all week, and I don't have the energy to play guitar or work on an essay or write in my blog or even read, then I wish there was something on television I could enjoy. Oh well. I guess perhaps I'll just surf the web and see if I can find anything interesting out there about <a href="http://www.atomic-swerve.net/tpg/">Epicurus</a> or someone like that. I guess if I had more friends in Denver this would be a good time to hang out in a pub, drink some good beer, and enjoy a bit of intelligent conversation.</p>
