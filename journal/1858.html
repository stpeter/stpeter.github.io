<h2>Tao Te Ching §44: Ageless Life</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>
</h3>
<h3>2024-04-13</h3>
<p>I continue to ponder various poems from the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite> with an eye toward perhaps setting them to music. Here is my provisional rendering of chapter 44:</p>
<blockquote>
Fame or self, which is dearer?<br>
Self or wealth, which is greater?<br>
Gain or loss, which cuts deeper?
<br><br>
Craving makes great luxury<br>
Luxury makes deeper loss
<br><br>
Be content, avoid disgrace<br>
Know when to stop, risk no loss<br>
This way leads to ageless life
</blockquote>
<p>As usual with the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite>, there are paradoxes here. How can gain cut deeper than loss? Is it really possible to live an ageless life?</p>
<p>Although many Taoists after Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu turned away from philosophy and toward the pursuit of life extension or even immortality, I don't read that here; instead, an "ageless life" is one with the ageless Way of the Tao. Such a life can be achieved through moderating your desires, steering clear of fame and wealth, being satisfied with what you have, and pulling back from greed.</p>
