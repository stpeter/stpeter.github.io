<h2>The Final Third</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>

<h3>2026-02-09</h3>
<p>My dear Elisa's passing last week has brought an entire epoch of my life to an abrupt end. This rupture has re-opened my eyes to the inescapable fact that my sands too are running. Given that I'll turn sixty about six months from now, I've realized that the next epoch is the final third of my life.</p>
<p>What can I make of this?</p>
<p>The question has two senses. The first sense is reflective: What is the significance of reaching this point in my life? How can I account for where I am? What account can I give of myself? What are the implications for my identity, my relationships, the roles I play in my family, friendships, community?</p>
<p>The second sense is active: What should I do now? How shall I fill my days? What changes should I make in how I live? What long-term projects must I complete while I have the energy to do so? What meaning can I create in this final third of my life?</p>
<p>Although it might take time to find the answers, this is the urgent soulcraft in which I am engaged as I grieve for my dear Elisa.</p>
