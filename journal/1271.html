<h2>Who Pays for the Orgy?</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>

<h3>2008-09-21</h3>
<p>The financial bailout proposals being bandied about in the District of Columbia are downright scary. This is literally an orgy of unreason. And to quote that not-so-famous line from <cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite>, it's time to ask: "Why pays for the orgy?" The answer, alas, is: those of us who are productive citizens of the United States of America. I don't know how much more of this nonsense people will put up with, but it would not surprise me if those who produce all this wealth start to chafe under the yoke of the political predators who are eating away the substance of this once-great country. </p>
<p> These are sad days for America.</p>
