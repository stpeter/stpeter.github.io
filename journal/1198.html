<h2>DNA Nation</h2>

<h3>2008-02-05</h3>
<p>A man named <a href="http://www.freetimmasters.com/">Tim Masters</a> was recently released in Colorado after 10+ years in prison upon the discovery of DNA evidence implicating another suspect. Similarly, a serial killer in the Denver area was recently implicated in a murder case that had been unsolved for over 20 years, again based on DNA evidence. As more stories like this emerge, I predict that eventually we will hear calls for a universal DNA database. After all, why use mutable, forgeable credentials such as Social Security numbers when you can rely on truly identifying information? I don't say I like it, but I think it may indeed come to pass...</p>
<p>UPDATE: More <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,330381,00.html">here</a>. Scary stuff.</p>
