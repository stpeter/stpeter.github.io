<h2>Elegy for Elisa</h2>

<p>
Her sands have run; her thread has reached its end.<br>
The woman whom I singled out to stride<br>
With me through time, together at my side,<br>
Is wife no more, nor life, nor soul, nor friend.
</p>
<p>
I joyed with her in every hour through years<br>
Of wedded bliss; there was no cause to part.<br>
Now I can’t fill the void within my heart;<br>
My soul must seek a way through all its tears.
</p>
<p>
She was my earth, my moon, my star, my sun;<br>
I’ve lost my ground, my tide, my guide, my light;<br>
The future seems no day but only night.<br>
Her thread has reached its end; her sands have run.
