<p>As I <a href="1316.html">mentioned</a> a while back, I've become a bit obsessed by Bach's Cello Suites. I own a number of recordings of these magisterial works, from Pablo Casals to Yo-Yo Ma, and I've listened to many more (although not yet to that by Stephen Isserlis, whose work I like very much). To date my favorite performances have been those by Janos Starker and Anner Bylsma, but now I think that I have a new favorite: a recording by <a href="http://www.ashmontmusic.com/">Patricia McCarty</a> on viola which manages to do justice to both the sprightly nature of the dances and the contemplative nature of the fugues. Quite a wonderful rendition. I highly recommend it.</p>
