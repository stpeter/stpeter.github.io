<h2>Of Course</h2>
<h3>2005-06-19</h3>
    <p>In the passage from Alexander Baumgarten that I <a href="769.html">quoted</a> earlier today, the author asserted "it is entirely evident that...." In my youth I accepted such statements, but over time I've found them more and more irksome, since I think they are merely a substitute for reasoned argument. The lazy thinker (and writer) says that "of course", "certainly", "obviously", "evidently", "indubitably" his position is correct and that of his opponent is wrongheaded; the clear thinker and writer never uses such lazy phrases. (I must admit that I sometimes use the word "naturally"; but I think that some things are indeed natural, whereas <em>nothing</em> is obvious.)</p>
