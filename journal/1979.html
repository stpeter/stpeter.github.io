<p>Here's something I'm struggling with: if talk is cheap and values are overrated, what's the worth of writing?</p>
<p>For various reasons, I find I have less to say these days, as I focus on the personal world of family, friends, colleagues, neighbors, and some music composition projects I'm working on. Yes, I'm still reading voraciously in and about history, literature, philosophy, music, etc. - and talking about these readings with a few friends - but I seem less inclined to write about these matters. One possibility is that I'm merely waiting for my reflections to gestate into something worth publishing; alternatively, perhaps I'm moving more in the direction of thinkers like Socrates and Pyrrho who never wrote anything at all. Time will tell.</p>
<p>In the meantime, posting might be more sporadic than usual.</p>
