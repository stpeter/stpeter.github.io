<p>For some time now I've toyed with the idea of writing a novel (provisionally entitled <cite>Gods Among Men</cite>) about Alexander the Great and the founder of philosophical skepticism, Pyrrho. Having recently re-read both the <cite>Iliad</cite> and the <cite>Odyssey</cite>, I'm wondering if I could structure the story as an epic poem, almost as if it were translated from the work of an ancient Greek poet deeply influenced by Homer. Here's a draft of the standard invocation of the muse to start things off:</p>
<blockquote>
Sing me, muse, of two men who lived as gods.<br/>
So many were the lands through which they passed,<br/>
So many were the minds from which they learned<br/>
While, by the one man seeking to rule all<br/>
And by the other reaching out to know,<br/>
They travelled far from Greece to India.<br/>
First Alexander, King of Maked≈çn,<br/>
Whose fame will last as long as men shall live:<br/>
Just as a huge wave crashes on the shore<br/>
And smashes all before it when the earth<br/>
Afar is shaken by Poseidon's rage,<br/>
So Alexander broke upon the East,<br/>
Forever changing all within his wake.<br/>
Then second, sing me, too, of one who lived<br/>
Unknown, yet rivalled Zeus for happiness:<br/>
Although he conquered nothing in his path,<br/>
His path led him to conquering within,<br/>
To mastery of no one but himself;<br/>
For wisdom brought him deep serenity.<br/>
From Elis, the Epeians' land, he came;<br/>
Son of Pleistarchos, Pyrrho was his name.<br/>
<br/>
O muse, come be my ally, for I doubt<br/>
The texture of the tale I dare to tell:<br/>
Its warp and woof are lost within the past,<br/>
Beyond recovery, uncertain, dim;<br/>
At this late date the details cannot be<br/>
Defined with clarity; so, uninclined<br/>
To this interpretation or to that,<br/>
I flow within the stream of what has been<br/>
And joy to tell the story of a world<br/>
That had such giants in it, long ago.<br/>
Dread goddess, Zeus' daughter, let us start<br/>
When Pyrrho in his youth took mind to heart...<br/>
