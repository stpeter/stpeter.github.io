<h2>Sayonara, LP</h2>
<h3>2002-08-31</h3>
<p>Spineless.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, I <a href="278.html">expressed hope</a> that I wouldn't have to add that adjective to my description of the Libertarian Party (specifically the <a href="http://www.lpcolorado.org/">Colorado branch</a>). But now I do, because, as Ari Armstrong <a href="http://www.co-freedom.com/2002/08/rsretained.html">reports</a>, the Board of the Colorado LP has voted to retain <a href="http://www.stanley2002.org/">Rick Stanley</a> as its candidate for U.S. Senate this year (there's coverage also in the <a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/election/article/0,1299,DRMN_36_1352476,00.html">Rocky Mountain News</a>). You might as well write off the Colorado LP now, because it has sold its soul (the National LP did that years ago -- it's finally trickling down to the state level). I'll be changing my voter registration from Libertarian to Independent forthwith. I'm especially disappointed in Board members James Vance, Tony Ryan, and <a href="http://colorado.blogspot.com/">Walter Schlomer</a> for abstaining. At least those who voted to retain have made it clear that they value power and media attention over libertarian principles and civilized discourse. Those who abstained showed only that they lack the integrity necessary to take a stand, even when the issues are so clear and the ethical stakes are so high.</p>
