<h2>JabFab</h2>
<h3>2004-12-14</h3>
    <p>It's time.</p>
    <p>We've never held a pure developer conference for people working on Jabber technologies. Oh sure, there was once (actually twice) something called Jabbercon, run by the good folks at <a href="http://www.jabber.com/">Jabber Inc.</a>, but it was a combined business + developer conference, with the main focus on business. Ever since the last Jabbercon in 2001, people like <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2004/06/29#twoYearsOffIsEnough">Doc Searls</a> have been lamenting its disappearance, because it was <a href="http://www.craigburton.com/2001/08/20">fun</a> and <a href="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0009.html">productive</a> to get lots of Jabber-oriented folks together. Justin Kirby of the <a href="http://www.openaether.org/">OpenAether</a> project pinged me this morning about the possibility of resurrecting Jabbercon, and we chatted for quite a while about the idea. Here's my take:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This time we need a true developer conference, similar to <a href="http://www.machack.com/">MacHack</a> and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/events/dev-day-2004/">Mozilla Developer Day</a>.</li>
      <li>Group dynamics are important. <a href="554.html">Dunbar number</a> considerations would point to keeping the size around 40 people, IMHO, but I can probably be argued into something a bit bigger. (Personally I prefer smaller groups in which everyone can get to know each other.)</li>
      <li>It might be best to hold one meeting in North America and one in Europe. Justin chatted with <a href="http://ralphm.net/blog/">Ralph Meijer</a> and they discussed the idea of holding both meetings at the same time, with a chatroom and voice or video link between them. Sounds challenging, but might be fun.</li>
      <li>We need to keep costs down, so running it at a university or finding a corporate host might be best.</li>
      <li>Co-siting it with <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/">OSCON 2005</a> might make sense so that people can get their employers to pay for travel costs (if they have employers, that is).</li>
      <li>What to call it? Along the lines of MacHack, I like the name "JabFab", since it's a place for people who are fabricating Jabber technologies. Plus it should be <a href="http://www.wordreference.com/definition/fab">fab</a>. :-)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So I've started to think about this and plan for it. It's all preliminary so far, but the conversation has begun. Let's make it happen!</p>
