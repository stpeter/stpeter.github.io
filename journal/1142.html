<h2>Something Rotten in Morningside Heights</h2>
<h3>2007-09-26</h3>
<p>As an alumnus of Columbia University (CC '89), I must say I was disgusted (but not surprised) that the school granted Iranian strongman Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the undeserved dignity of a forum for his ravings. Columbia alumna Caroline Glick <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1189411476562&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">says it best</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... what was said yesterday at Columbia is of no consequence whatsoever. What matters is that by inviting Ahmadinejad to its campus, Columbia University announced that supporting or opposing the genocide of the Jews is a legitimate topic for discussion. In so doing, as an institution Columbia has taken itself beyond the pale of legitimate discourse. As an institution, Columbia has embraced depravity by renouncing the intrinsic sanctity of human life.</p>
<p>Columbia's supporters who have defended it over the years through mounting criticism, cannot look at Ahmadinejad's visit to campus as simply another policy dispute without themselves legitimizing the school's belief that genocide is a reasonable subject for debate. They cannot defend the school without themselves rejecting the basic principle of Western civilization - that human beings have an intrinsic right to live.</p>
<p>Given this, it is incumbent on all those affiliated with Columbia who adhere to this basic principle to distance ourselves from the university. As an alumna of Columbia College, class of 1991, it is with great distress that I say it is time to disassociate with the school. This does not simply mean cutting off donations. It means understanding that the problem with Ahmadinejad had nothing to do with legitimate policy debates. It means recognizing and openly stating that by placing genocide on the debating table, Columbia ceased to be an institution that can be said to represent our values. It means stating publicly that we will not send our children to the school. It means stating openly that Columbia has abandoned the moral underpinning of civilization and has descended into the depths of evil. It means stating openly that Columbia is a depraved institution.</p>
