<h2>How Much is a Word Worth?</h2>

<p>Treasury Secretary Paulson's bailout plan has got to be one of the briefest legislative proposals in American history. By my count it weighs in at a mere 840 words. With a projected cost of at least $700 billion, that's $833 million per word. I figure a little editing would enable each word to be worth a cool billion. Why not? A hundred billion here, a hundred billion there, soon you're talking real money!</p>
