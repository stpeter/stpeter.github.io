<p>I just found a <a href="http://www.libertyforall.net/2002/archive/vision.html">good article</a> on pursuing more realistic strategies for freedom. The first half of the article contains some sound reasoning that led me to think the author was going to talk about the <a href="https://www.fsp.org/">Free State Project</a>. He comes tantalizingly close, but in the second half of his article he showed that he is still tied to pursuing national goals through the <a href="https://www.lp.org/">Libertarian Party</a>, which I consider wrongheaded given the fact that the LP has been essentially feckless since its founding 30 years ago.</p>
<p>The author's reasoning about electing a small number of freedom-oriented legislators in order to tip the balance in a specific legislative body makes sense. And he seems to assume (realistically enough) that such a legislative body could not be the U.S. House or Senate, but rather a legislature in "a small to medium state". Makes sense to me. However, one problem with past and present LP efforts, at least as far as I can see, is that they have not targetted any specific state. Rather, the LP has pursued a scattershot approach, with a few good candidates running in any one state in any one year. It would be more productive to run a number of strong candidates in each state. Unfortunately, freedom-minded people (or at least freedom-minded activists) are spread so thinly throughout the United States that the LP is never able to find enough strong candidates in any one state to have a chance of tipping the balance. One solution would be for a relatively large number of freedom-minded people to relocate to one state. This state could then serve as an example to other states, or as a refuge of last resort should the national government turn even more strongly authoritarian. Such a strategy is a logical extension of the reasoning in this article, and is a probably the most realistic strategy for liberty in our lifetimes (try to turn around a small state first, not the QE2 of federal government). Happily, the <a href="https://www.fsp.org/">FSP</a> is a thriving movement that is directed at just such a goal. Whether it turns out to be successful is another matter, but at this point it's starting to shake things up and at least has the advantage of pursuing a realistic strategy, rather than the failed strategies of the LP.</p>
