<h2>Paying Attention</h2>

    <p>Tyler Cowan <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/04/the_best_senten.html">quotes</a> from Richard Lanham's new book <a href="http://isbn.nu/0226468828">The Economics of Attention</a> as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In an economy of stuff, the laws of property govern who owns stuff.  In an attention economy, it is the laws of intellectual property that govern who gets attention.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Wrong. What governs who gets attention is <em>who creates interesting, attention-grabbing content</em> (yes, I loathe the word "content", sorry to use it). The laws don't matter. What you create can be in the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">public domain</a> -- covered and controlled by no laws whatsoever -- and you can still receive plenty of attention (after all, that's exactly what a classic is: an older work in the public domain that continues to garner attention). In fact this blog and my websites are in some ways an existence proof that Lanham is wrong, and I don't even work hard at getting attention, since I'm not particularly interested in that form of currency.</p>
