<p>To keep my sanity and experience more beauty in life, I endeavor to read a few poems every day. To facilitate this practice among other people, I've decided to start a Substack newsletter with a simple mission: publish one classic poem a day from the vast store of English-language verse in the public domain that I've already uploaded to the Monadnock Valley Press website. Check it out at the link below.</p>
