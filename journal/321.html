<h2>Philosopher or Ideologist?</h2>
<h3>2002-12-04</h3>
<p>In another worthy quote from <cite>Human, All Too Human</cite> (Volume II, Part 2, § 171), Nietzsche reflects on those scholars who...</p>
<blockquote><p>lack all <em>impersonal</em> interest in a problem; just as they themselves are personalities through and through, so all their insights and acquirements in the field of knowledge coalesce together into a personality, into a living multiplicity whose individual parts are dependent on one another, cleave to one another, are nourished by the same food, and as a whole possesses its own atmosphere and its own odor. -- Natures such as this produce, with their <em>personality-informed</em> structures of knowledge, the <em>illusion</em> that a science (or even the whole of philosophy) is finished and has reached its goal; it is the <em>life</em> in their structure that performs this magic.... The name usually given to such men is <em>philosophers</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm not so sure -- to me, such "scholars" sound more like ideologists than philosophers.</p>
