<h2>Shadowing Diana</h2>
<h3>2006-07-30</h3>
    <p>The Club for Growth <a href="http://www.clubforgrowth.org/2006/07/435_districts_435_blogs_agains.php">reports</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Thanks to Congressman Jeff Flake's 19 anti-pork amendments, we now have every House member on record regarding their positions on earmarks. Before now, House members have been able to avoid scrutiny because their pork was co-mingled with other projects and tucked into the dark corners of big spending bills. Or they were able to withstand the scrutiny because they were attacked as a whole chamber and not directly attacked themselves. But because of Flake's amendments, they were recently forced to cast up-or-down votes on specific projects.</p>

Methinks that someone in Denver needs to start shadowing Ms. DeGette's every vote. Here's a list of web pages that might be of assistance:</p>
