<h2>Accentuation</h2>

    <p>According to <a href="http://www.gotoquiz.com/what_american_accent_do_you_have">this quiz</a>, my regional American accent is "as Philadelphian as a cheesesteak! If you're not from Philadelphia, then you're from someplace near there like south Jersey, Baltimore, or Wilmington."</p>
    <p>Well. I admit that I lived in New Hope, Pennsylvania for a few years before moving to Denver. But I grew up on the North Shore of Long Island and moved to Maine when I was ten, then went to college in New York City, taught English in Czechoslovakia, worked in Atlanta for two years, and relocated to northern New Jersey for three years before Pennsylvania and then Denver. Maybe if you average that out you end up with Philadelphia, but I doubt it. :-)</p>
    <p>(Then again, according to <a href="http://www.gotoquiz.com/how_mainer_are_you">this</a>, I'm 97% Mainer. I guess I just don't talk like one...)</p>
