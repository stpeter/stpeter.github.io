<h2>Who Owns the Air, Part II</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>

<h3>2002-08-21</h3>
<p>My <a href="275.html">first post</a> of this month pointed to an <a href="https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/members/2002-August/001209.html">email</a> I sent about the ownership (or lack thereof) of the Jabber protocol. In it, I argued that no one owns the protocol -- that it is as free as air. I also apologized if I ever gave the impression that the <a href="https://www.jabber.org/">Jabber Software Foundation</a> owned the protocol. Yet in revisiting the current draft version of the JSF's <a href="https://www.jabber.org/tmp/ipr-0.2.html">IPR policy</a>, I noticed that indeed I had asserted that the JSF owns the protocol. So I must apologize, and seek to make amends.</p>
<p>Specifically, the IPR policy draft talks about people being able to copyright or patent a protocol extension. Yet this is highly questionable to me, because no one (not even the JSF) owns or can assert ownership over the protocol. So right now I think that any given <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/">Jabber Enhancement Proposal</a> needs to acknowledge that the protocol described in the JEP is free (==public domain?), and that all anyone can assert rights to is either documentation of the protocol (the JEP itself, which I think needs to be copyrighted by the JSF) or a specific implementation of the protocol (which implementation can be licensed according to the software license -- open or closed, public or private, free or unfree -- chosen by the code's creator).</p>
<p>So that's where I stand right now. But I need to think about it some more....</p>
