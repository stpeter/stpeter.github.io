<h2>The Top Rungs</h2>

<h3>2004-06-02</h3>
<p>Over the weekend, I wrote the first draft of an essay on Nietzsche and Rand (with quite a bit of Epicurus mixed in for good <a href="/writings/fire/measure.html">measure</a>). Since I'm pretty much a first-draft kind of writer (followed by light editing), this puts me ever closer to letting go of <a href="95.html">the ladder</a> of my early Randianism by completing all of my projected <a href="/writings/rand/">essays on Ayn Rand and Objectivism</a>. Over the last few months I've written a number of these essays, some of which have been gestating in my brain for years. Now I have only to finish an essay comparing Rand with Kurt GÃ¶del and to write a paper on Aristotle and Rand.</p>
<p>I'm on the top rungs of the ladder, and I'm looking forward to letting go.</p>
