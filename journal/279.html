<p>The <a href="http://www.adn.com/">Anchorage Daily News</a> is running an <a href="http://www.adn.com/front/story/1623694p-1741350c.html">article</a> about the candidates running for governor of Alaska from within the <a href="http://www.akip.org/">Alaskan Independence Party</a> (AIP). The fact that Alaska even <em>has</em> a party dedicated to independence is intriguing. No coverage in today's editions of the <a href="http://www.news-miner.com/">Fairbanks News-Miner</a> or the <a href="http://www.juneauempire.com/">Juneau Empire</a>, but I'll keep an eye on them from time to time, as well. I'm not sure if the AIP knows about the <a href="http://www.freestateproject.org/">Free State Project</a>, but the two deserve an introduction.</p> 
<p>Yes, it's easy for someone in the USA to support independence for <a href="http://www.naz-piemonte.leganord.org/english/engver.htm">Padania</a>, <a href="http://www.snp.org.uk/ti/">Scotland</a>, <a href="http://www.vlaams-blok.be/">Flanders</a>, <a href="http://www.rangzen.com/">Tibet</a>, or <a href="http://www.pq.org/">Quebec</a>. The test comes when there are legitimate arguments for independence within one's own borders. For instance, most Americans don't know or care that the <a href="http://www.pixi.com/~kingdom/">Kingdom of Hawaii</a> was overthrown by agents of the U.S. government in 1893 and that Hawaii was annexed in 1898, leading to over one hundred years of "fraternal assistance" from Uncle Sam (the <a href="http://hawaii-nation.org/nation/">Nation of Hawaii</a> site lays out the issues). Similarly, most Americans don't know or care that, in clear contravention of U.N. policies, Alaska was not given a choice in 1958 between independence, remaining a territory, commonwealth status, or statehood. And that's putting aside the question of how Alaska was Russia's to <a href="http://www.everythingalaska.com/eta.sfy.html">sell</a> to the USA in 1867. Hmm, perhaps 2008 (the 50th anniversity of the previous vote) would be a good time to hold a plebiscite on the question of independence? I still think a story about the secession of Alaska would make a great novel!</p>
