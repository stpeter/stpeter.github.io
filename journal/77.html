<h2>A Rant in Verse</h2>
<h3>2000-11-27</h3>
<p>Here's a rant in verse that I just wrote. I'm not sure that it rises to the level of a poem, but it's kinda fun nonetheless...</p>
<p>
I hate the smell of popcorn,<br>
the artificial butter<br>
and fake salt (for all I know)<br>
waft so insidiously that<br>
I breathe only through my mouth --<br>
it makes my throat so dry I<br>
gasp for water and fresh air.<br>
Besides it reminds me of<br>
the movie theatre -- did I<br>
mention that I hate movies?<br>
They make me ill, the moving<br>
pictures and unrealistic<br>
assumptions and patronizing<br>
themes grate on me to no end.<br>
And don't even get me started on<br>
television. Not a word<br>
will I say about <em>that</em> fine<br>
institution, nor about<br>
shopping malls and credit cards,<br>
hot dogs and Coca-Cola.<br>
I guess I must be anti-<br>
American. Yet I love<br>
baseball, the Constitution,<br>
the poetry of Whitman,<br>
the music of Ellington,<br>
and flags of red and white and<br>
blue and only thirteen stars.<br>
But I guess some would say that's<br>
anti-American too.
