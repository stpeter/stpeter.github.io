<h2>Doggerel</h2>
<h3>2021-08-07</h3>
<p>This piece of light verse popped into my head the other day.</p>
<p>Doggerel</p>
<p>
There is no word that rhymes with dog.<br>
Though some appear as if they should<br>
(The log that's fallen in the wood,<br>
The fog that lingers on the coast),<br>
You'll find that at the very most<br>
Their rhymes are slant and that you can't<br>
Just line them up and hope they sound<br>
As up with pup or sound with hound.<br>
The other creatures have their rhymes,<br>
A name that rings and quickly chimes --<br>
The cat is on the mat, of course,<br>
The horse will run with mark√®d force --<br>
But dogs are stuck with no such luck<br>
And strike out when it comes to verse<br>
(Although they seem not much the worse).<br>
No matter how you shake your paws<br>
At strictures of poetic laws,<br>
There is no word that rhymes with dog.
