<h2>Hypocrisy</h2>

<h3>2004-07-23</h3>
    <p>Bill Clinton was in town the other day signing copies of his book and keynoting a fundraiser. I was pleasantly surprised to hear that he was not raising money for the Democratic Party, but for a private effort to fund a memorial to those killed in the shootings at Columbine High School in 1999. This got me to thinking: why doesn't Michael Moore contribute some money to this effort? He's probably earned enough money from <em>Bowling for Columbine</em> to pitch in, no?</p>
    <p>This train of thought led me to reflecting on some other instances of hypocrisy I've witnessed of late. Like, oh, people driving past me while I'm biking to work and they are riding in their cars with Ralph Nader bumper stickers. (Why aren't they getting around town in a more eco-friendly manner?) Or local U.S. Senate candidate Pete Coors touting his conservative principles. (Have you ever seen the scantily-clad young women in a typical advertisement for Coors beer? Nothing traditional or conservative about that!) Or John Kerry bemoaning tax cuts for the better-off (as if anyone else pays many taxes in the first place) and asking for donations even though he could fund his entire candidacy from his personal fortune. Or George Bush saying he values freedom while he and his minions have eviscerated what's left of the Bill of Rights. Or -- well, the list goes on, and this is getting depressing.</p>
