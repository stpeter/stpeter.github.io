<h2>Interstices</h2>

<h3>2004-12-03</h3>
    <p>I've been emailing with <a href="http://www.fau.edu/history/marina.php">William Marina</a> of <a href="619.html">anti-empire</a> fame, who pointed me to his essay <a href="http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=1412">Surviving in the Interstices</a> on finding freedom and preserving civilized values in times of imperial crisis. Surprisingly (at least to me), one of his models is the early Christian community (before it was co-opted by the Roman state). Fascinating. There are connections here to what Claire Wolfe calls <a href="http://www.backwoodshome.com/columns/wolfe040515.html">gulching</a> (though I'm not as pessimistic or <a href="428.html">Thoreauvian</a> as she is) and to the latter parts of my recent essay <a href="/writings/rand/pop.html">Toward a Practical Objectivist Politics</a>, in that all three address the challenge of strengthening the bonds of civil society in an environment characterized by inexorably increasing state power.</p>
    <p>(Marina calls himself a "jewnitariantaoist" -- presumably some combination of Jewish, Unitarian, and Taoist; along the same lines I'd probably have to call myself a taoepicurandian or somesuch.)</p>
