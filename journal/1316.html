<h2>Two Mountains</h2>

<p>For many years now I have been somewhat active in both philosophy and music. In philosophy I've written <a href="/writings/ismbook/">a dictionary of philosophy</a> and a book of <a href="/writings/rand/">essays on Ayn Rand</a>, plus I've started to translate the extant ethical writings of <a href="http://monadnock.net/epicurus/">Epicurus</a> and I'm about one-third done with writing a book entitled <a href="/writings/roark/">The Tao of Roark</a>. In music I've written a number of <a href="/music/hagiography/">songs</a> in styles influenced by folk, rock, jazz, and blues, I've composed three suites and a set of variations <a href="/music/aubade/">for solo guitar</a> in a style influenced by classical and "new age" idioms, I've set Langston Hughes's poem <a href="340.html">Freedom's Plow</a> to voice and guitar (resulting in a piece that's almost 30 minutes long), and I've been working on <a href="/music/yes/">transcriptions</a> for solo bass of some songs by the progressive rock band Yes. This has all been rewarding, but I feel like I've been merely tramping around in the foothills. Lately I've conceived a desire to climb two higher mountains: translate Aristotle's <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> into English and learn to play Bach's cello suites on the bass. It's always good to have something to aim for...</p>
