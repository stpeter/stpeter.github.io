<h2>Poetry Reading</h2>

<h3>2024-04-25</h3>
<p>Yesterday evening I was honored to have a conversation with folks from the poetry circle of the Boulder Writers Alliance, at the invitation of poet Laura Border. Although I don't consider myself a poet or even primarily a writer, it was quite a pleasure to talk with such a welcoming group about the relationship between philosophy and poetry as well as the challenges of poetry translation and the differences between ancient and modern poetry. I also read aloud some poems from my books <cite>Ancient Fire</cite> and <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite>. Because this is a conclave of writers, we also took time toward the end of the session for each participant to write and then read aloud a short poem. Having discoursed a bit during the discussion on the attitudes of Socrates and Plato toward poetry, here's what I composed on the spot with reference to Plato's dialogues <cite>Republic</cite> and <cite>Phaedo</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
Such irony that Socrates,<br>
Fine artist of the wisdom tease,<br>
Who always said the poets lied,<br>
Turned his hand before he died<br>
To making paeans, hymns, and odes -<br>
These works the very antipodes<br>
Of dialogues pursuing reason.<br>
Yes, music always has its season!
</blockquote>
