<h2>Rather Not</h2>
<h3>2004-11-27</h3>
    <p>Although I don't watch TV news, I'm happy to see that both Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw are moving on. The Economist <a href="http://www.economist.com/people/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3428729">opines</a> that these retirements are further signs that the old media are being replaced by something altogether more diverse:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The erosion of the old media establishment probably does entail some shift to the right, if only because so many of the newer voices are more reliably pro-Republican than Mr Rather. But the new media are simply too anarchic and subversive for any single political faction to take control of them....</p>
      <p>Mr Rather's passing does not mean that the liberal orthodoxy is about to give way to a new conservative one. It means that all orthodoxies are being chewed up by a voraciously unpredictable news media, which is surely all to the good.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Hear, hear!</p>
