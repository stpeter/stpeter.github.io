<h2>A Sculpture Walk</h2>
<h3>2007-05-13</h3>
    <p>The last time I was in New York City, I stole a few hours to walk around Morningside Heights and Riverside Park (in the pouring rain!) in search of the many fine public statues I remember from my days at Columbia University. At some point I'll write up a detailed walking tour, but before I forget here are some of the pieces I enjoyed most, in rough walking order from north to south:</p>
