<h2>Hackfest</h2>
<h3>2002-01-14</h3>
<p>We're having yet another Jabber hackfest at Peter Millard's house. Lots of talk about Jabber protocols and design of future features. The first topic after I arrived was invisible mode, which seems fairly straightforward and we might even have it in the soon-to-be-released 1.4.2 server. Now up for discussion: sending binary data over Jabber. Talk about a messy topic.</p>
<p>In other Jabber news, I worked through two <a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/">JEPs</a> today. I still have a few more to clear out of the queue.</p>
