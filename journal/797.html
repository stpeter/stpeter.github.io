<h2>Splogging Along</h2>
<h3>2005-08-19</h3>
    <p>In the beginning there was spam. Then there was spim: spam over IM. Then there was spit: spam over Internet telephony. As Doc <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2005/08/18#makeMoneyTheNewfashionedWayWithSplogs">notes</a>, now there are <a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/1234000870054492/">splogs</a>: spam blogs. Mark Cuban observes:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>We are exploring a variety of options. The blog hosts can obviously help, but I think the best solution will come from the pinging process that is used to let blog search engines know a new post has been added.  If blogging is supposed to be a personal medium, I dont know why we can't use an email confirmation for blog posts.  We do it for comments to keep out comment spam. Why not do it for blog posts?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Seems like we need a strong concept of identity here, eh? The blog hosts, for instance, could verify a person's identity using a system like <a href="http://www.passel.org/">Passel</a> before allowing them to create a blog. As to blog pings, if folks used the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-saintandre-atompub-notify-07.txt">Atom-over-XMPP</a> protocol then aggregators would have a verified identity for the poster; alternatively, aggregators could require that the poster push the update to an HTTP URL that requires sign-in using Passel. Granted, we could do all this using PKI if everyone had X.509 certificates or PGP keys, but that's unlikely to happen anytime soon -- it's more likely that the much-ballyhoed "identity layer" for the Internet will emerge first (heck, even the Mozilla folks are <a href="http://off.net/~shaver/diary/archives/003693.html">getting into the act</a>).</p>
