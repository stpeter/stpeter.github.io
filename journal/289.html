<h2>Words4Nerds #5 and #6</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>

<h3>2002-09-13</h3>
<p>I haven't posted any "words of the week" in a while, though I wrote some on my whiteboard a fortnight or so ago, and this week as well. I can't quite recall Words4Nerds #5 (I know prevaricate, dissemble, and dubiety were on the list), but this week's words, on the theme of power and authority, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>hegemonistic -- relating to the pursuit of dominance</li>
<li>obeisance -- an act or gesture of subservience</li>
<li>puissant -- full of strength and power</li>
<li>magisterial -- in the manner of a master or ruler; imperious</li>
<li>autarchy -- absolute power, despotism</li>
</ol>
<p>That last word provides a fine segue to the first entry in Words4Nerds #7 (strange and obscure terms from the dismal science of economics), but we'll have to wait a week or two for those!</p>
