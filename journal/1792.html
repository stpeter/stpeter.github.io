<h2>The Examined Life</h2>

<p>All the great questions of life boil down to this: What is the best way to live?</p>
<p>The great questions of life include the ones that Socrates posed 2400 year ago: what is courage? what is moderation? what is justice? what is love? what is beauty? what is truth? what is wisdom?</p>
<p>The great questions also include more modern concerns, such as how best to make a living, to find one's calling, or to interact with technology (topics that much exercised Thoreau, for instance).</p>
<p>I suppose that some people don't think about the great questions - instead they skate or slouch or sleepwalk through life, unaware of the deeper themes of human existence.</p>
<p>Others are certain that the great questions have straightforward answers, inherited from a particular creed or religion or cultural tradition.</p>
<p>Socrates often undercut such people's certainty by haranguing them in the Athenian agora. Eventually they got tired of him and put him to death. Yet Socrates had the last laugh: no one remembers his accusers, but they do remember his admonition that the unexamined life is not worth living for a human being. In more positive terms we could phrase it like this: "The best way to live is to never stop asking yourself: What is the best way to live?"</p>
