<h2>Leadville Redux</h2>

<h3>2001-11-27</h3>
<p>Bob Ewegen of the Denver Post has published a <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/Stories/0,1002,146%257E237339,00.html">follow-up article</a> to his piece on "Libertarian Leadville". Although I'm not much for organizations, I'm thinking I might get involved in the <a href="http://www.lpcolorado.org/">Colorado LP</a>. The national party is screwed up (as has been detailed in the pages of <a href="http://www.libertysoft.com/liberty/">Liberty magazine</a>) and I will not join it, but I think I'd be comfortable supporting state and local affiliates of the LP. However, I don't think I'll spend as much time on LP activities as I did back when I lived in Essex County, New Jersey and Bucks County, Pennsylvania.</p>
