<h2>Exclaves</h2>
<h3>2008-08-10</h3>
<p>It strikes me that those of a libertarian (or just live-and-let-live) persuasion would be attracted to localities that are physically separated from the larger political entities of which they are a part (officially such places are known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclave">exclaves</a>). In America that would mean towns you can't get to without passing through another state. For some reason there are a few such places along the borders of Wyoming -- you can't get to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slater,_Colorado">Slater, Colorado</a> from anywhere else in Colorado without going through Wyoming, you can't get to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooke_City-Silver_Gate,_Montana">Cooke City, Montana</a> from anywhere else in Montana without going through Wyoming, and you can't get to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alta,_Wyoming">Alta, Wyoming</a> from anywhere else in Wyoming without going through Idaho.</p>
<p>But my favorite exclave is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Roberts,_Washington">Point Roberts, Washington</a> -- you can't get there from anywhere else in the USA without going through Canada!</p>
