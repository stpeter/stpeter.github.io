<h3>2005-04-19</h3>
<p>A bunch of folks have pinged me about the <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/science_technology/story.jsp?story=630165">astonishing news</a> that a treasure trove of ancient texts will soon be readable again thanks to infrared scanning technologies. Yes, these texts were found in the two-thousand-year-old garbage dump of an obscure Egyptian town and have been essentially unreadable until now. My <a href="118.html">former teacher</a> Dirk Obbink is leading the team that is converting these texts. Personally I'm hoping for the discovery of some of the lost poems of Sappho (much more likely to show up in a garbage dump than some of the lost writings of Aristotle, which would be number two on my wish list).</p>
