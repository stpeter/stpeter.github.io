<p>Probably everybody and their uncle has already pointed to <a href="http://promontoryartists.org/lookingcloser/movie%20reviews/Q-Z/returnoftheking-jrd.htm">this interview</a> with John Rhys-Davies (who plays Gimli in the movie adaptation of <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite>), but it's powerful stuff. In part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that Tolkien says that some generations will be challenged. And if they do not rise to meet that challenge, they will lose their civilization....</p>
<p>What is unconscionable is that too many of your fellow journalists do not understand how precarious Western civilization is and what a jewel it is....</p>
<p>I mean... the abolition of slavery comes from Western democracy. True democracy comes form our Greco-Judeo-Christian-Western experience. If we lose these things, then this is <em>a catastrophe for the world</em>....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read it yourself.</p>
