<h2>Monadnock Valley Press Annual Report 2014</h2>
<h3>2015-01-02</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, 2014 was another slow year at the <a href="http://monadnock.net/">Monadnock Valley Press</a>, the public-domain website and small-scale publishing house I run on the side. Back in January of last year I <a href="1501.html">changed jobs</a>, so I was just as busy as ever (perhaps even more so).</p>
<p>However, I did manage to eke out a bit of publishing here and there: a bunch of works by <a href="http://monadnock.net/thoreau/">Thoreau</a>, a few related writings by <a href="http://monadnock.net/emerson/">Emerson</a>, the <cite>Last Poems</cite> by <a href="http://monadnock.net/housman/">A.E. Housman</a>, the <cite>Maxims and Reflections</cite> of <a href="http://monadnock.net/goethe/">Goethe</a>, selected poems by <a href="http://monadnock.net/yeats/">William Butler Yeats</a>, and <cite>Pillars of Society</cite> (the first of the great modern prose dramas by <a href="http://monadnock.net/ibsen/">Ibsen</a>).</p>
<p>We also pulled in a grand total of <a href="https://github.com/stpeter/monadnock/blob/master/FINANCE.txt">$312.68 in revenue</a> from our ebooks and print books. That's a 29% increase from 2013, with (as usual) no marketing whatsoever. Perhaps someday we'll actually promote our work. :-)</p>
<p>In 2015 I'm <a href="https://github.com/stpeter/monadnock/blob/master/TODO.txt">planning</a> to republish the second of Ibsen's prose plays (<cite>A Doll's House</cite>), the <cite>Analects</cite> of Confucius, some essays by Montaigne, more works by Emerson and Thoreau, the <cite>Meditations</cite> of Marcus Aurelius, and perhaps a few other works that I haven't considered quite yet. As always, however, I make no promises because my paid employment takes priority...</p>
