<p>Following links from the peripatetic <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a>, I stumbled on the <a href="http://ptypes.pitas.com/">ptypes weblog</a> and associated <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ptypes/">ptypes website</a> devoted to elucidation of personality types. A few years ago I took the Keirsey test and came out ENFP, which the types site categorizes as <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ptypes/paranoid.html">vigilant</a>. About the time I tested ENFP I joined a mailing list for other NFP folks, which was quite interesting for while (though I didn't have time to participate fully). Seems to me there's quite a bit of wisdom and insight to be found in personality types research.</p>
<p>As always I find art (especially music) to be a soothing influence in difficult times. In the days after the terrorist attacks I listened to just about all the keyboard music of Bach, which always helps to clear my mind. Last week and this evening I listened to the complete string quartets of Shostakovich -- beautiful in an angst-ridden way, and peculiarly in tune with these times. Now I've moved on to the complete piano sonatas of Beethoven.</p>
<p>Speaking of the arts, on Saturday night Elisa and I attended a performance of Edmond Rostand's <em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em>. I'd seen a performance of this play (one of my favorites) a number of years ago at the Monmouth Theatre near my hometown in Maine. It's a great play -- high Romanticism that verges on over-the-top but never goes over the line, held together by the character of Cyrano. Saturday's performance used a new and quite fine translation by director <a href="http://www.shakespearesantafe.org/nagle.html">Nagle Jackson</a>; I hope his translation will be published, since it holds up well against the classic but now aging translation by Brian Hooker.</p>
