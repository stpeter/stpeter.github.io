<h2>Security of Person and Property</h2>

    <p>In his book <cite>Equitable Commerce</cite> (1846), Josiah Warren wrote as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Theorists have told us that laws and governments are made for the security of person and property; but it must be evident to most minds, that they never have, never <em>will</em> accomplish this professed object; although they have had all the world at their control for thousands of years, they have brought it to a worse condition than that in which they found it, in spite of the immense improvements in mechanism, division of labor, and other elements of civilization to aid them. On the contrary, under the plausible pretext of <em>securing person and property</em>, they have spread wholesale destruction, famine, and wretchedness, in every frightful form over all parts of the earth, where peace and security might otherwise have prevailed. They have shed more blood, committed more murders, tortures, and other frightful crimes in the struggles against each other <em>for the privilege of governing</em>, than society ever would or could have suffered in the total absence of all governments whatever!</p>
