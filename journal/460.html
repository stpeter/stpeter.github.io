<h2>The Second Vermont Republic</h2>

<p>Only a few American states were once independent nations. Texas and Hawaii come immediately to mind. Another is Vermont; the Vermont Republic was independent from 1777 until 1791, when it voted to join the USA. Now a former professor named Thomas Naylor is <a href="http://timesargus.com/Regional_News/Story/74657.html">advocating</a> the establishment of the <a href="http://www.vermontsovereignty.com/">Second Vermont Republic</a>. More power to him! Here's to a little rebellion now and then:</p>
<blockquote>"The spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions, that I wish it to be always kept alive. It will often be exercised when wrong, but better so than not to be exercised at all. I like a little rebellion now and then. It is like a storm in the atmosphere." --Thomas Jefferson</blockquote>
<blockquote>"God forbid we should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion... We have had thirteen States independent for eleven years. There has been one rebellion. That comes to one rebellion in a century and a half, for each State. What country before ever existed a century and a half without a rebellion?" --Thomas Jefferson</blockquote>
