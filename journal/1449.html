<h2>Attaining Oneness</h2>
<h3>2012-03-03</h3>
<p>Thanks to a recommendation from Michael Serafin, one of the early readers of <a href="http://tao-of-roark.com/">The Tao of Roark</a>, I recently read Derek Lin's translation of the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite>. Because I have no knowledge of classical Chinese, I am at the mercy of translators when it comes to Lao Tzu. Lin's translation is my favorite so far; I especially like his translation of chapter 39, which begins like so...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Those that attained oneness since ancient times:<br>
The sky attained oneness and thus clarity<br>
The earth attained oneness and thus tranquility<br>
The gods attained oneness and thus divinity<br>
The valley attained oneness and thus abundance<br>
The myriad things attained oneness and thus life
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To my mind, these lines are connected to the fourfold human powers that Ayn Rand identified in <cite>The Fountainhead</cite> and that I take as the underlying theme of <cite>The Tao of Roark</cite>. If we understand "oneness" as a kind of integrated realization of each human power, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>realizing the power of thought results in clarity, like the parting of the clouds revealing a cloudless, radiant, uniformly blue sky</li>
<li>realizing the power of choice results in divinity, like the pure spirit and breath (the root of the Greek word psyche) of each sacred individual</li>
<li>realizing the power of action results in abundance and great productivity, "like the fertile valley overflowing with life" as Lin puts it in his commentary</li>
<li>realizing the power of feeling results in tranquility, like the serenity and peace of the earth on a sunny morning</li>
</ul>
<p>I just might need to work these formulations into the final text of <cite>The Tao of Roark</cite> before I publish it as an ebook a few months from now...</p>
