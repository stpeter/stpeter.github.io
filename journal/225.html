<h2>The 80/120 Rule</h2>

<p>DJ Adams <a href="http://www.pipetree.com/qmacro/2002/May/9#80percent">points</a> to an <a href="http://www.nickdenton.org/docs/80_percent_company.mht">essay</a> by Nick Denton on the benefits (yes, even the productivity benefits) of working 80% instead of 120% of the standard work-week. He's even started a <a href="http://www.moreover.com/">company</a> that enforces a four-day work-week. I've long thought that a company with such a policy would clean up in recruiting talented people (well, talneted people who want a life). DJ has arranged things so that he works 80%. I don't think I can do the same -- as a certified <a href="/images/licenseplate.jpg">Jabber fanatic</a>, I'm out on the 120% end of the scale. But Jabber is both work and play for me. (Speaking of Nick's company, it sounds like Jabber integration would be a big plus for his business: real-time content delivery to a web portal is one thing, but real-time content delivery to any connected Jabber device -- desktop, PDA, cell phone, etc. -- is true power.)</p>
