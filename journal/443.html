<h2>NH</h2>

<p>New Hampshire has been chosen by the members of the <a href="https://www.fsp.org/">Free State Project</a> as the destination for 20,000+ liberty-loving individuals to effect <a href="http://www.sunspot.net/news/opinion/bal-ed.free01oct01,0,3962051.story?coll=bal-opinion-headlines">peaceful change</a> through the political process. As I <a href="157.html">mentioned</a> in this space way back in December of 2001, I long ago (1991?) wrote something called "The Monadnock Proposal", which advocated precisely this result. I circulated it only among a few friends, though, and I haven't been able to lay my hands on a copy. Not that it really matters at this point. :-)</p>
<p>This may inspire me to do something productive with my <a href="http://monadnock.net/">monadnock.net</a> domain (Monadnock is a famous mountain in southwestern NH, supposedly the second-most-climbed mountain in the world after Mount Fuji). I've had vague notions about converting the webzine I run there into a full-fledged publishing company, but obviously other commitments have kept me rather busy for the past four years. But that won't be true forever, I'd imagine.</p>
