<h2>Another Bubble Ends</h2>
<h3>2011-07-16</h3>
<p>In today's Washington Examiner, Michael Barone observes that a <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/politics/2011/07/new-reality-emerging-illegal-immigration">new reality is emerging</a> on Mexican immigration into the USA, because the steady flow of recent years has flowed to a trickle. As I <a href="1108.html">posted four years ago</a>, we could've seen this coming because demographics is destiny (and because immigration always declines precipitously during recessions). It's past time for <a href="1157.html">a more rational approach to immigration</a>, but as Barone notes it'll take years for the politicians to catch up to the bursting of the immigration bubble (which in itself is a strong argument for less top-down planning by the public sector and more bottom-up adjusting by the private sector, but more on that some other time).</p>
