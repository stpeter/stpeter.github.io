<h2>Tao Te Ching §2: What-Is and What-Is-Not</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>
</h3>
<h3>2024-08-26</h3>
<p>In my continuing experimentation with the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite>, here's a draft rendering of the second chapter:</p>
<blockquote>
When the world knows what is beautiful<br>
Only as the beautiful<br>
What's ugly comes to be<br>
When the world knows what is good<br>
Only as the good<br>
What's evil comes to be<br>
<br>
What-is gives birth to what-is-not<br>
What-is-not gives birth to what-is<br>
Hard completes easy, easy completes hard<br>
Long measures short, short measures long<br>
High supports low, low supports high<br>
Music tunes voice, voice tunes music<br>
Front follows back, back follows front<br>
<br>
Therefore the sages<br>
Work without doing<br>
Teach without talking<br>
Gain mastery without commanding<br>
Create without possessing<br>
Act without contending<br>
Succeed without flaunting<br>
Thus their success is everlasting
</blockquote>
<p>The poem begins by hinting at the dangers of deifying those who are good and beautiful (the kind of people whom the ancient Greeks called the <em>kalokagathoi</em>): if you insist on seeing only the good in someone (say, the ruler of your country) then you won't be open to clear-eyed perception (say, legitimate questioning of authority). This idea is generalized and extended into some profound paradoxes that are well worth contemplating in their bidirectional glory. And, as always, Lao Tzu brings it all back to practical insights that point toward a more sagacious way of life...</p>
