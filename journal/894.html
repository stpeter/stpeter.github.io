<h2>Personal Productivity</h2>
<h3>2006-03-10</h3>
    <p>Productivity matters, both <a href="882.html">for nations</a> and for individuals (national productivity is just the sum of the productivity of the individuals living there). Lately I've been feeling a pressing need to become more personally productive. Partly it's that I'm <a href="884.html">overwhelmed with work</a>. There is so much to do, my email inbox is growing daily, I'm in IM conversations all day long, more and more people want to do stuff with <a href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a> and it's hard to service them all, and there are many XMPP extensions that I need to solidify because, well, I'm the guy who writes the docs (yes, "I write the specs that make the whole world sing"). So I've started to look into productivity tools and, especially, changes to my work habits. Unfortunately I know that behavior changes will require me to <a href="http://www.dexterity.com/articles/get-more-done.htm">keep careful track of my time</a> and <a href="http://www.marktaw.com/blog/GettingBackToWork.html">all that</a>, but I suppose there's no avoiding it. Sigh.</p>
