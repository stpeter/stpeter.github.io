<h2>Mudita</h2>
<h3>2003-01-10</h3>
<p>My friend Joshua Zader has started blogging, and the name of his weblog is <a href="http://zader.com/mudita/">Mudita Journal</a>. The word 'mudita' is a Pali word describing a key concept from Buddhism; Joshua <a href="http://www.zader.com/mudita/archives/000007.html">defines it</a> as "a state of sympathetic joy" or "happiness at another's success in life". It is thus the precise opposite of the German term Schadenfreude ("happiness at another's misfortune"). Joshua's journal is almost a month old now, but I've just started reading it since I was awfully busy in December and then AFK (away from keyboard) for almost two weeks. So far it looks like good reading -- and I don't say that merely because he <a href="http://www.zader.com/mudita/archives/000037.html">has written</a> about one of my journal entries.</p>
