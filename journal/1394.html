<h2>Deep or Wide?</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>

<h3>2010-01-03</h3>
<p>At my favorite library the other day I picked up Julie Rose's recent translation of <cite>Les Misérables</cite>. As <a href="1310.html">previously mentioned</a>, to date I have read only the translation by Norman Denny, but I can envision over time reading most or all of the English translations -- in part because translators can't be trusted (I know, because I'm a translator myself) but mostly because I like to explore in depth the works of art that I love: I own seven recordings of Bach's Cello Suites, when at the Frick Collection in New York I <a href="516.html">find myself absorbed</a> by Van Dyck's portrait of Frans Snyder, I don't read a lot of novels but I've plowed through <cite>Les Misérables</cite> and <cite>The Fountainhead</cite> and a few others numerous times, et cetera. Somewhere in <cite>Daybreak</cite> or <cite>Human, All Too Human</cite> or <cite>La Gaya Scienza</cite>, Nietzsche talks about the propensity of certain personality types to dive into the depths rather than to float widely on the surface of things, and I think I fall into the deep-diving category. Whether that's always healthy or good, I'm not sure...</p>
