<h2>Friendship in Atlas Shrugged</h2>
<h3>2005-03-13</h3>
<p>The other night I finished the first draft of an essay entitled "Friendship in Atlas Shrugged", which I've promised to Ed Younkins for a collection he's editing for publication in 2007 (the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of Ayn Rand's magnum opus). The collection is tentatively entitled <cite>Atlas Shrugged: A Philosophical and Literary Companion</cite> and it appears that the good people at <a href="http://www.ashgate.com/">Ashgate Press</a> have agreed to publish it. If you really want to read this essay and comment on it so that I can improve it before publication, do let me know.</p>
