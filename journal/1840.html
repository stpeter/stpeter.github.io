<h2>Do We Need the Concept of a Concept?</h2>

<p>As mentioned last month, I'm slowly re-reading Robert Sokolowski's book <cite>Phenomenology of the Human Person</cite> with a friend of mine. When I first wrote about this book four years ago, I noted that Sokolowski "explains the epistemology of reason in the context of human conversation: by embracing the back and forth of speech ... he sidesteps the ever present dangers of solipsism and mental representationalism." As a point of comparison, in her book <cite>Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology</cite>, Ayn Rand says that a child independently formulates the concept of, say, a tree in his or her own mind by observing trees in reality. However, on this account we need to add communication as a separate capacity on top of concept-formation so that we can explain how the child associates the word 'tree' with the concept.</p>
<p>By contrast, Sokolowski says that we English-speakers simply use the word 'tree' to talk about the trees we encounter and the child naturally learns to use the word because that's what other English-speakers say. As a result, we don't need the concept of a concept, which is merely another kind of mental representation - and, according to Sokolowski, such representations don't exist. Thus philosophical parsimony might lead us to strike concepts from our talk about how we understand what we know. I see quite a bit of sense in what he says, so I've been trying the idea on for size.</p>
<p>Ironically, Sokolowski goes on say that words serve to focus the mind on reality, yet it seems to me this assumes that somehow there is a <em>thing</em> called the mind inside us - and I've previously noted that I have my doubts about that position.</p>
<p>Yes, reification is hard to avoid...</p>
