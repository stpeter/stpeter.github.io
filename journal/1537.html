<h2>RFC 7673: DNSSEC, DANE, and SRV</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>

<h3>2015-10-14</h3>
<p>Traditionally, connections to Internet services such as websites are secured using SSL/TLS with digital certificates issued by third-party certification authorities. Because this dependency on CAs isn't always a good thing (can you say Diginotar?), building atop <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc4033/">DNSSEC</a> some smart folks at the IETF designed <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6698/">DANE</a> as a way for application service providers to specify their own keying material. This works just fine for protocols like HTTP in which a client to look up a server "directly" using DNS A or AAAA records. However, it doesn't work for protocols like IMAP or XMPP in which a client uses DNS SRV records to find the server to which it will ultimately connect. Because we care about this scenario in the Jabber/XMPP community, Matt Miller and I volunteered to help Tony Finch finish his initial work to fill this gap. The resulting document was published today as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7673/">RFC 7673</a>. Security FTW!</p>
