<h2>The Free State?</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>

<h3>2008-01-09</h3>
<p>Many things could be said about Ron Paul's bid for the presidency, from his exclusion from a recent debate by Fox News ("fair and balanced"?) to the recent brouhaha over racist statements made in newsletters published under his name 15 years ago. I may find time to post further about these matters as well as my take on the Paul phenomenon. But one thing struck me last night: Paul received 10% of the vote in Iowa but only 8% in New Hampshire. Yet New Hampshire was chosen by the <a href="https://www.fsp.org/">Free State Project</a> as <em>the</em> place in America that would be most receptive to libertarian ideas and political action. What gives? Free state indeed!</p>
<p>UPDATE: Free State Project founder Jason Sorens has <a href="https://www.fsp.org/node/2572">analyzed the results</a>.</p>
<p>UPDATE 2008-02-03: Ron Paul got <a href="http://pressherald.mainetoday.com/story.php?id=167034">19% in my home state of Maine</a>, 11% more than in New Hampshire. Interesting.</p>
