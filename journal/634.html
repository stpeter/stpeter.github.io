<h2>Audiences</h2>
<h3>2004-12-02</h3>
    <p>I was talking on the phone the other day with an old friend who happens to read my weblog. I found it amusing when he said that he pretty much skips over all my posts on techie topics like Jabber protocols, the IETF, and Internet security (knowing him, though, he probably devours my posts on music, philosophy, and history). By the same token, I'm sure there are people who couldn't care less about my philosophical or political opinions and would prefer that I stick to talking tech. That set me to thinking about how many audiences there are for this blog of mine. Is there a straight, two-cultures division here (science vs. art, technology vs. the humanities, and all that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.P._Snow">C.P. Snow</a> kind of thing)? Am I weird for being a protocol geek by day and an amateur musician, poet, philosopher, and historian by night?</p>
