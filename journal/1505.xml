<header><title>Nietzsche's Poetic Effects</title><date>2014-03-22</date></header>
<entry>
<p>I have not yet begun to grapple with how I will write <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite>, a cycle of philosophical poems about the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche. The prospect is daunting in many ways at once, like climbing a high mountain in winter.</p>
<p>As I study and contemplate various paths to the top, I keep noticing interesting features along the way. One is a certain metrical freedom that Nietzsche exercises in his own poetry (which sadly is not much appreciated). Consider a few of his shorter poems:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Für Tänzer</strong>
<br/><br/>
Glattes eis<br/>
Ein paradeis<br/>
Für den, der gut zu tanzen weiß.
</blockquote>
<p>and:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Zuspruch</strong>
<br/><br/>
Auf Ruhm hast du den Sinn gericht<br/>
Dann acht der Lehre<br/>
Beizeiten leiste frei Verzicht<br/>
Auf Ehre!
</blockquote>
<p>One doesn't need to know German to see the playful rhythmic patterns Nietzsche employs here.</p>
<p>Interestingly, famed Nietzsche translator Walter Kaufmann does the same in some of his own poems...</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Dream</strong>
<br/><br/>
To write granite verse and prose<br/>
polished hard simple and<br/>
dazzling as a sphinx with a broken nose<br/>
in endless sand.
<br/><br/>
No passing image of what<br/>
is no matter<br/>
but a presence time can not<br/>
shatter.
</blockquote>
<p>So does my friend <a href='https://john-j-enright.livejournal.com/'>John Enright</a>, whose poems I have always loved (and who turned me on to Walter Kaufmann's poetry)...</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Philosophy and Poetry</strong>
<br/><br/>
Ironic turns of mind<br/>
Combined<br/>
Into a mask of common sense -
<br/><br/>
This is my defense.<br/>
My crime<br/>
Is rhyme.
</blockquote>
<p>Although I wouldn't call this free verse (especially given its prominent rhymes), it does have a great freedom. It's definitely a poetic effect that I shall incorporate into <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite>.</p>
