<p>Just a quick note to say that I now consider my <a href='/writings/epicurus/'>Epicurean dialogue on happiness</a> to be finished, thus completing a journey of exploration that <a href='1259.html'>began five years ago</a> when, thanks to my friend Manuel, I decided to start translating the ethical writings of Epicurus (although in fact I have been interested in Epicurus ever since I read and <a href='/writings/rand/epicurus.html'>responded to</a> Ray Shelton's paper "Epicurus and Rand" back in 1997).</p>
<p>It always feels great to conclude a big project -- especially one that has brought me closer to true wisdom about life. As Howard Roark says in <cite>The Fountainhead</cite>, this is a point reached. But I'm not standing still, because I'm already hard at work on the next two projects in my series of books on the philosophy of happiness: they are code named <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite> and <cite>Walking with Thoreau</cite>.</p>
<p>In closing this chapter of my intellectual history, I find it appropriate to quote from the <a href='http://www.monadnock.net/epicurus/letter.html'>letter</a> that Epicurus wrote to his friend Menoikos some 2300 years ago:</p>
<blockquote>Let no one put off the love and practice of wisdom when young, nor grow tired of it when old. For it is never too early or too late for the health of the soul. Someone who says that the time to love and practice wisdom has not yet come or has passed is like someone who says that the time for happiness has not yet come or has passed. Young or old, it is necessary to love and practice wisdom, so that in old age you can be youthful by taking joy in the good things you remember, and likewise in youth you can be mature by not fearing what will come. Reflect on what brings happiness, because if you have that you have everything, but if not you will do everything to attain it.</blockquote>
<p>Although I'll continue to ponder and absorb the wisdom of Epicurus in the years ahead, I'm now moving along to working actively on Nietzsche and Thoreau (and, after that, Aristotle). As always I'll be certain to share whatever of value I find in this continuing voyage of discovery...</p>
