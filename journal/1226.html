<h2>The Tao of Roark: The Theme</h2>

<h3>2008-05-02</h3>
<p>As promised, I am slowly working on a book entitled <a href="/writings/roark/">The Tao of Roark</a>. Although the official subtitle will be "Reflections on the Fountainhead", in my mind I often think of this project as "The Rosenbaum Variations" (Rand's family name was Rosenbaum) -- I may even structure the book as a theme and variations, along the lines of Bach's Goldberg's Variations. The only chapter I've completed so far is the preface, which introduces the theme of the book. I'll post more chapters as I complete them.</p>
