<p>For my recent trip to Brussels I was casting about for a large book to read and settled on <cite>Les Misérables</cite> by Victor Hugo (as translated by Norman Denny). Along with Yevgeny Zamyatin's <cite>WE</cite>, Anne Holm's <cite>I Am David</cite> (also published under the title <cite>North to Freedom</cite>), and the novels of Ayn Rand, I think <cite>Les Miserables</cite> may be the only novel I've read more than three times. I'm really enjoying it, though perhaps next time I'll try a different translation just to mix things up a bit. :)</p>
