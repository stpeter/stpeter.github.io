<h2>My Type, Again</h2>

<h3>2002-04-21</h3>
<p>For various reasons, I've been reading up a bit lately on personality types (you know, Myers-Briggs and all that). Several years ago I took the Keirsey test and came out definitely NFP (iNtuitive Feeling Perceiving as opposed to Sensory Thinking Judging), and borderline on the Introverted/Extraverted dimension. I think I'm probably by nature introverted -- even into my early twenties I was painfully shy -- but that I've learned over time to become more extraverted. In any case I've found some good descriptions of both the INFP (<a href="http://www.personalitypage.com/INFP.html">1</a> | <a href="http://keirsey.com/personality/nfip.html">2</a> | <a href="http://www.insightsystem.com/infp.htm">3</a>) and ENFP (<a href="http://www.personalitypage.com/ENFP.html">1</a> | <a href="http://keirsey.com/personality/nfep.html">2</a> | <a href="http://www.insightsystem.com/enfp.htm">3</a>) personality types, in which I can definitely see aspects of myself.</p>
<p>With regard to their work, INFPs <a href="http://www.personalitypage.com/INFP_car.html">tend</a> to most enjoy a career that is not just a job but a passion or crusade, and I definitely bring that to my work with <a href="https://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a> (that's one reason people call me the "patron saint" of Jabber, I suppose, since I bring an almost evangelical fervor to the technology). And ENFPs <a href="http://www.personalitypage.com/ENFP_car.html">tend</a> not to be detail-oriented and to have a hard time finishing projects, which unfortunately I must admit is true of me. ENFPs also tend to have good diplomatic skills and often are able to translate technical ideas into plain English (and vice-versa), which are strengths of mine. INFPs often express themselves best through writing, and supposedly most of the world's great writers have been INFPs. Not that I'm a <em>great</em> writer, but writing does come easily to me and it's one of the things I do best. So I see a lot of *NFP in me, for better or for worse. :)</p>
