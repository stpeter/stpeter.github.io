<h2>The Goods</h2>
<h3>2006-02-09</h3>
    <p>Because of some cartoons representing Mohammed that were published in a Danish newspaper, people in various Islamic countries are (at their most peaceful) boycotting Danish goods. Unfortunately, those of us who care about freedom of speech can't boycott products from said Islamic countries because they don't produce anything (well, sure, they sell oil, but that's a commodity, not a product). Wouldn't it be something if all those Muslims who are burning Danish flags (where do they get them on such short notice?), storming Scandanavian embassies, and removing Danish products from Islamic stores were to join the market economy and produce something that people in other countries might want to buy?</p>
