<p>Back in May, Discourse magazine published a fine essay by Martin Gurri entitled "My Moral Sphere". Consistent with my own stance toward life, Gurri argued that ethics is not what you profess about national or global issues, but how you treat the people around you. Here's his summary:</p>
<blockquote>My moral sphere is a small world, a limited space. The necessary virtues aren't complex: <em>humility</em> with my family, <em>integrity</em> at work, <em>neighborliness</em> in my community - add <em>loyalty</em> to friends, and one has the basic package.</blockquote>
<p>Although I might modify or expand his list, the core focus seems right to me. My moral sphere is a <em>personal world</em>, filled with individuals whom I endeavor to treat with dignity, respect, kindness, and love. It sounds so simple, yet anyone who has had to deal with a disruptive neighbor, backstabbing co-worker, abusive family member, or false friend knows that the personal world is the hardest of all.</p>
