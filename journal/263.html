<h2>Prescience or Senescence?</h2>
<h3>2002-07-17</h3>
<p>Wired is <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,53815,00.html">reporting</a> that blogging helps Alzheimer's patients cope with their affliction; among other things it helps them "recall tasks completed and milestones past". And here I thought I was the only one who used a weblog as a glorified filing system! I definitely find that writing things down helps me remember them, and I can always grep through the XML source files to find what I'm looking for. I guess I'm "ahead of my time", as it were -- either that, or I'm facing the early onset of Alzheimer's.... :)</p>
