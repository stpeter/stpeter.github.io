<h2>Heir-less</h2>
<h3>2002-05-16</h3>
<p>Got an email the other day from <a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/~hardy/">Michael Hardy</a> regarding a <a href="40.html">journal entry</a> I made in 1998. Michael (who was an active poster -- as I was -- back in the old days of the now-defunct <a href="http://www.vix.com/objectivism/mail-lists.html#MDOP">MDOP</a> mailing list) points out that there is no evidence that Leonard Peikoff was ever anointed by Ayn Rand as her intellectual heir. This claim is thus probably a mere assertion on Peikoff's part. Not that the notion of an "intellectual heir" is legitimate, since it assumes that a philosophy is a kind of intellectual property that can be deeded to a single person like a house or physical estate. And that assumption does violence to the very nature of ideas. But it's just like Peikoff to claim that a philosophy is a closed system over which property rights can be asserted. Those Randians are weird.</p>
