<h2>Music of Hawaii</h2>
<h3>2003-10-06</h3>
<p>The other day I checked George Winston's CD <cite>Plains</cite> out of the library. The two most haunting pieces on this disc come from Hawaii: a traditional tune called "No Ke Ano Ahiahi" and one entitled "Ike Ia Ladana" composed by Hawaii's Queen Liliuokalani in 1887. Winston is devoted to the tradition of Hawaiian slack key guitar, and if these two pieces are a representative sample then I think I need to check into the tradition further. His favorite interpreters are Dennis Kamakahi, Keola Beamer, and Ozzie Kotani, as well as Gabby and Cyril Pahinui. So much music to explore in this world...</p>
<p>(And yes, I still support the cause of <a href="http://hawaii-nation.org">Hawaiian independence</a>.)</p>
