<h2>Desert Island Redux</h2>

<h3>2004-07-31</h3>
    <p>Because of a special deal that Apple is running right now, my new PowerBook came with an iPod (that's a really sweet, portable music player for you non-techno-geeks). The thing has "only" 20 gigs of storage (compared to the 20 megabyte capacity of my first hard drive, at about one-twentieth of the size -- progress in storage capacity is even more amazing to me than progress in processor speed). So I figure this thing will hold about 100 CDs' worth of music. Back in January I <a href="481.html">tried but failed</a> to come up with a list of only 10 "desert island discs", but the prospect of whittling my CD collection down to only 100 CDs is less daunting -- in fact, it's forcing me to recognize which music I like best and which is nonessential in my life. Perhaps I'll post again with my top 100 (I wonder if iTunes has an export function?).</p>
