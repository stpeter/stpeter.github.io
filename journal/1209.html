<h2>The Road From Damascus</h2>

<p>Did we really need to declare war on Iraq or even Afghanistan in order take out the criminals who perpetrated the 9/11 attacks and other acts of terror? I wonder. Today came news that psychopath <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/953927.html">Imad Mughniyeh</a> of Hizbullah has been killed by a car bomb in Damascus. Yes, Damascus -- capital city of Syria, supposed member of the axis of evil, and a land eminently not occupied by the armed forces of the U.S. government. As an Israeli commando says in <a href="http://www.janes.com/security/international_security/news/fr/fr010919_1_n.shtml">this Jane's article</a>, "To fight these bastards you don’t need a military attack. You only need to adopt Israel’s assassination policy."</p>
