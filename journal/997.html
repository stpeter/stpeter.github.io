<h2>Dawn For Governor</h2>
<h3>2006-09-14</h3>
    <p>Boy, is the race for governor of Colorado depressing. On the right we have <a href="http://www.beauprezforgovernor.com/">Bob Beauprez</a>, an anti-choice, big-government Republican. On the left we have <a href="http://www.ritterforgovernor.com/">Bill Ritter</a>, an anti-choice, big-government Democrat. That's right, the Democrats and Republicans have given us two anti-choice, big-government candidates!</p>
    <p>But all is not lost, because over here in the radical center we have <a href="http://www.dawnforgovernor.org/">Dawn Winkler</a>, the only candidate who reflects the Western heritage of smaller government, individual choice, and personal responsibility. And the people of Colorado are starting to pay attention, because with almost no media coverage she is <a href="http://lpcolorado.blogs.com/lpcolorado/2006/09/libertarian_gub.html">running around 8% in the polls</a>. Plus she's blogging and speaking in her own voice, not that of some PR agency.</p>
    <p>If you ask me, it's time for a new Dawn in Colorado politics. :-)</p>
