<h2><a href="1877.html">Walking with Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics III.10-12</a></h2>
<h3>2024-07-02</h3>
<p>After his discussion of courage, Aristotle moves immediately to another of the traditional four virtues in ancient Greece: moderation. Although Aristotle never said that we should pursue moderation in everything, he did think that moderation is crucial to human fulfillment. Among other considerations, courage is paradigmatically displayed in war, but we engage in war only for the sake of peace; thus we need to understand and practice the character traits that maintain peace, among which moderation plays a central role.</p>
<p>The Greek word rendered here as 'moderation' is σωφροσύνη, which is notoriously difficult to translate (there's a whole book on the topic by Helen North, which of course I've read in my copious research into Aristotle's ethics). Following his usual procedure of attempting to identify the primary cases, Aristotle settles on situations in which human beings are drawn to bodily pleasures that we have in common with other animals, especially those that involve the senses of taste or touch. As he says, we don't call someone immoderate or decadent (ἀκόλαστος) if they have a passion for listening to music or viewing beautiful artworks, but we do if they are overly attached to eating, drinking, or sex. Similar reasoning applies to, say, a passion for honor or for learning; in such domains, the enjoyment is more mental than physical.</p>
<p>As with all character traits, the thriving or excellence lies somewhere between behaviors that fall short and those that go too far: here, moderation is intermediate between an admittedly rare insensitivity to bodily pleasures and an all-too-human tendency to indulgence. We are naturally geared to seek pleasure, which is why leading a more moderate, temperate life is a positive achievement. That life consists in feeling and acting in ways that are consistent with bodily health, good physical condition, reasonable expense, and - as always - that aim at what is beautifully right.</p>
<p>By contrast, the person who succumbs to decadence essentially has a policy of greedily grabbing every pleasure that comes his way (even if they are repulsively wrong) and is downright pained by a lack of constant titillation. In this fashion, the decadent person destroys the harmony that should naturally obtain between reason and desire - he literally loses his mind, since etymologically sōphrosunē means to preserve one's capacity to think and be mindful.</p>
<p>Both courage and moderation deal fundamentally with enjoyable and distressful emotions: fear and hope in the case of courage, bodily gratification in the case of moderation. From here, in Book IV Aristotle will progress to excellences of character that focus primarily on admirably appropriate actions, such as generosity and kindness. We'll look at those in our next installment of walking with Aristotle.</p>

<h2><a href="1876.html">Varieties of Courage</a></h2>
<h3>2024-06-23</h3>
<p>In my post the other day about Aristotle's discussion of courage, I neglected to mention the restricted reference of his definition: roughly speaking, he says that the character trait of courage enables you to feel the appropriate level of fear and confidence when confronted with the possibility of dying in battle. It's true that he does mention other varieties of courage, since you can be brave when you might lose anything you hold valuable, such as your health (e.g., when diagnosed with a dread disease) or social status (e.g., when speaking out against injustice); yet he says that these varieties are merely analogous to the core or "focal" sense of the term.</p>
<p>We moderns can find this approach disconcerting, for we often try to formulate the most comprehensive definition covering the widest range of cases. By contrast, Aristotle usually works to identify the primary instance of a phenomenon, and then treats all the other instances as analogous to the paradigm. In practice this might be a distinction without a difference, but it's important to keep it in mind as we work our way through Aristotle's <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>.</p>

<h2><a href="1875.html">Walking with Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics III.6-9</a></h2>
<h3>2024-06-21</h3>
<p>The first thriving of character that Aristotle discusses at length is courage. Why?</p>
<p>To start with, we mustn't forget the cultural and historical context: that of small city-states plagued by endemic warfare (e.g., Athens and Megara, 40km apart, were in conflict on and off for centuries). For good reason, the Greek word ἀνδρεία means both courage and manliness: if the menfolk did not demonstrate bravery in battle, a town could be destroyed, with the men likely killed and the women and children sold into slavery. For the ancients, courage was serious business.</p>
<p>More fundamentally, courage illustrates a number key points that Aristotle wishes to make about human character:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Because it is possible not only to fall short of "hitting the target" in human behavior but also to overshoot it, an excellence of character has not one opposite, but two. For instance, courage is opposed not only to cowardice but also to rashness.</li>
  <li>Human beings thrive not only in their actions but also in their feelings and emotions. For instance, true courage isn't merely a matter of acting bravely but also of experiencing the right amounts of fear and confidence in threatening situations. Indeed, the courageous person faces even the risk of a noble death with a feeling of tranquility, at least within human limits (there are certain dangers that no one should be expected to face without disturbance).</li>
  <li>Behaviors come with reasons and thoughts and accounts attached, and those matter. For instance, it's not true courage if you appear to act bravely merely because you want to avoid a court-martial, or because you're forced to do so, or because you're so experienced that nothing fazes you, or because you're naturally high-spirited, or because you have unrealistic levels of self-confidence, or because you're totally oblivious to the dangers you face.</li>
  <li>The correct reason or thought or account (ὀρθός λόγος) for an action-plus-feeling is that it is the beautifully right (καλός) thing to do, or that not to do it would be repulsively wrong (αἰσχρός). Yes, these phrases are charged with ethical and aesthetic significance, because that's how Aristotle sees the realm of human affairs.</li>
  <li>For the person of good character who takes life seriously (and who by that very fact has strong reasons for loving their own existence), the prospect of losing their life in battle is far from pleasant; yet even this can be enjoyable <em>in a way</em>, if one is committed to and stays focused on the purpose or completion (τέλος) of the activity (ἐνέργεια), i.e., on doing what is beautifully right.</li>
  <li>The purpose or completion of an activity is directed by the relevant character trait (κατὰ τὴν ἕξιν), which means it is also directed by the commitments and thought processes underlying that trait, since (as we will see in Book VI) it is not possible to be completely good without also having attained some measure of wisdom (φρόνησις). Moreover, acquiring a trait involves not only wisdom but also deep commitment (προαίρεσις) and, as he says at the end of III.2, "commitment is accompanied by an account (μετὰ λόγου) and by thinking things through (διάνοια)".</li>
</ul>
<p>That's a lot to squeeze into three short chapters! We'll see Aristotle build upon these insights as he works his way through the other virtues, starting in III.10-12 with moderation.</p>

<h2><a href="1874.html">Liberty</a></h2>
<h3>2024-06-20</h3>
<p>Here are a few more thoughts on unalienable rights. In his 1748 book <cite>The Spirit of the Laws</cite> (which greatly influenced the American Founders), Montesquieu wrote:</p>
<blockquote>There is no word that admits of more various significations, and has made more different impressions on the human mind, than that of <em>liberty</em>.</blockquote>
<p>Montesquieu goes on to distinguish two primary senses of what he calls political liberty:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Constitutional liberty arises from well-defined limits on the functions of government and on the people who exercise those functions (e.g., through the separation of powers across the legislative, executive, and judicial branches).</li>
  <li>Personal liberty is the individual's sense of safety and tranquility in society, especially security against arbitrary attacks and accusations under the law (e.g., prosecution for what today we would call thought crimes).</li>
</ol>
<p>Constitutional liberty and personal liberty are two sides of the same coin, i.e., of political liberty; together, they protect and reinforce what he calls philosophical liberty, i.e., the free exercise of the will in thought and action.</p>
<p>At least, such is my reading. Even this brief overview suggests that liberty provides a connecting link between life and the pursuit of happiness, because life is activity (as Aristotle said) and the pursuit of happiness depends on freedom of thought and action.</p>

<h2><a href="1873.html">Unalienable Rights</a></h2>
<h3>2024-06-16</h3>
<p>Thinking recently about brotherhood and pluralism in an American context spurred me to reflect on the American creed expressed so succinctly in the Declaration of Independence:</p>
<blockquote>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</blockquote>
<p>But what makes a certain right <em>unalienable</em>? And are other rights <em>alienable</em>?</p>
<p>Apparently the distinction between alienable and unalienable rights was first drawn by Francis Hutcheson in his <cite>Inquiry into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue</cite> (1725), where he asserted that a right is alienable (literally, "otherable") only if it meets two conditions: (1) "If the Alienation be within our natural Power, so that it be possible for us in Fact to transfer our Right." (2) "It must appear, that to transfer such Rights may serve some valuable Purpose."</p>
<p>For example, your right to a legitimately acquired piece of property is <em>alienable</em>, since if you sell the property to me then by that very act you transfer the right over to me.</p>
<p>By contrast, consider the rights proclaimed by the Declaration:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your right to your own life is <em>unalienable</em> because you can't sell yourself into slavery, nor would there ever be a "valuable purpose" in doing so.</li>
<li>On some construals, your right to liberty (e.g., liberty of thought, judgment, feeling, opinion, belief) is also unalienable because it's impossible for someone else to think or judge or feel or form opinions or beliefs for you - these are inherently capacities and activities of individuals.</li>
<li>Similarly, you are the only person who can pursue your own happiness and fulfillment in life - it's not within anyone else's power to do that even though we are social beings, for happiness and fulfillment are in large measure constituted by the pursuit itself. Thus this right is unalienable, too.</li>
</ol>
<p>To my mind, it's significant that all three of these unalienable rights are broadly grounded in a conception of human personhood and human action. Although that conception is not uniquely American (since its sources include British law, Christian religion, Enlightenment thinking, ancient history, and classical philosophy), it was uniquely expressed in the ideals of the American founding and thus perhaps can still strengthen the ties that bind Americans together, both today and in the future.</p>

<h2><a href="1872.html">Persuasion vs. Power</a></h2>
<h3>2024-06-14</h3>
<p>In my post about pluralism the other day, I mentioned in passing a crucial proviso: those who wish to force their positions on the rest of us have thereby placed themselves outside what Michael Oakeshott called the human conversation.</p>
<p>I don't mean to idealize human relations. Every society lies somewhere on a continuum from pure power to pure persuasion, with thoroughgoing totalitarianism on one end and perhaps small-scale hunter-gatherer bands on the other end. Yet when it comes to matters of conscience and belief, I see no place for power; this is the realm of persuasion plain and simple.</p>
<p>It's true that persuasion requires both time and patience. That's why most revolutionaries have no time for time and no patience for patience: society must be overhauled from the ground up, and right now!</p>
<p>Power and persuasion are polar opposites, which is why it's so dangerous to equate the two. As we've seen with the recent college protests (starting at my alma mater Columbia University), when silence is violence then violence becomes speech. It's especially troubling and telling that this transformation has happened at institutions which for centuries were bastions of free inquiry. In the face of this deep moral and intellectual disintegration, the best we can do as individuals is to rededicate ourselves to persuasion in our own lives.</p>
