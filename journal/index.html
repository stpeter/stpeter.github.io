<h2><a href="1685.html">Meditations on Bach #9: Musical Monadology</a></h2>
<h3>2021-12-26</h3>
<p>In meditation #7 of this series, I took note of some similarities between the aesthetics of Aristotle and the music of Bach. Another intriguing influence might be the monadology of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716), who directly influenced philosophers and musical theorists in the Bach's orbit: for instance, Bach's student Lorenz Mizler (1711-1778) was a follower of the Leibniz scholar Christian Wolff (1679-1754). In chapter 5 of his book <cite>Music in the Culture of the Renassiance and Other Essays</cite>, Edward Lowinsky makes the following observations:</p>
<blockquote>The surging melody conceals the motivic form of the substructure. This motivic form is one of the essential aspects of Bach's musical organism. The prototype of Bach's music, the fugue, reveals the relationship between the part and whole, the fugal subject and the fugal form.... [E]ven in the free form of the prelude, the closest relationship exists between the smallest part and the whole.... But we might be closest to the truth if we say that the whole and the parts, including the smallest elements, the motives, are inseperable and are in constant musical influence upon each other. Bach's music may be viewed as a perfect symbol of the universe as seen by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, a universe formed by Monads, which are defined as simple, individuated, energetic sustances in a constant flx of activity and change, related to other Monads through a preestablished harmony. In this picture of the universe the Monad stands for the motive, the preestablished harmony for the vision of the whole. A Bach motive can indeed be defined in terms of a Leibniz Monad, whose main attribute is force and energy; it is constantly active and variable, but in the nature of its action and change it follows its own inner principle; the Monad is a mirror of the whole, even as the whole consists of the Monads. Yet, each Monad mirrors the whole, the universe, in its own individual fashion, so that the immense order and harmony of the universe is accompanied by infinite variety. In a Bach fugue we find the most perfect order together with the greatest possible variety. The fugal subject is as once identical throughout and variable throughout. It appears in constantly varying pitches, keys, shapes, time forms, and directions. Yet, it never loses its identity.</blockquote>
<p>This notion of unity in variety is what Bach and his followers called musical perfection. It is well summarized by John Butt in his paper "'A mind unconscious that it is calculating?' Bach and the rationalist philosophy of Wolff, Leibniz, and Spinoza", published in <cite>The Cambridge Companion to Bach</cite>, p. 64:</p>
<blockquote>The formula he [Leibniz] offers in the <cite>Monadology</cite> (1714) for God's creative may well work as an ideal summary of Bach's approach to composition: "[the differing] perspectives of a sinble universe in accordance with the different points of view of each monad ... is the means of obtaining as much variety as possible; that is to say, it is the means of obtaining as much perfection as possible" (<cite>Monadology</cite>, paragraphs 57-8).</blockquote>
<p>As far as I can see this is not idle speculation, since it plays out in every measure of Bach's music.  Laurence Dreyfus plumbs the depths of these matters, albeit at a purely musical level (leaving aside all philosophical speculation), in his book <cite>Bach and the Patterns of Invention</cite>. In future meditations I'll have more to say about those patterns of invention within the Bach Cello Suites.</p>
<p>P.S. It might not be accidental that this is post #1685 in my online journal, since Bach was born in the year 1685...</p>

<h2><a href="1684.html">A Friend by Any Other Name</a></h2>
<h3>2021-12-19</h3>
<p>It is said that when the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus died, he left behind thousands of friends. This was 2300 years before Facebook, so how could he have befriended so many people?</p>
<p>I suspect that most of them were not dear friends (it's impossible to be close to that many people) but instead students or followers; yet he seems to have referred to them as friends because friendship or φιλία was core to his philosophy of life. Perhaps also he did not differentiate strongly between the teacher-student relationship and the friend-friend relationship. See for example the very end of his <cite>Letter to Menoikeus</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>So practice these and similar things day and night, by yourself and with a like-minded friend, and you will never be disturbed whether waking or sleeping, and you will live as a god among men: for a man who lives in the midst of immortal goods is unlike a merely mortal being.</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, we find something similar in the Confucian tradition. Consider this quote from Book VII of the <cite>Analects</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>The Master said, "When I walk along with two others, they may serve me as my teachers. I will select their good qualities and follow them, their bad qualities and avoid them."</blockquote>
<p>The Neo-Confucians held similar views; a good example is Wu Yubi, a Confucian teacher who lived in the 1400s (cf. M. Theresa Kelleher, <cite>The Journal of Wu Yubi</cite>, p. 156).</p>
<p>For some months I've been pondering the many pairs of terms we use for relationships that can involve ethical or psychological authority: therapist-patient, counselor-client, teacher-student, mentor-youth, coach-protege, minister-layman, priest-parishioner, prophet-disciple, guru-seeker, guide-traveller, leader-follower, expert-beginner, parent-child, etc. In the recent tradition of philosophical counseling, certain providers try to avoid such terms entirely; for instance, Gerd Achenbach, who started a philosophical practice at Köln Germany way back in 1981, says that he is merely a host and the people who visit him are his guests. This is broadly consistent with the "philosophical midwifery" that Socrates practiced - for he, too, called his interlocutors friends, not students, disciples, followers, patients, or clients.</p>
<p>Naturally, it's one thing to use neutral, non-authoritarian terminology, and perhaps quite another to foster an egalitarian relationship or environment between two people when one of them might be considered more knowledgeable or experienced. For instance, the latter is decidedly my intent when I mentor people; although I think that I mostly succeed, I can't be certain that I always do...</p>

<h2><a href="1683.html">Aristotle Research Report #17: Let the Re-Reading Begin</a></h2>
<h3>2021-11-28</h3>
<p>Just under two years ago, I thought I was done with phase one of my research into Aristotle's views o human flourishing, having at that point read around 120 distinct works by or related to Aristotle (including all of Plato's dialogues). Well, I was wrong: since then I've read an additional 150 works, almost exclusively in the scholarly literature on Aristotle. Now I have three whole shelves of books about Aristotle in my office.</p>
<p><img src="/images/aristotle-1a.jpg"></p>
<p>At this point I'm finally ready to begin the process of re-reading - or, to be precise, going over the many passages that I've marked up in these works, organizing the material along topical lines, identifying key themes, and coming to conclusions about the nature and value of Aristotle's insights. But first I think I'll take a break for a few months!</p>

<h2><a href="1682.html">Philosophy vs. Ideology</a></h2>
<h3>2021-11-04</h3>
<p>Today I'd like to explore some implications of my recent series of posts about the nature of opinion; specifically, the dangers of ideology. (As a reminder, so far I've discussed holding fewer opinions, opinions about opinions, holding multiple opinions, opinions vs. truths, and opinions weak and strong.)</p>
<p>Ideology is insidious. When I value strict adherence to an ideology above the pursuit of truth, my internally consistent and strongly held opinions become primary to my identity. In a sense, I'm no longer an independent person but merely a receptable for a belief system. Ideology requires mental conformity and a depth of automatism that goes beyond the mere mouthing of slogans; ultimately, it defines who I am.</p>
<p>We're all familiar with how ideology has been used in service of power within authoritarian and totalitarian societies like Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia. However, relatively liberal societies are by no means immune; present-day America is a fine example, squeezed as it is between Trumpism and wokism. (Indeed, America -- having been founded by crazy Englishmen who sailed across the north Atlantic to settle a howling wilderness in search of God or mammon -- seems especially prone to certain forms of fanaticism.)</p>
<p>And yet, despite the overwhelmingly ideological atmosphere in which we live, I think that one always has the option, no matter how difficult it might be to exercise, of resisting the pressures of ideology and instead living in truth, as the Czech dissident Václav Havel put it.</p>
<p>This concept of living in truth is fascinating. Havel learned it from the Czech philosopher Jan Patočka, who was hounded to death by the secret police for being the spokesperson of the human rights group Charter 77. Patočka in turn thought its sources could be traced as far back as the theology of the Church reformer Jan Hus (1372-1415). To my mind, living in truth is bound up with the love and practice of wisdom -- that is, with philosophy in its original and truest sense. While there is overlap here with the scientific, spiritual, and artistic mindsets, I think philosophy as a way of life is one of the greatest antidotes to ideology.</p>
<p>There is much, much more to explore here, which I plan to do in a series of essays over the next few years.</p>

<h2><a href="1681.html">Meditations on Bach #8: Two Quotes from Pablo Casals</a></h2>
<h3>2021-10-26</h3>
<p>Here are two quotes from the great cellist Pablo Casals, who re-introduced the Bach Cello Suites to the world in the early twentieth century...</p>
<blockquote>For the past eighty years I have started each day in the same manner. It is not a mechanical routine but something essential to my daily life. I go to the piano, and I play two preludes and fugues of Bach. I cannot think of doing otherwise. It is a sort of benediction on the house. But that is not its only meaning for me. It is a rediscovery of the world of which I have the joy of being a part. It fills me with awareness of the wonder of life, with a feeling of the incredible marvel of being a human being. The music is never the same for me, never. Each day it is something new, fantastic and unbelievable. That is Bach, like nature, a miracle! (<cite>Joys and Sorrows</cite>, p. 17)</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>My father used to come once a week from Vendrell to visit me. We would go for walks together, sometimes wandering into music shops looking for music scores; and after a few hours he would have to go back home. The repertoire of the ensemble at the Café Pajarera was broader than the Café Tost; I continued my solos, and of course I needed more music. One day I told my father I needed especially to find some new solo music for the Café Pajarera. Together we set off on the search. For two reasons I shall never forget that afternoon. First, my father bought me my first full-sized cello -- how proud I was to have that wonderful instrument! Then we stopped at an old music shop near the harbor. I began browsing through a bundle of musical scores. Suddenly I came upon a sheaf of pages, crumbled and discolored with age. They were unaccompanied suites by Johann Sebastian Bach -- for the cello only! I looked at them with wonder: <cite>Six Suites for Violoncello Solo</cite>. What magic and mystery, I thought, were hidden in those words? I had never heard of the existence of the suites; nobody -- not even my teachers -- had ever mentioned them to me. I forgot our reason for being at the shop. All I could do was stare at the pages and caress them. That scene has never grown dim. Even today, when I look at the cover of that music, I am back again in the old musty shop with its faint smell of the sea. I hurried home, clutching the suites as if they were crown jewels, and once in my room I pored over them. I read and reread them. I was thirteen at the time, but for the following eighty years the wonder of my discovery has continued to grow on me. Those suites opened up a whole new world. I began playing them with indescribable excitement. They became my most cherished music. I studied and worked at them every day for the next twelve years. Yes, twelve years would elapse and I would be twenty-five before I had the courage to play one of the suites at a public concert. Up until then, no violinist or cellist had ever played one of the Bach suites in its entirety. They would play just a single section -- a Sarabande, a Gavotte or a Minuet. But I played them as a whole: from the Prelude through the five dance movements, with all the repeats that give the wonderful entity and pacing and structure of every movement, the full architecture and artistry. They had been considered academic works, mechanical, without warmth. Imagine that! How could anyone think of them as being cold, when a whole radiance of space and poetry pours forth from them? They are the very essence of Bach, and Bach is the essence of music. (<cite>Joys and Sorrows</cite>, pp. 46-47)</blockquote>

<h2><a href="1680.html">There's No Such Thing as a Kudo</a></h2>
<h3>2021-10-17</h3>
<p>It always warms my heart when we import a word directly from ancient Greek into English. Often they are philosophical locutions, such as eudaimonia and ataraxia. Yet at times more mundane terms make the leap; these days perhaps the most common one is kudos (e.g., "kudos to you on aceing that algebra test!"). Consistent with modern English usage, people tend to pronounce it "koo-doze" and think of it as a plural ("that algebra test was really hard so you deserve many kudos for aceing it"). However, in ancient Greek κῦδος was pronounced "koo-doss" and was a singular noun (meaning fame, honor, renown). Just as we give praise (not "a praise") to a friend or colleague, so an ancient Greek might have given κῦδος. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but as a result <em>there is no such thing as a kudo</em>.</p>
