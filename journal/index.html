<h2><a href="1747.html">What is the Job of a News Story?</a></h2>
<h3>2022-11-29</h3>
<p>In the last few months I've blatantly but deliberately gone off my low-information diet - not because I suddenly feel a need to be highly informed, but because I'm advising Otherweb, a startup that aims to fix the world's information ecosystem by presenting only those news stories that are provably lacking in sensationalistic language, partisan fervor, and other manipulative techniques. (Check it out!)</p>
<p>As a result, it's no surprise that I've been pondering the very point of the news. Or, as management thinker Clayton Christiansen would have put it: what's the job of a news story?</p>
<p>First, consider that there's such a thing as the news <em>industry</em>. No matter whether there's <em>really</em> anything important happening, the newspaper must be published, the TV or radio show must be broadcast, etc. This implies that at least some of the news has to be manufactured or at least heavily massaged.</p>
<p>Second, a news outlet doesn't make money by being especially informative, but by selling advertisements (and to a lesser extent garnering subscriptions or in some cases grants and donations). The more that people pay attention to a news outlet, the more valuable its ad space becomes. Thus a news outlet has strong incentives to grab and hold your attention by any means possible. (Although this has gotten worse in the Internet era because each news story can be individually measured for performance, the same underlying incentives have long been there.)</p>
<p>Third, advertisements exist because companies have products to sell. There wasn't much if any advertising 200 years ago because people made most of what they needed at home or could source it in their local community.</p>
<p>By combining these three insights, we can see that the job of a news story is not to inform you, not to be accurate, and not to be true, but to do its part in convincing you to buy stuff.</p>
<p>But wait, it gets worse! A single news story does not have its own life to live, but needs to do its part in continually drawing you back to the news outlet where it originated. It does this by helping to keep you in a state of constant agitation about what might happen next. Cultivating emotions like fear, anger, and greed is not a secondary effect of the news, but one of its primary reasons for being. And if there is no crisis, we'd better create one! (Every national election in recent memory, imminent ecological collapse, the prospect of civil war, etc.)</p>
<p>This leads to a further insight about how the sausage gets made. Having worked in organizations that felt the need to manufacture news stories, I can shed a small ray of light on the matter. Consider a seemingly innocuous story about the latest medical research result - say, a study of sleep patterns. The importance of getting a good night's sleep is a truism, so it's not news. But the researchers need a continual stream of grant money, the medical school's PR people get measured on "impact" in their performance appraisals, big financial donors want to be recognized, etc. Thus when the researcher's paper is published in a medical journal, a news story about the findings gets created, with a catchy headline like "Your Sleep Patterns Could Be Killing You - Here's Why!" Thousands of people, motivated by the ever-present fear of death, click the link and everyone in the news-creation "supply chain" is happy.</p>
<p>Now multiply this scenario by thousands and thousands of news sources: companies with products to sell, authors with books to promote, financiers with profits to pocket, universities with brands to burnish, celebrities with famous names to maintain, influencers with followers to amass, non-profit organizations with an imperative to survive, ideologues with axes to grind, government agencies with budgets to increase, lobbyists and pollsters with clients to please, politicians with power to gain, and all the rest.</p>
<p>But aren't professional journalists of high integrity and superior objectivity supposed to protect the citizenry from these malign influences? I won't even deign to answer that one!</p>
<p>The somewhat cynical conclusion I draw is that much of we read and see and hear is mental junk food that's extruded out of a vast array of self-interested news machines, designed to manipulate our opintions and emotions, and marketed to us as informative yet providing minimal nutritional value.</p>
<p>These days as I read the news, I keep asking one question: "Hey little story, what's your job?" The answers can be illuminating.</p>

<h2><a href="1746.html">Political Moderation</a></h2>
<h3>2022-11-23</h3>
<p>Here in America we've survived another national election (yet again the most momentous in our history!), so following up on my post last week about moderation it seems timely to offer a few reflections on political and ideological moderation.</p>
<p>Having been a dogmatic libertarian earlier in my life, I well understand the allure of political immoderation: the pride of having all the answers, the intellectual gratification of complete consistency and absolute certainty, the beautiful devotion to a moral ideal, the self-transcendence of being part of a movement that aims to change the world, the feeling of superiority over those who lack our special insights, the peculiar pleasure that accompanies righteous anger, and all the rest.</p>
<p>I also understand the deep historical roots of American extremism, given the founder effect of the religious zealots, avaricious adventurers, and other crazy Englishmen who four hundred years ago crossed the stormy North Atlantic in creaky boats to settle a howling wilderness - followed by a continuous stream of risk-takers and borderline fanatics ever since.</p>
<p>So I get it, I really do.</p>
<p>But - and this is perhaps the biggest "but" in human society - <em>utopia is not an option</em>. If I am two or three standard deviations beyond the median voter in my allegiance to progressivism or populism or environmentalism or libertarianism or religious fundamentalism or any other ism, then in a pluralistic society like modern-day America my viewpoint will never be triumphant unless the movement I'm a part of brings significant force to bear against the freedom of thought and action of those we disagree with or whose way of life we dislike. Maybe I believe that such a use of force is morally justified; maybe I believe (with Lenin) that "you can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs"; maybe I believe it's not really force if I outsource it to government bureaucracies or big corporations or social media mobs. But my self-deception shouldn't mean the rest of you need to be in thrall to my extremism.</p>
<p>Average folks (those mythical median voters) aren't extremists. They want good governance, basic competence among public servants, a lack of waste and corruption, respect for the citizenry, decent schools, low crime, public order, stable prices, peaceful transfers of power, and the like. Extremists often have disdain for such "bourgeois" concerns, but they are blind to the fact that "little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism, but peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice" (Adam Smith, <cite>The Wealth of Nations</cite>).</p>
<p>How does one become more moderate, politically or otherwise? The advice Aristotle gave in Book 2 of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> might be relevant:</p>
<blockquote>We must consider the things towards which we ourselves also are easily carried away; for some of us tend to one thing, some to another; and this will be recognizable from the pleasure and the pain we feel. We must drag ourselves away to the contrary extreme; for we shall get into the intermediate state by drawing well away from error, as people do in straightening sticks that are bent.</blockquote>
<p>But this is hard, because if I tend toward an extreme then dragging myself away toward the opposite extreme will feel like compromising with an unalloyed evil. In my experience it's easier to open myself to a wide range of perspectives (e.g., by reading widely in multiple disciplines, preferably from non-partisan sources) and then let those perspectives percolate in my brain for a while. Naturally, this means I need to spend less time reading people I agree with; this is a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>Another activity I find especially helpful is to look seriously at how my preferred ideas and policies have been applied in the real world - and reflect on whether the evidence indicates success or failure in relation to human flourishing. This seems to be what led to changes in my thinking about intellectual property rights some twenty years ago, based on my experience in the open-source software community. A more recent example is marijuana decriminalization, about which I'm on the fence: free-market economic theory predicts that legalization would cause the black market to collapse, but apparently that hasn't happened, to deleterious effect here in Colorado and elsewhere (see a recent analysis entitled "Marijuana's Black Market 2.0" at City Journal). In a similar vein, my environmentalist friends might be interested in how Finland's Green Party committed to nuclear power as a way of reducing CO2 emissions. Examples could be multiplied many times over.</p>
<p>As with personal moderation, political moderation might seem to lack the excitement of Nietzsche's living dangerously. Yet more and more I've come to realize that radicalism is overrated, and to appreciate the value of a principled incrementalism.</p>

<h2><a href="1745.html">Moderation</a></h2>
<h3>2022-11-17</h3>
<p>First, happy World Philosophy Day!</p>
<p>Speaking of philosophy, in my post last week about the wisdom of Socrates, I suggested that he lost his head in his attachment to Alcibiades. And the phrase "lost his head" is appropriate, because in ancient Greek the opposite of doing so was σωφροσύνη, which although usually translated as "moderation" or "temperance" literally means "mind-saving" or "mind-keeping".</p>
<p>Moderation sounds boring. It's so damn reasonable! To those who relish more passion and excitement, it even smacks of selling out. Yet I think moderation is underrated.</p>
<p>First and quite obviously, as Socrates discovered, losing your head can get you in an awful lot of trouble. Countless human beings throughout history have gone astray through unreasonable levels of fear, greed, desire, anger, and other emotions.</p>
<p>Second, you don't need to be immoderate in order to experience the wonders, joys, and pleasures that life has to offer. Too often we are offered only the choice of pure reason vs. pure emotion, but it doesn't take much reflection to realize that this is a false alternative.</p>
<p>Indeed, as Socrates himself argued at length in Plato's dialogue <cite>Philebus</cite>, the union of pleasure with mind and wisdom produces the most beautiful of lives for a human being.</p>
<p>There's no shame in being moderate and reasonable in life. Or, as I sometimes like to put it: Dare to be dull!</p>

<h2><a href="1744.html">How Wise Was Socrates?</a></h2>
<h3>2022-11-10</h3>
<p>Did you know that Socrates' 2500th birthday will occur in 2032? Lately I've been pondering the possibility of writing by then an intellectual biography of Socrates.</p>
<p>One of the hard questions about Socrates is why he was so devoted to Alcibiades, the ultra-rich and incredibly handsome bad boy of 5th-century Athens. Friedrich Hölderlin composed the following poem about the matter:</p>
<blockquote>
„Warum huldigest du, heiliger Sokrates,<br>
Diesem Jünglinge stets? kennest du Größers nicht?<br>
Warum siehet mit Liebe,<br>
Wie auf Götter, dein Aug’ auf ihn?“
<br><br>
Wer das Tiefste gedacht, liebt das Lebendigste,<br>
Hohe Jugend versteht, wer in die Welt geblickt,<br>
Und es neigen die Weisen<br>
Oft am Ende zu Schönem sich.
</blockquote>
<p>Casting this poem into Sapphic meter (which seems fitting given the similar subject-matter of Sappho Fragment 31), I would translate it as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
“Why, O holy Socrates, do you pursue<br>
This youngster? Don’t you know anything greater?<br>
Why do you gaze at him with love in your heart,<br>
As if he’s a god?”
<br><br>
One who has plumbed the depths loves what's most alive;<br>
Knows the bloom of youth who's looked upon the world.<br>
And yet in the end those who are wise often<br>
Bend toward beauty.
</blockquote>
<p>Although the sentiment is attractive, Hölderlin's poem evades the question. Was the sagely Socrates intemperate in his relationship with Alcibiades? If so, was Socrates really as wise as everyone thought?</p>
<p>Recall that when Socrates' friend Chaerephon asked the Delphic Oracle whether anyone was wiser than Socrates, her answer was "No." But because in general the Oracle's wording could be notoriously ambiguous, her statement "no one is wiser" could have meant several things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>At least one person is just as wise as Socrates.</li>
  <li>Everyone is equally wise.</li>
  <li>No one is wise.</li>
</ol>
<p>While it might be true that "those who are wise often bend toward beauty", the same might be true of those who are unwise! Thus Socrates' behavior toward Alcibiades doesn't necessarily put him in good company.</p>
<p>Socrates is the fountainhead of Western philosophy. His life deserves to be examined anew by every thinking person, and I might do just that in a future book entitled, appropriately enough, "No One Wiser"...</p>

<h2><a href="1743.html">The True Self</a></h2>
<h3>2022-11-03</h3>
<p>When we delved into the ancient Greek phrases "Know Thyself" and "Become What You Are" recently, I promised to look more closely at the recent notion of the true self, so here we go.</p>
<p>One basic illustration of the difference between moderns and ancients on this topic is that nowadays we easily throw around the word "self" (perhaps even capitalized "Self") as a standalone entity, whereas in the Greek phrase γνῶθι σαυτόν the word σαυτόν is a reflexive pronoun that does not imply the existence of a Self in all its modern glory. As we might put the matter: it's know thyself, not know thy Self.</p>
<p>Without getting too far into scholarly exegesis, we can see something similar happening in Aristotle's discussion of friendship, where he famously says that "a friend is another self" (Nicomachean Ethics, 1170b6-7). Here the idea is not that someone dear to you is a separate and singular Self of inherent dignity and worth, but that the person is similar to yourself (expressed, again, with a reflexive pronoun).</p>
<p>Speaking of Aristotle, here is how H. Rackham translates a key passage in the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> (1178a2 ff.) in the Loeb classical series:</p>
<blockquote>It may even be held that [the intellect] is the true self of each, inasmuch as it is the dominant and better part; and therefore it would be a strange thing if a man should choose to live not his own life but the life of some other than himself.</blockquote>
<p>The problem is that "the true self" is nowhere to be found in the original Greek, which says only that "it seems that each one is indeed this" (Aristotle's Greek can be quite compressed!).</p> 
<p>So where did we get this idea of a "true self" that is inborn and must be discovered within? Can we find it, for instance, in Shakespeare? After all, in <cite>Hamlet</cite> Polonius gives this piece of advice to his son Laertus: "to thine own self be true". The Bard, in turn, was likely influenced by perhaps the first thinker to unabashedly celebrate the self: Montaigne, who in the preface to his <cite>Essays</cite> of 1580/1588 wrote:</p>
<blockquote>Had my intention been to seek the world’s favour, I should surely have adorned myself with borrowed beauties: I desire therein to be viewed as I appear in mine own genuine, simple, and ordinary manner, without study and artifice: for it is myself I paint. My defects are therein to be read to the life, and any imperfections and my natural form, so far as public reverence hath permitted me. If I had lived among those nations, which (they say) yet dwell under the sweet liberty of nature’s primitive laws, I assure thee I would most willingly have painted myself quite fully and quite naked. Thus, reader, myself am the matter of my book: there’s no reason thou shouldst employ thy leisure about so frivolous and vain a subject.</blockquote>
<p>Yet although Montaigne claimed that he was being true to himself, neither he nor Shakespeare made any claims about the existence of a "true self".</p>
<p>As far as I know, our modern conception of the true self might be found first in the writings of the Danish Christian thinker Søren Kierkegaard (1813-1855). Consider this passage from his book <cite>Purity of Heart Is to Will One Thing</cite>, quoted with approval by David L. Norton on page 67 of <cite>Personal Destinies</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>I do not now whether it is true that at each man's birth two angels are born, his good angel and his bad angel. But this I do believe (and I will gladly listen to any objection, although I will not believe it) that at each man's birth there comes into being an eternal vocation for him, expressly for him. To be true to himself in relation to this eternal vocation is the highest thing a man can practice, and, as that most profound poet has said: "Self-love is not so vile a sin as self-forgetting." [Shakespeare, Henry V, Act 2, Scene 4] Then there is but one fault, one offense: disloyalty to his own self or the denial of his own better self.</blockquote>
<p>There are clear connections between Kierkegaard's idea of an "eternal vocation" and the older Christian idea of a personal calling, i.e., of being called by God to perform a certain kind of work in the world. However, although a calling might deeply color one's long-term goals and characteristic activities, it seems that we can still distinguish the person from the calling. That feels less straightforward when we speak of a person's true self. Indeed, my friend Kurt Keefner shared an excellent formulation with me recently: "the self is a person viewed from its own point of view"; thus that eternal vocation is, as Nietzsche put it in the imperative form in <cite>The Joyful Wisdom</cite>: "You shall become the person you are."</p>
<p>There is much, much more to say on this theme, but this mini-essay is already longer than I'd like, so I'll save further reflections for another day.</p>

<h2><a href="1742.html">Become What You Are</a></h2>
<h3>2022-10-27</h3>
<p>Following on our investigation last week of the ancient Greek maxim "Know Thyself", I thought it might be interesting to explain another Greek phrase that has gained currency in recent times: "Become What You Are".</p>
<p>In his book <cite>Personal Destinies</cite> (which I've started to re-read after a gap of perhaps 30 years and which I'll report on much more fully in future posts), philosopher David L. Norton puts "Become What You Are" on an equal footing with "Know Thyself" in ancient Greek culture. Yet this is far from the truth. "Know Thyself" was on everyone's lips (as Plato puts it) and it echoed throughout Greek culture, whereas "Become What You Are" was a single line in a poem by Pindar.</p>
<p>In Greek it reads γένοι' οἷος ἐσσὶ μαθών which we can well translate as "become such as you are, having learned what that is." The "such as you are" is key: this is not about your unique individuality but about the kind of human, mortal being you are. Pindar makes this clear in the remainder of his second Pythian Ode, where he emphasizes that "a man must always measure all things according to his own place" and that "one must not fight against a god". Indeed, Pindar's intent here is quite consistent with "Know Thyself" in the sense of knowing your place, as explained in my previous post.</p>
<p>So where did this idea come from that "Become What You Are" means something like Shakespeare's "to thine own self be true"? I finger Nietzsche, who made much of Pindar's line in his book <cite>The Joyful Wisdom</cite>. Now, I happen to like what Nietzsche did with Pindar and I even composed a poem entitled "Become What You Are" for my collection <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite>, but that doesn't imply that Pindar or the ancient Greeks in general thought about the self as we do.</p>
<p>Having cleared away some of the underbrush, next time I'll look into our modern notion of the true self.</p>
