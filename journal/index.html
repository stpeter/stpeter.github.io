<h2><a href="1795.html">Mind the Gap</a></h2>
<h3>2023-07-08</h3>
<p>In my recent post about discovering the best we can do, I mentioned the inevitability of a gap between the ideal and the real, especially for those who have high standards of personal behavior. This leads to the question: how do you figure out where you fall short?</p>
<p>In my experience this isn't always easy, for several reasons. First, we all like to think well of ourselves (self-deception is the easiest thing in the world), so we might not be eager to identify those gaps. Second, we live in a culture that celebrates people's strengths, but avoids talking about failings, faults, or flaws, let alone vices and sins - such antiquated moralizing! Third, not only is it difficult to be honest with ourselves, but it's also difficult to convince family, friends, colleagues, and other people to be honest with us.</p>
<p>One way around these obstacles, at least in the business world, is the 360Ëš assessment, wherein people you work with are asked to anonymously rate you on key behaviors (e.g., delegation and communication). Another technique is to actively seek out feedback from people you interact with, for instance after you give a presentation or facilitate a brainstorming session.</p>
<p>When it comes to more subtle aspects of behavior, there's no substitute for emotional awareness in relation to yourself and others. As far as I can see, this comes in three primary flavors: monitoring yourself for unhealthy emotions such as anger, closely watching how other people react to what you say and do, and comparing yourself to people you interact with in person or read about in literature or biographies so that you can acquire their admirable traits or avoid their negative ones.</p>
<p>Naturally, this assumes that you have a modicum of emotional awareness in the first place. Over the course of my career, I worked with several people who seemed to be utterly lacking in emotional awareness; indeed, earlier in life I bore an uncanny resemblance to such people. I can't exactly explain how I pulled myself out of that hole, other than to say that at some point in my twenties I became dissatisfied with myself and formed the vague ambition to be a better person. Even then, it took me a long time to improve. Yes, that gap is still there, but at least it's not nearly as wide as it once was.</p>

<h2><a href="1794.html">The Best We Can Do</a></h2>
<h3>2023-07-04</h3>
<p>Here's a further thought about the examined life, which the other day I summarized as "The best way to live is to never stop asking yourself: What is the best way to live?" Implicit in that formulation is a focus on personal improvement, for it involves continually asking yourself "Is this the best I can do?" For someone with high ethical ideals, the answer is always "not quite" because there is always a gap between the ideal and the real. Having those ideals gives us something to strive for. As I like say, "You don't have to achieve an ideal to realize the benefits of idealism."</p>
<p>The same applies, I might add, at the societal level. Today is America's 247th birthday. These days many people focus on what's wrong with America and her history. But that's nothing new. From the very start, many Americans knew that there was a large gap, perhaps even a yawning chasm, between the American ideals expressed in the Declaration of Independence and the American reality of slavery. Even before the Constitution was ratified in 1787, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Rhode Island had passed emancipation laws. At his death in 1799, George Washington, alone among the founders, liberated the slaves he had inherited. As a society, every once in a while we've had to ask ourselves if this is the best we can do, and we've found ourselves wanting - resulting in the Civil War, Reconstruction and subsequent backsliding, the abolition of the Jim Crow laws, the civil rights movement, and most recently yet another racial reckoning (not to mention women's suffrage and numerous other corrections).</p>
<p>You might think that we should have solved all of our problems by now, but history doesn't work that way. As Alexis de Tocqueville once said, "The greatness of America lies not in being more enlightened than any other nation, but rather in her ability to repair her faults." I remain optimistic that we Americans can live up to our ideals. In any case, because utopia is not an option, continuing to repair our faults is literally the best we can do.</p>
<p>This loops right back around to the personal: what is the best that I can do as an individual? Many people find it easier to rail against societal problems than to engage in the most difficult reform of all: the inner revolution of self-improvement. In today's climate of ideological extremism, that necessitates political moderation, truly educating yourself about American history and present-day society, and identifying opportunities to make a difference in your community. Therein lies the only long-term path to closing the gap between the ideal and the real.</p>

<h2><a href="1793.html">Certainty</a></h2>
<h3>2023-07-02</h3>
<p>In my post the other day about the examined life, I observed that some people are certain about their answers to the great questions of life. By contrast, those of a Socratic bent typically doubt that certainty is likely or even possible. The standard rejoinder is this: "It sounds like you're certain that certainty is impossible." Quite the conundrum.</p>
<p>For myself, over time I've become less certain about most things theoretical. Life is complex, and it's difficult to unambiguously define and unpack concepts like courage or justice. Indeed, Aristotle argued that it's foolish to strive for more precision in a domain like ethics than can be reasonably expected. The reason is that we can't merely rely on theory: we need practical wisdom to help us sort out the messy realities we face every day.</p>
<p>At the same time that I've become less certain about most theories, I've become more certain about some facts - even or especially facts with ethical implications, such as that human beings are social animals for whom family, friendship, and community are central features of a human way of life. Similarly for phenomena such as language, discourse, emotion, memory, forethought, and imagination, which undergird excellent practices like empathy, reflection, and deliberation.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the pursuit of certainty has caused endless havoc for societies, organizations, and individuals, in the form of religious dogmas, political absolutism, and overly rigid rules of behavior. Yet perhaps we've been looking for certainty in all the wrong places: perhaps certainty is not to be found in the theoretical clouds, but right here on earth in the deeply human interactions that ground our lives. So here's a heretical thought: the truly philosophical life might require a lot less theory focused on faraway abstractions and a lot more practice focused on what is near and dear.</p>

<h2><a href="1792.html">The Examined Life</a></h2>
<h3>2023-06-29</h3>
<p>All the great questions of life boil down to this: What is the best way to live?</p>
<p>The great questions of life include the ones that Socrates posed 2400 year ago: what is courage? what is moderation? what is justice? what is love? what is beauty? what is truth? what is wisdom?</p>
<p>The great questions also include more modern concerns, such as how best to make a living, to find one's calling, or to interact with technology (topics that much exercised Thoreau, for instance).</p>
<p>I suppose that some people don't think about the great questions - instead they skate or slouch or sleepwalk through life, unaware of the deeper themes of human existence.</p>
<p>Others are certain that the great questions have straightforward answers, inherited from a particular creed or religion or cultural tradition.</p>
<p>Socrates often undercut such people's certainty by haranguing them in the Athenian agora. Eventually they got tired of him and put him to death. Yet Socrates had the last laugh: no one remembers his accusers, but they do remember his admonition that the unexamined life is not worth living for a human being. In more positive terms we could phrase it like this: "The best way to live is to never stop asking yourself: What is the best way to live?"</p>

<h2><a href="1791.html">Threading a Middle Path</a></h2>
<h3>2023-06-22</h3>
<p>In the past I've written about both the ancient philosophical method of dialectic and the importance of intellectual and political moderation. Here I'd like to bring these two strands together.</p>
<p>To summarize briefly, in Aristotle's hands dialectic consists of four key steps: upon (i) reaching an impasse, you (ii) survey existing explanations and reputable opinions, (iii) engage in analysis to remove paradoxes and draw distinctions, then (iv) formulate a synthesis that harmonizes the explanations and saves the appearances.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, Aristotle's discussion of societal organization in his <cite>Politics</cite>. In the ancient Greece of 2400 years ago, there were three primary political philosophies: monarchy (rule by one person, whether king or tyrant), oligarchy (rule by the few, whether true aristocracy or faction), and democracy (rule by the people, whether community or rabble). Whereas most political philosophies attract what Eric Hoffer identified as true believers, Aristotle carefully weighs the positives and negatives of each approach to governance, concluding that the best form of government does justice to each of these three principles. Of note, the U.S. Founders manifested the strong influence of Aristotle when they defined roles for a single President, an somewhat aristocratic Senate, and a more populous House.</p>
<p>Similarly, in his <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> and <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite>, Aristotle considers three primary ways of life: the life of enjoyment, the life of public virtue, and the life of inquiry. In the end he concludes that the best life for human beings combines elements of all three; in particular, inquiry is deeply enjoyable and presupposes excellence of character. (I'll say much more about this in <cite>Complete Thyself</cite>, my forthcoming book on Aristotle's conception of human fulfillment.)</p>
<p>Because dialectic typically threads a middle path between extremes, one essential result is an abundance of moderation and a lack of partisanship. Thus dialectic can be a tool for the kind of healthy eclecticism I wrote about the other day, although it might go even farther by leading to a true synthesis of seeming opposites (sometimes referred to as syncretism).</p>
<p>I'm not saying this is easy. Many forces in present-day society (especially in America) lead us toward a downward spiral of angry, emotivistic extremism, not an upward spiral of interpersonal respect and reasonable moderation. Personally, I've found that the best way to avoid these extremes is to root myself in the eternal realities of deep human connection: family, friends, work, love, art, wisdom, community, and the like. In the end, what more do we really have?</p>

<h2><a href="1790.html">Chosen Wisdom</a></h2>
<h3>2023-06-20</h3>
<p>The longer I study and practice philosophy, the more value I find in a wide variety of wisdom traditions. When I first became interested in philosophy at the age of 12, it was exclusively in the form of Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism. About this philosophy I was, at least throughout my teenage years, thoroughly dogmatic: all the other philosophies were riddled with error - not even worth considering - and Rand's philosophy simply <em>was</em> philosophy as far as I was concerned. (To be clear, the fault was not Rand's but my own - I could have been just as dogmatic about Stoicism or existentialism.)</p>
<p>Ironically, it was by taking a course on the history of philosophy with a confirmed Objectivist that I experienced the first inklings of doubt. Delving into Aristotle in college opened my eyes further, but I would be lying if I said that I quickly realized the error of my ways. In fact, it took me years - decades - to see that philosophy is more of a verb than a noun, more of an activity than an established body of doctrine. To my mind, this implies that the point of philosophy is not to identify with or adhere to a particular school of thought, but to approach the deepest philosophical questions in a spirit of wonder and to independently discover the wisest answers wherever you may find them.</p>
<p>Dogmatists might derisively call this eclecticism. Yet, to strike at the root (as Thoreau once put it), in ancient Greek <em>eklektikos</em> meant being selective, exercising discernment, using your critical faculties, coming to first-hand judgments about the truth of things. To come full circle, this is entirely consistent with the very best of Rand's conception of reason, which she said is founded in "the independent mind that recognizes no authority higher than its own and no value higher than its judgment of truth."</p>
<p>It stands to reason that no one school of philosophy can do justice to the manifest complexities of human life, for we need multiple different perspectives to make sense of it all. At the same time, the different schools often see the same truths but assign them different emphases or express them in different terms, and part of the fun of philosophy as a way of life is seeing those deep connections across schools and thinkers.</p>
<p>To go even further, whatever chosen wisdom I achieve cannot be exactly the same as yours, because my activity of sense-making is not exactly the same as yours (that's the way minds work). This doesn't mean that all truth is utterly relative - for there are human universals like language, sociality, and autonomy - but it does mean that dialogue is fundamental to the love and practice of wisdom. Which is precisely what Socrates recognized 2500 years ago when he said that the unexamined life is not worth living, because we examine life both on our own and together in the everyday activities of work, love, family, friendship, and community. Anything less is less than fully human.</p>
