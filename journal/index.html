<h2><a href="1783.html">Ways of Life and Lines of Work</a></h2>
<h3>2023-06-01</h3>
<p>Because labor is so central to human existence, throughout history various thinkers have speculated about what the Buddhist eightfold path calls "right livelihood" for those who would seek and practice wisdom. For instance, both the Stoic Musonius Rufus and the Confucian Wu Yubi advocated subsistence farming as a noble line of work. The Taoist sage Chuang Tzu tells a beautiful story about the artistry of a lowly butcher. Although officially Aristotle downplayed the value of mechanical pursuits like housebuilding and even music-making, nevertheless he frequently used craftsmen as models of practical thinking and he applied the lessons of craftsmanship to ethical reflection. In recent times, Matthew Crawford titled one of his books "shop class as soul craft" and has argued that working in the trades enables you to bring your whole self to your productive activities. And so on.</p>
<p>It's been said that there is something especially fulfilling or even honest about working with your hands. At one level that makes sense, because so much about a human way of life depends on our hands (we are tool-makers who manage and manipulate things, and we even speak of grasping ideas). Yet other aspects of human existence are nearly as fundamental, such as our social interactions and our conceptual-linguistic abilities; although some folks prefer working with things, others prefer working with people or with symbols.</p>
<p>Moreover, recent research in the social sciences (e.g., by Amy Wrzesniewski and colleagues) indicates that three attitudes toward work are nearly ubiquitous: seeing work as a job, as a career, or as a calling. And within the latter, Michael Pratt et al. have identified three distinct orientations (which are not mutually exclusive):</p>
<ol>
<li>A craftsmanship orientation that is focused on doing the work well for its own sake. Workers with a craftsmanship orientation typically care most about gaining expertise, often emphasize the aesthetic aspects of the work product, and might have a goal of becoming a master practitioner.</li>
<li>A serving orientation that is focused on doing good for the sake of other people. Workers with a serving orientation typically care most about the beneficiaries of their work and derive satisfaction from helping people.</li>
<li>A team orientation that is focused on doing the work with one's teammates. Workers with a kinship orientation typically find value in opportunities for building close, family-like bonds with their colleagues.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus it strikes me that just about every line of work can afford opportunities for learning, reflection, self-improvement, and fulfillment. It's more a question of how you approach the work than what the work is in itself.</p>

<h2><a href="1782.html">Ways of Life</a></h2>
<h3>2023-05-17</h3>
<p>Having last week explored what philosophers do, I thought I'd broaden that theme by looking at ways of life in general, not only philosophy as a way of life.</p>
<p>Although Aristotle delineated four ways of life (making money, having fun, public service, and intellectual inquiry), nowadays we often think of various hobbies and pursuits as something approaching a way of life. Often these are bound up with one's profession or career (the unfortunately ubiquitous question "what do you do?"), but just as often they are associated with some other focal activity that is a relatively core part of your identity: runner, foodie, crafter, or what have you.</p>
<p>This kind of lifeway can have a significant effect on how you spend your time and structure your day, what you think about and pay attention to, your habits of mind and emotion, how you react to events, the relationships you cultivate, and so on. For instance, a runner traveling to another city might pack her running gear, plan runs while staying there, perhaps meet up with a local running partner or group, etc. By contrast, a foodie traveling to the same location might check out intriguing restaurants, fresh food markets, cooking classes, and the like.</p>
<p>Because there are only so many hours in the day, there are limits to how many ways of life you can pursue in a serious manner at any one stage of life - I'd say less than five and perhaps only two or three. During my 25-year career in the tech industry, I found that I had time and attention primarily for my work and secondarily for some philosophical research and writing, but not also for musical projects.</p>
<p>Yet even that might have been stretching it. Consider a person who is not only passionate about a particular pursuit, but who borders on obsessive (although perhaps in a good way). To take a well-known example, consider J.S. Bach: he was constantly immersed in music, whether playing, teaching, composing, organizing concerts, consulting with musical instrument makers, and so on. Even his close friends, his extended family members, and his two wives (first Maria Barbara and then Anna Magdelena) were musicians! Music was such a thoroughgoing way of life for him that it truly <em>was</em> his life.</p>
<p>Is that level of lifelong commitment necessary to find fulfillment? For some people it is (indeed, in the <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite> Aristotle claimed that it is the height of folly not to have a single, overarching purpose in life). Yet others are just as happy structuring their lives into a few distinct stages (Ã  la the Hindu ashramas) or going with the flow of life in an even looser fashion and following new interests as they arise. It seems to me that deciding which of these approaches makes sense for you is a large part of what it means to know thyself, as the ancient Greeks counseled.</p>

<h2><a href="1781.html">Open Reading Interview</a></h2>
<h3>2023-05-11</h3>
<p>Three weeks ago I had the honor of being interviewed by Sal Inglima of Boston Free Radio for his Open Readings show. We had a great time talking about the fine art of poetry translation. Sal read aloud my translation of a German poem about the eve of World War II by philosopher Walter Kaufmann and I read my translation of Sappho fragment 16 as well as two of my own poems: Ancient Fire (from the eponymous collection) and Brief Wisdom (from <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite>, my book about Friedrich Nietzsche). Enjoy!</p>

<h2><a href="1780.html">What Philosophers Do</a></h2>
<h3>2023-05-11</h3>
<p>If philosophy is a way of life, then what are the characteristic activities of philosophers? (I mean, of course, not professors of philosophy, but people who love and practice the minerval arts of wisdom.)</p>
<p>As far as I know, there is surprisingly little written on this topic, even by Pierre Hadot, who resurrected the ancient conception of philosophy as a way of life about 40 years ago. Sure, Socrates harangued his fellow Athenians in the agora, Confucius traveled around the fragmented states of ancient China encouraging various kings and princes to rule benevolently, the Buddha found enlightenment while mediating under the bodhi tree, Thoreau built a little house by the shores of Walden Pond and rambled around the Concord countryside, Spinoza got excommunicated for heretical thinking and ground lenses for a living, and so on.</p>
<p>Even right there we have quite the diversity in ways of life. As to more theoretical or academic activities, many philosophers wrote down their thoughts for future generations, but others, such as Socrates and Epictetus, wrote not a word. Some, like Plato, started a school where they gathered students and disciples; some, like Epicurus, formed intentional communities; but others, like Nietzsche and Spinoza, lived in relative solitude. Some, like Chu Hsi, were bookish scholars; others were more interested in directly fronting the essential facts of life, as Thoreau put it.</p>
<p>Yet underneath it all, I see this: a philosopher engages in deep and serious reflection about being human, and uses those reflections as the firm foundation for living deliberately and doing consistently what is beautifully right. Indeed, a philosopher takes life and wisdom so seriously that he or she holds as an ideal a lifetime of striving to become a great human being and a noble sage.</p>
<p>These formulations contain many concepts that are quite rarified, admittedly aspirational, and even untimely: reflection, deliberation, depth, seriousness, wisdom, beauty, rightness, greatness, humanity, nobility, sagehood. That strikes me as unavoidable, for, as Spinoza observed, all things excellent are as difficult as they are rare.</p>
<p>If this be idealism, make the most of it.</p>

<h2><a href="1779.html">Much Ado about Nothingness</a></h2>
<h3>2023-05-04</h3>
<p>In pursuit of wisdom, I often explore intellectual traditions I'm not familiar with. Most recently, I've been reading a sourcebook of Japanese philosophy, in which I found a fascinating essay by Abe Masao (1915-2006) on the Buddhist concept of emptiness or nothingness.</p>
<p>Abe's foil here is Plato. In Plato's dialogue <cite>Parmenides</cite>, Socrates argues that there must be an ultimate reality behind the unstable flux of human experience - specifically, unchanging archetypes called Forms that are located in some other dimension of existence. With due respect to Plato, Abe maintains that there is no such ultimate reality: the only world we have is the world of experience, behind which there is absolute emptiness or nothingness.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, Buddhism holds that there is no ultimate reality - no unchanging, individual True Self - behind our inner experience, either. Instead, the "original nature" or "buddha nature" is a potential that all human beings can live up to with enough practice (or, given the Buddhist doctrine of reincarnation, enough lifetimes).</p>
<p>Through his opposition to the concept of an ultimate reality, Abe seems to propose a kind of positive emptiness: not a nothingness of despair as in existentialism or fatalism, but a clearing away of the conceptual and emotional underbrush so that we can minimize our attachment to false notions and expectations. Only by doing so can we open ourselves up to fulfilling our highest human potential. Indeed, because Aristotle held that the self is an achievement, Aristotle and the Buddha might not have been very far apart on this issue, which might be a bit of a surprise!</p>

<h2><a href="1778.html">The Determinist Fantasy</a></h2>
<h3>2023-04-27</h3>
<p>Determinism - the belief that all events (including animal behavior and human actions) are fixed or ordained by antecedent conditions or external forces before they happen - doesn't keep me up at night, but it seems to be something of a bogeyman for many people. To my mind, it's a fantastical notion. Here's how I perceive the argument for this belief:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Every event in the universe, no matter how complex, could be explained by a perfectly complete set of natural laws.</li>
  <li>All natural laws could be predictive with complete precision and complete accuracy.</li>
  <li>It is possible that an all-knowing entity (god, demon, computer, whatever) could possess (a) complete knowledge of all natural laws and (b) complete information about the condition of the universe at a particular time.</li>
  <li>This entity would be able to predict all subsequent events in the universe.</li>
  <li>The predictive success of this entity would demonstrate that all events are strictly determined by previous conditions.</li>
  <li>Therefore determinism is true.</li>
</ol>
<p>One could provide many sophisticated philosophical arguments against the determinist fantasy, involving GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorem, the epistemology of explanation and prediction, the nature of time, etc. Because I like to keep things short and sweet, instead I'll use a homely example: the honeybee.</p>
<p>What would our all-knowing entity need to know in order to precisely and accurately predict every event in the life a single honeybee? And I do mean every: its exact lifespan, its exact physiological activity at every moment, exactly how many times each day it flies out of the hive for pollen, its exact flight paths, exactly which flowers it visits and for how long, exactly what messages it exchanges with its hivemates, exactly what obstacles and conditions it experiences and exactly how it reacts, and so on. Even if the bee never flies more than a mile from the hive and the hive contains only one hundred bees and there are only a thousand flowers within a one-mile radius (of course these things change with the seasons and the weather and the passage of time), the possible event-trees for prediction purposes must number in the trillions or more.</p>
<p>And that's just one little honeybee! Consider that, even in that one square mile of earth, we'd need to multiply by a hundred of bees in the hive, a thousand flowers, thousands of other insects, hundreds of birds and quadrupeds and bushes and trees, hundreds of thousands of blades of grass, and so on - not to mention the exact composition and condition of the soil and the constantly moving and changing air (including every weather event), etc. Oh, and let's multiply all that by hundreds of millions of square miles of the earth's surface area, or cubic miles of land mass and ocean. And then multiply again by hundreds of billions of galaxies and their constituent solar systems. How would our all-knowing entity learn about the exact condition of all these things, and do so at the same time? (We must of course factor in the speed of light, not to mention undefined methods of measurement.) How indeed would all these events throughout the universe not merely be roughly modeled but precisely and accurately predicted? Leaving aside gods and demons, how enormous would a computer need to be in order to formulate such predictions - and what impact would such an enormous computer have on the universe itself? (This impact, too, would need to be predicted because, after all, the computer itself would be part of the universe.)</p>
<p>This brief thought experiment leads me to conclude that determinism is not a serious hypothesis, but a groundless fantasy. And I have much more important things to spend my time on than groundless fantasies!</p>
