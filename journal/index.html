<h2><a href="1887.html">Nicholas Dykes, RIP</a></h2>
<h3>2024-08-01</h3>
<p>Today I was saddened to learn, belatedly, that my friend Nicholas Dykes passed away earlier this year. Nick and I corresponded on and off for 25 years, ever since I published his poems "First Call of a Redwing" and "On Mynydd Troed" in The Monadnock Review, a webzine I maintained from 1997 to 2002. I was lucky to spend a few hours with him in person back in 2006 after the memorial service for British libertarian writer and activist Chris Tame, since I just happened to be London at that time and took the train down to Chichester for the event. Although Nick had strong opinions and took exception to my book <cite>The Tao of Roark</cite> (if I recall correctly, he thought it was repetitious and unenlightening), we always enjoyed sharing thoughts about philosophy and literature. I really liked his novel <cite>Old Nick's Guide to Happiness</cite> (a kind of philosophical adventure story) and was looking forward to the novel he was working on at the time of his death, about a lost island of Epicureans in the Indian Ocean. He will be missed. Rest in peace, my friend.</p>

<h2><a href="1886.html">Reincarnation</a></h2>
<h3>2024-07-31</h3>
<p>No, not <em>that</em> kind of reincarnation. I refer instead to the mind tricks involved in fiction-writing. As I've been exploring the possibility of composing an epic poem about Pyrrho and Alexander (to date I've produced less than 200 lines, so don't get too excited!), I've treated it as if it were a translation of a lost work by Timon of Phlius, the best-known disciple of Pyrrho and a thinker who often wrote in a Homeric style. However, by no means am I expert in such matters, which is why I defer to the great Russian writer Yevgeny Zamyatin in his essay "On Language" (translated by Mirra Ginsburg):</p>
<blockquote>The writer must reincarnate himself wholly into the characters, the milieu he is portraying. If you are writing about provincial life, you must yourself at that moment live the life of the province, among provincials; you must think like a provincial; you must forget that there are such places as Petersburg, Moscow, Europe, and that you are writing, perhaps, mostly for Moscow and Petersburg, rather than Chukhloma or Alatyr. If you are writing about Carthage, Hamilcar, Salammbo, you must forget that you live in the nineteenth century A.D., you must feel and speak like Hamilcar. If you are writing about a modern Englishman, you must think in English and write in such a way that what you have written in Russian will read like a good translation from English.</blockquote>
<p>As an example, Zamyatin mentions that someone once asked him if his story <cite>The Islanders</cite> had been translated from English. Yet he does not wish to take this too far:</p>
<blockquote>When I spoke about "the language of the milieu," I did not mean the literal language of the milieu, but an artistic synthesis of the language of the milieu, a stylization of it. In writing about peasants, it is by no means necessary to use the crudest forms of peasant speech. This would be in bad taste and would attest to the writer's ineptness. An experienced writer always knows how to create an artistically synthesized impression of the actual language of the milieu without crude extremes or distortion.</blockquote>
<p>Why is this important? The key is that, for the reader (and for the writer, too), being exposed to the language of the milieu enables you to immerse yourself more deeply in the assumptions, the thinking, indeed the very world of the characters and events being portrayed:</p>
<blockquote>Every milieu, era, nation has its own language structure, its own syntax, its own way of thinking. And this is what we must absorb and utilize. The characteristic deviations in language are not grammatical, but syntactic. The most characteristic elements, and at the same time the elements which least distort literary language, are the word order and the choice of synonyms. It is these - the syntax, the word order, the synonyms - that we must study, learn to feel, and endeavor to reproduce in a story or novel. None of these factors introduce any crude distortions into the language, and yet they convey perfectly the spirit of the language of the given milieu.</blockquote>
<p>Although Zamyatin is most famous for his amazing dystopia <cite>WE</cite>, I've always found great value in his essays, too...</p>

<h2><a href="1885.html">Shakespeare on Self-Knowledge and Self-Mastery</a></h2>
<h3>2024-07-30</h3>
<p>Having read all of Shakespeare over the last eight months, I find myself even more inspired to explore the philosophical insights embedded throughout the plays. As previously mentioned, in <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite> Shakespeare calls philosophy "the sweet milk of adversity", since it provides us with consolation in hard times. Yet it also fortifies and prepares us for successful action and much else besides.</p>
<p>I noticed in my readings that Shakespeare focuses especially on self-knowledge and self-mastery (e.g., the use of reason to cultivate patience and avoid intemperance). Indeed, these two topics are closely related. Consider the character of Marc Antony in <cite>Antony and Cleopatra</cite>: in Act III, Canidius says that "had our general been what he knew himself, it had gone well" (III.10), but soon after we learn that Antony's fundamental mistake was to "make his will lord of his reason" (3.13). Similarly, in <cite>Cymbeline</cite> Imogen observes that a person who has "great knowing" should thereby learn forbearance (2.3). In <cite>Hamlet</cite>, Horatio warns Hamlet that interacting with the ghost of his father "might deprive your sovereignty of reason and draw you into madness" (1.4). In Macbeth, Ross laments that "cruel are the times, when we are traitors and do not know ourselves" (4.2). Perhaps the classic example is King Lear: at the very beginning of the play, Regan complains that her father "hath ever but slenderly known himself" (1.1), which is likely why he made such a bad decision about dividing up his realm.</p>
<p>These are far from the only plays in which self-knowledge and self-mastery loom large: others I noticed in this first reading include <cite>Coriolanus</cite>, <cite>Henry IV Part 1</cite>, <cite>Henry VIII</cite>, <cite>King John</cite>, <cite>Measure for Measure</cite>, <cite>The Merchant of Venice</cite>, <cite>Much Ado About Nothing</cite>, <cite>Othello</cite>, <cite>Pericles</cite>, <cite>Titus Andronicus</cite>, and <cite>Twelfth Night</cite>.</p>
<p>Moreover, self-knowledge and self-mastery are not the only philosophical topics in Shakespeare: consider the importance of appearance vs. reality, virtue vs. vice, prosperity vs. adversity, courage vs. cowardice, wisdom vs. foolishness, truth vs. deception, passion vs. moderation, justice, grief, honor, pride, power, ambition, and more. Shakespeare is a veritable gold mine of philosophical insights artfully illustrated through vivid characters, momentous decisions, and exalted actions. Such grandeur! I'll be posting periodically about Shakespeare and philosophy in the coming months as I explore these topics in greater depth.</p>

<h2><a href="1884.html">Walking with Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics VI.1-2</a></h2>
<h3>2024-07-29</h3>
<p>Here we are, halfway through the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>. Because the path becomes rather steep and stony at this point, we're going to slow down and step carefully so that we don't tumble down the side of the mountain. Hey, no one ever promised that walking with Aristotle was going to be a leisurely stroll in the park!</p>
<p>In Book VI, Aristotle turns to the so-called "intellectual virtues" - personal excellences that enable you to understand the world around you, think things through, and make better decisions. To give you a flavor of what he's talking about, at the very beginning of Chapter 3 he lists five such thrivings: craft [technē], understanding [epistēmē], wisdom [phronēsis], sagacity [sophia], and insight [nous]. These are all acquired traits by which the soul "truths" [alētheuei], in ways that we will explore in depth as we keep climbing.</p>
<p>If you're wondering why we need to concern ourselves with intellectual virtues at all, recall that, on Aristotle's view, the actions and feelings which are admirably appropriate and beautifully right must be deliberately chosen in accord with the "correct account" [orthos logos]. This indicates that at least a few excellences of thought might be involved, such as an understanding [epistēmē] of human nature and the human good, insight [nous] into particular situations, and the wisdom [phronēsis] to make good choices and commitments.</p>
<p>However, of these, only insight [nous] is said to "govern" action and truth; the other two governing factors are perception [aisthēsis] and reaching/yearning [orexis]. Although Aristotle earlier said that action-guiding judgment is a matter of perceiving the particulars of a situation, perception isn't enough for us because whereas animals have perception they don't engage in "taking action" [praxis] in the way that humans do. The source of taking action is choice or commitment [prohairesis]; in turn, the source of choice or commitment is a goal-oriented combination of reaching/yearning and the sort of account [logos] that grounds deliberation and reflection. Because an account is involved, so are insight [nous] and thinking [dianoia]. In order for your actions to be of serious worth [spoudaia], the account needs to be true [alēthēs] and the reaching/yearning needs to be correct [orthos]. Thus doing well [eupraxia], which is nearly synonymous with fulfillment [eudaimonia], requires both character <em>and</em> thinking. The underlying cause seems to be that craft [technē], which Aristotle says doesn't involve character, always has its completion [telos] outside itself (e.g., in an artifact), whereas the specifically human kind of activity has its completion within itself and exists for its own sake.</p>
<p>How can we thread our way through this boulder-field of concepts? Hopefully things will become clearer as we make our way up the mountain, but for now I see a few takeaways, which I'll need to ponder further before I grok them in fullness:</p>
<ol>
  <li>All of these mental traits are bound up with "truthing" [alētheuein] - apparently even the traits dedicated to making things (craft) and to taking action (wisdom), where we moderns don't usually think that truth-claims are part of the story.</li>
  <li>Activity that is rooted in character traits has its own inherent completeness, likely because it is expressive of human nature (e.g., reason and sociality) in an especially deep way.</li>
  <li>People who take life seriously don't do things through mindless habit: not only do they develop character traits but they also apply those traits thoughtfully, work to gain insight into human behavior, and seek to really understand the human condition and the human good.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'll be curious to explore these ideas more comprehensively as we move along in our walk with Aristotle.</p>

<h2><a href="1883.html">Walking with Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics V.1-11</a></h2>
<h3>2024-07-18</h3>
<p>There's something unsatisfying, almost clinical, about Book V of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> (which also happens to be Book IV of the <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite> - more on that some other time). Whereas in Books II through IV his exploration of various character traits repeatedly emphasized the importance of action and feeling for the sake of what's beautifully right, that quasi-aesthetic perspective gives way here to dry discussions of proportionality, reciprocity, compensation, and the like. To me this indicates the severe limitations of justice as a virtue, not its centrality to ethics and the good life.</p>
<p>In V.1, Aristotle begins by observing that, in one sense, justice is complete virtue: for justice is doing what the law enjoins, and the law disallows the most extreme vices (cowardice in the form of military desertion, immoderation in the form of adultery, anger in the form of assault, etc.). Yet in practice this isn't all that helpful, because few of us go so far astray that we do what's repulsively wrong; it's in the great middle ground where we need more specific guidance to identify and enact what's beautifully right - yet here the law is silent.</p>
<p>Eventually, in V.10, Aristotle points in a more beautiful direction: yes, justice is good, but even better is ἐπιείκεια, which I would translate as humaneness. Because the law needs to keep things simple and can't cover all situations, it addresses only what is true universally or for the most part; but as Aristotle has said repeatedly, the truest judgment always resides in the particulars. Humaneness sets things straight [ἐπανόρθωμα] and speaks correctly [ὀρθῶς], making what is ill-defined under the law well-defined in action; thus it is more just than justice, as it were - it is the best form of justice, because it honors not the letter but the spirit of the law.</p>
<p>Stepping back from the often-boring details of Book V, as I've done here, enables us to see the dialectical trajectory that Aristotle takes in the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>. Looking backward, in IV.7 Aristotle had remarked that certain people are truthful in their words and deeds even when there's no advantage to be gained, since they act that way from an acquired character trait and take inherent pleasure in doing what's beautifully right (just as deceitful people take a perverse pleasure in lying, cf. NE 1127b16). And, as noted last time, in IV.8 he had said that "a free and gracious person will conduct his life this way, since he is like a law unto himself". The ethical person who takes life seriously doesn't consider mere legislation to be the ultimate guidance, but instead follows a higher law.</p>
<p>Looking forward, Aristotle's brief consideration of humaneness will lead in two separate but complementary directions. First, in Book VI he will delve deeply into deliberation, practical wisdom, and what makes for a correct account [ὀρθός λόγος] of our actions and feelings. Then, in Books VII and VIII he will thoroughly explore the even more complete humaneness present within love-and-friendship [φιλία] in all its forms. Glancing even further ahead, by the end of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> Aristotle will weave these two strands of wisdom and love back together when he shows that the love of wisdom (i.e., φιλο-σοφία) is absolutely essential to human fulfillment.</p>
<p>Having briefly previewed the rest of our walk through the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>, next time we'll pick up with Book VI on the so-called "intellectual virtues", with a special focus on practical wisdom.</p>

<h2><a href="1882.html">Walking with Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics IV.5-9</a></h2>
<h3>2024-07-13</h3>
<p>Following the intellectual drama of Aristotle's chapter on greatness of soul, the rest of Book IV covers gentleness (of which the contraries are an angry or docile disposition) and a few social excellences like benevolence, modesty, and wit. It might not be coincidental that all of these act as counterweights to the haughty arrogance we just witnessed in the great-souled man.</p>
<p>The discussion of gentleness and anger (IV.5) has several interesting wrinkles. For one, Aristotle observes that the gentle-minded person is undisturbed (atarachos) and not led by passions, using the same root word that Epicurus will later emphasize in his ethics of ataraxia. Here Aristotle also graphically illustrates the many ways that a person can go astray emotionally: the irritable person gets angry quickly and at the wrong kinds of people, but just as quickly cools off; the hot-head is sharp-tempered toward everyone; the bitter person doesn't let go of angry feelings; the harsh person gets angry for the wrong reasons; and so forth.</p>
<p>The social excellences that Aristotle considers in IV.6-8 are traditionally thought of as minor virtues, yet they set the stage for his exploration of justice in Book V and friendship/love (philia) in Books VII and VIII. All of them lend authenticity/truth (aletheia), decency/humaneness (epikeia), and grace/civility (charis) to social relations, living harmoniously, and sharing words and deeds with the other people in our daily life and community. They are not matters for legislation, but "a free and gracious person will conduct his life this way, since he is like a law unto himself" (NE 1128a31-32). Especially as he grows older, this kind of decent person won't experience feelings of shame because he won't engage in shameful acts in the first place - instead, in all the many and various situations of life he will deviate as little as possible from what is admirably appropriate and beautifully right.</p>
<p>At this point, having sketched out a number of character traits outside the traditional "big four" of ancient Greek culture, Aristotle will devote the entirety of Book V to an examination of justice. That's a large topic, so I'll probably split it into several different posts.</p>
