<h2><a href="1699.html">Jealousy and Envy</a></h2>
<h3>2022-02-10</h3>
<p>A friend recently asked me how I would characterize the difference between jealousy and envy. Here's how I see it: jealousy is when I want to gain something you have, and envy is when I want you to lose something you have. If I'm jealous of your new Tesla, I want a Tesla too. If I'm envious of the superyacht that Jeff Bezos is building, I don't want him to have that yacht even if I'll never be able to have such a thing.</p>
<p>There's a murky zone involving "rivalrous goods" that only one of us can possess. The classic case is love: if both you and I want to be married to the same person, in most cultures only one of us can win. The same could be true of promotions at work, political appointments, and the like. One way to look at these cases is to say that jealousy and envy overlap or that I'm feeling both jealousy and envy.</p>
<p>Because jealousy has a positive component (I want X) whereas envy seems purely negative (I don't want you to have Y), it strikes me that the remedies differ. When I feel jealousy, I can educate and temper my acquisitive desires to not want X (do I really "need" that shiny new Tesla?). When I feel envy, I can do a better job of accepting the good fortune of other people - even if it is excessive or undeserved (naturally, this can be especially hard to swallow!).</p>
<p>I'll end with my translation of a quote from Epicurus (Vatican Sayings #53):</p>
<blockquote>Envy no one. For good people do not deserve envy, and the more that wicked people succeed the more they ruin things for themselves.</blockquote>

<h2><a href="1698.html">Delphic Wisdom and Modern Science</a></h2>
<h3>2022-02-04</h3>
<p>Carved into the walls of the ancient Greek temple at Delphi were two proverbs: γνῶθι σεαυτόν ("know thyself") and μηδὲν ἄγαν ("nothing too much"). Plato mentions them in his dialogue Protagoras, set around 434 BCE, but most likely they were common among the Greeks as far back as 600 BCE or even earlier. Although they are so very old, recently I've been pondering their connection to the latest research in the modern science of psychology.</p>
<p>First, consider "know thyself". This has clear applications to personality psychology. In order to make use of the relevant scientific insights, you need to not only understand the theory but complete a valid, reliable personality inventory (preferably based on the five-factor model), and then reflect on how those personality traits are expressed in your attitudes and behavior. This gives you a store of self-knowledge that can guide better choices and decisions in your life.</p>
<p>Second, consider "nothing too much". The Positive Psychology movement has identified a number of character strengths that show up across most or all human cultures, and has created inventories that enable you to identify your greatest strengths. Although it might sound ideal to cultivate and leverage your strengths (say, empathy) at home and at work, psychological research has shown that it's all too easy to overplay your strengths. As one example, if all you do is empathize with others then you might accept mistreatment in an abusive relationship, overlook ethical lapses by your co-workers, or neglect to insist on effective performance by your employees. Too much of a good thing, indeed.</p>
<p>It strikes me that there's a tension between these two proverbs, because a key foundation for the rise of ancient Greek philosophy was the idea that you can never have too much wisdom or self-knowledge. But that's a topic for another day...</p>

<h2><a href="1697.html">Philosophical Professionalism</a></h2>
<h3>2022-02-01</h3>
<p>Robin Hanson recently suggested that we need more generalist thinkers, and that they can be found among the ranks of polymaths, public intellectuals, and professional philosophers. Although I might post again on the topic of generalists vs. specialists, today I'd like to focus instead on the concept of philosophical professionalism.</p>
<p>In most fields, a professional is one who gets paid to perform a task or offer a service; thus we speak of professional musicians or athletes as opposed to amateurs. We also say that certain lines of work are professions because they are preceded by long years of training or require certification or licensure: doctoring, nursing, lawyering, and the like. By extension, persons and activities are said to be professional if they meet certain standards of skill or expertise. Thus by "professional philosopher" Hanson likely means someone who has completed a PhD in philosophy, who teaches philosophy in a college or university, who publishes in academic philosophy journals, and so on (I doubt that he includes philosophical counselors).</p>
<p>How well do these notions of professionalism apply to philosophy in its deepest sense as the love and practice of wisdom? Here things get murky. For instance, Socrates, the archetypical philosopher in the Western tradition, wasn't a professional because he didn't seek or accept payment (as the Sophists did), nor did he receive training from recognized experts (which at that time I suppose would have been the selfsame Sophists). Furthermore, it's unclear how or whether today's standard academic training in philosophy - consisting as it does in the study of theoretical arguments, suitably analyzed and footnoted - leads to <em>wisdom</em>.</p>
<p>Indeed, what would it mean to practice wisdom <em>professionally</em>? Practicing wisdom itself seems quite different from practicing, say, law or medicine: there's no recognized body of knowledge and skills in which one can be trained and tested, there's no specific venue (such as a law court or hospital) in which one applies one's knowledge and skills, etc. An analogy with psychology might be more appropriate than that of academic philosophy, since there are theoretical psychologists, experimental psychologists, applied psychologists (e.g., in the workplace), and clinical psychologists (the closest thing to philosophical practitioners), etc.</p>
<p>And we won't even ask the provocative question of what it means to be a professional lover, of wisdom or anything else!</p>
<p>In the first chapter of <cite>Walden</cite>, Henry David Thoreau observed:</p>
<blockquote>There are nowadays professors of philosophy, but not philosophers. Yet it is admirable to profess because it was once admirable to live. To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically.</blockquote>
<p>You don't need a PhD or a university position or a long list of academic publications to "solve some of the problems of life" and to "live according to the dictates of wisdom". Although professor Martha Nussbaum once said that a philosopher is a professional human being, I would hope that being human is not the kind of thing that can or should be professionalized: it's the birthright of every person on the planet to exercise their highest potential by loving and practicing wisdom in their own life to the greatest extent possible.</p>

<h2><a href="1696.html">The Underlying Theme</a></h2>
<h3>2022-01-27</h3>
<p>In a comment on my recent post about Aristotle on ways of life, my friend Kurt wondered if, according to Aristotle, the best life must have a single purpose (in Greek, a <em>telos</em>). I would say so: at the very beginning of the <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite>, he says that it is a sign of great folly to not organize your life around some <em>telos</em>. Yet I think this can be interpreted in several different ways.</p>
<p>Consider, for instance, Johann Sebastian Bach (whose Cello Suites I'm transcribing for the electric bass). Perhaps no one in history has pursued as deeply as Bach what we might call "music as a way of life" (indeed, Wilfred Mellers used exactly this phrase in his book <cite>Bach and the Dance of God</cite>). Bach was steeped in music almost from birth within the extended Bach family of musicians, he studied music with extraordinary intensity throughout his life, he was a master of numerous keyboard instruments, he absorbed and integrated and extended every previous style of Western art music, he composed prolifically and originally in every musical genre except opera, when he wasn't performing music or composing music he was teaching music, and on and on. To borrow a term from literary theory, the plot of his life was music, music, and more music. Yet what was the theme? I'd say it was religious devotion; as one small sign of this, consider that at the end of every one of his compositions he wrote the following phrase: Soli Deo Gloria ("to God alone the glory").</p>
<p>When Aristotle talks about the life of "politics" (active engagement in your community) or of "theoria" (active inquiry into the nature of things), he doesn't mean that your every waking moment is spent in political or theoretical pursuits, even if that were possible for a human being. Instead he means, I think, that those chosen values provide the primary purpose or overall orientation or animating principle or deepest meaning of all aspects of your life - its underlying theme (queue "Limelight" by Rush). It's not that, say, your relationships with those you love completely lack independent value or are merely means to an end - you still value them on their own terms, but you also tend to view them in the light of that theme. Your life still has a varied portfolio of activities and values, but they all fit together thematically.</p>
<p>This seems clearest under religious conceptions of life. In part what Pierre Hadot was getting at in his conception of philosophy as a way of life is that here, too, one can experience the kind of commitment that religions inspire. For instance, the famous first sentence of Aristotle's <cite>Metaphysics</cite> reads: "all human beings by nature reach out for knowledge", which perhaps reveals more about his own psychology than that of people in general; to put it another way, John Herman Randall once said that Aristotle's life was guided by "the passionate search for passionless truth". That search illuminated everything he did; even if it was not his only value, it was the overriding one, the underlying theme of his existence.</p>
<p>This interaction between theme and plot is not limited to philosophers: although a great entrepreneur might make a lot of money or a great artist might become famous, if the money and fame don't corrupt them they're primarily dedicated to building great companies or creating great art (similarly for those in the professions or the trades, or even a low-status orderly in a hospital - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi uses this example in his book <cite>Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</cite>).</p>
<p>Here as always it's not necessarily straightforward to find a beautifully right balance between what Aristotle might call the "material" of your life and its form or purpose - after all, if it were easy everyone would do it! But I do think such a balance is worth aspiring to.</p>

<h2><a href="1695.html">Aristotle on Ways of Life</a></h2>
<h3>2022-01-24</h3>
<p>While I'm reflecting on philosophies and ways of life, I thought it would be interesting to look at what Aristotle says about ways of life in his writings on ethics.</p>
<p>First, he states that there is a fundamentally human way of life or bios (it always helps to remember that Aristotle founded the science of biology, i.e., the formal study of the bios of living things). Human beings are social animals whose activities are characterized by speech-and-reason (logos). Thus, for instance, a being that leads an utterly solitary existence could not be a human being, but would be either a god or a beast.</p>
<p>Second, within the fundamentally human way of life Aristotle delineates four particular forms of living that have a primary focus: the life of money-making, of pleasure-seeking, of political engagement, or of theoretical inquiry. He quickly dismisses the life of money-making. Why? The way I see it, he's engaging in a thought experiment: if you had enough money to live on, what would you do? He thinks it's absurd to say "I'd make more money" because that is a path without any natural limits. (More on this in a future post.)</p>
<p>This leaves the three lives of pleasure, politics, or inquiry. But why just these three? Why not also lives of family relations, artistic creation, religious devotion, professional service, philanthropy, invention, entrepreneurship, etc.? I see a few possible and perhaps overlapping explanations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of our modern ways of life were simply not an option 2400 years ago (e.g., entrepreneurship in our sense of creating value through companies didn't exist).</li>
<li>He denigrated certain ways of life (e.g., even though Aristotle was a parent - unlike, I'll note, Plato and many other ancient philosophers - he seems to have thought that homelife was second best).</li>
<li>He might have thought that some ways of life can be subsumed under pleasure, politics, and inquiry. For instance, he came from a long line of doctors and he might have seen medicine as a combination of social service and theoretical investigation. Similarly, the political life (literally, life in a polis or community) could be seen as a philanthropic endeavor.</li>
</ul>
<p>To amplify on my previous post, the sense of "way of life" used here is different from the sense in "philosophy as a way of life", because every philosophical school falls under the latter rather than the former. Yet there could be interesting relationships between these senses: for example, Stoicism lends itself to the political life whereas Epicureanism lends itself to a certain life of pleasure.</p>
<p>Finally, nothing says it's necessary to dedicate all of your activities to a singular focus: it seems at least possible to, say, make money as a nurse while raising a family or pursuing music in your spare time. This points in the direction of what I think of as a "portfolio management" approach to life, but that's a topic for another post as well.</p>

<h2><a href="1694.html">Philosophies and Ways of Life</a></h2>
<h3>2022-01-21</h3>
<p>In his book <cite>What Is Ancient Philosophy?</cite>, Pierre Hadot almost singlehandedly resurrected the ancient conception of philosophy as a way of life. Consider this observation about the philosophical schools of Greece and Rome: "For us moderns, the notion of a philosophical school evokes only the idea of a doctrinal tendency or theoretical position. Things were very different in antiquity. No university obligations oriented the future philosopher toward a specific school; instead, the future philosopher came to attend classes in the school of his choice as a function of the way of life practiced there."</p>
<p>Yet there is an ambiguity here. When in ancient times you chose to join, say, the school of the Stoics, you chose everything associated with that way of life: you wore Stoic clothing, shaved your head in Stoic style, read Stoic books, admired Stoic heroes, made Stoic friends, studied with Stoic teachers, and of course accepted Stoic philosophy. But which was primary: the way of life or the philosophy? Did you really adopt <em>philosophy</em> as a way of life, or only <em>Stoicism</em> as a way of life?</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a false alternative. It certainly seems that you can pursue wisdom and truth primarily or solely within a given tradition, as did Marcus Aurelius within Stoicism (see his <cite>Meditations</cite>) or as did many sages and worthies over the centuries within Confucianism (one fine example is <cite>The Journal of Wu Yubi</cite> as translated by M. Theresa Kelleher). On the other hand, committing to a particular creed as a way of life rather than to a generalized pursuit of wisdom as a way of life might limit how successful you can be as a human being, in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Partisanship is an ever-present threat, since those around you might denigrate all of the other schools. (Indeed, the Hellenistic schools that Hadot lauds also tended to viciously attack each other.)</li>
<li>Because no school of thought can be comprehensive, you might miss out on the unique contributions of other schools. This is not merely a doctrinal failing: by ignoring virtues emphasized by other schools, you might not be as successful in living a good human life.</li>
<li>If there are universal truths, then presumably reason can discover them outside the context of any particular school; this is the intellectual promise of, for example, Aristotelian dialectic (which attempts to accurately weigh the value of insights from every school).</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I've learned a great deal by studying a wide variety of wisdom traditions and I continue to do so. But one could argue that perhaps I'm missing out on some of their deepest insights, since those would require total immersion. Unfortunately, there are tradeoffs in everything, including philosophy as a way of life!</p>
