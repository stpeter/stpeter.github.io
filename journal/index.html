<h2><a href="1797.html">Philosophical Parsimony</a></h2>
<h3>2023-07-10</h3>
<p>If "say implies do" - if the beliefs that you profess are constrained by consistency with the behaviors you enacts - then doesn't that severely limit the scope of philosophical speculation?</p>
<p>Indeed it does. That's a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>As I've explored before, many people conceive philosophy as a way of life to work like this: some great thinker initiates a school of thought, and its adherents identify with those ideas so strongly that they do whatever they must to put them into practice. It's a one-way street from leader to followers.</p>
<p>Although that model can help the adherents learn from the wisdom of the founder, it can also lead to all sorts of distortions if the adherents take that wisdom for certainty; a prime example is personal suppression of thoughts and behaviors that are not completely consistent with the original theory. Consider, for example, the very human phenomenon of grief. The ancient Stoics discouraged grieving, even going so far as to assert that you don't grieve over a broken cup, so why do you grieve over the loss of a spouse or child? Although that position is, to my mind, literally inhuman, an adherent of Stoicism might feel guilty about not living up to it.</p>
<p>Better, I think, to make sure that traffic on the street also flows in the other direction, so that you assent to a principle only if it arises from within your existing practice. This leads to a healthy sort of philosophical parsimony, a wisdom that is aligned with life as you live it. This approach to philosophy is almost scientific in its austerity, since theory must always align with the evidence of life.</p>
<p>Even better is a two-way street, in which wisdom and practice exist in a mutually reinforcing dialectic of continual learning and self-improvement. In my experience, this works best if I open myself to insights from many different schools of thought, since most of them have grasped some but not all of the truth in human affairs. By deeply encountering various thinkers and judiciously attempting to put their ideas into practice, I determine for myself whether I will accept their insights as part of my chosen wisdom.</p>
<p>In Book X of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>, Aristotle makes two statements that comport with this dialectical vision:</p>
<blockquote>True arguments seem most useful, not only with a view to knowledge, but with a view to life also; for since they harmonize with the facts they are believed, and so they stimulate those who understand them to live according to them.</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>The truth in practical matters is discerned from the facts of life; for these are the decisive factor. We must therefore survey what we have already said, bringing it to the test of the facts of life, and if it harmonizes with the facts we must accept it, but if it clashes with them we must suppose it to be mere theory.</blockquote>
<p>If more thinkers pursued this approach to the love and practice of wisdom, they would be more successful at threading a middle path and thus avoiding extreme opinions such as the Stoic position on grief. Although I don't expect that philosophical theorists will change their stripes, it's a policy that those who engage in the examined life can readily accept.</p>

<h2><a href="1796.html">Behavior and Belief</a></h2>
<h3>2023-07-08</h3>
<p>A few years ago when I needed to fly across the country to attend to some urgent family matters, I spotted an older woman at the airport wearing a button that said "I'm With Greta." The irony is that if she really were with Greta and believed, in the marrow of her bones, that human activity is causing a climate emergency, she wouldn't have been about to board an airplane, since jet travel is just about the worst thing you can do to generate greenhouse gases. In a similar vein, I've heard friends say how much they want to fly to Italy so that they can visit Venice before it is inundated by rising sea levels (caused in no small part by so many people flying to Italy so that they can visit Venice before it is inundated by rising sea levels). And don't get me started on the thousands of activists and bureaucrats who fly around the world to attend climate conferences.</p>
<p>To be clear, my observation is not limited to climate catastrophists: it applies equally well to Christian ministers who pontificate about traditional values while cheating on their wives, to economics professors who espouse anarcho-capitalism while teaching at state universities, to politicians who agitate for gun control while employing armed bodyguards, and so on. There's no monopoly on hypocrisy!</p>
<p>My favorite recent example is Peter Singer, Ira W. DeCamp Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University. Singer is famous for, among other things, his academic paper "Famine, Affluence, and Morality", in which he argued that "if it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it." Inspired by Singer's doctrine, an effective altruist organization called GiveWell determined that if you donate $5,000 to prevent malaria infection, you will save the life of one child in the developing world. So let's do the math. Singer teaches at Princeton, where the cost of tuition, room, and board for one year is almost $80,000 (granted, many students don't pay that much, but we'll go with the sticker price). Thus a student who attends Princeton for 4 years could have saved the lives of 65 children instead of obtaining a college diploma. Because Princeton has about 5,300 undergraduates, if all those students decided to forego a Princeton education, they could save almost 340,000 lives for each (non-)graduating class. Thus we can conclude that, since joining Princeton in 1999, Singer is complicit in the deaths of an astounding 8+ million children!</p>
<p>Yes, I am exaggerating, perhaps even unfairly. Maybe one could argue that, from his powerful position at Princeton, Singer is able to save even more than 8 million lives through the reach of his teachings and writings. But it's unclear to me if Singer's academic sinecure is really of "comparable moral importance" to less prestigious career paths he might have taken in order to "prevent something bad from happening."</p>
<p>Snarky examples aside, my broader question is this: can we really say that you believe something in the marrow of your bones if you don't behave in a way that's consistent with the belief you profess?</p>
<p>I grant that there are degrees of inconsistency; not every divergence between what you say and what you do rises to the level of hypocrisy, which is a serious charge of moral failing. Yet, to my mind, belief necessitates behavior; going far beyond Kant's dictum "ought implies can", we could posit that "say implies do."</p>
<p>In <cite>Walden</cite>, Thoreau wrote:</p>
<blockquote>To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically.</blockquote>
<p>In the end it comes down to philosophy in its original sense: do you so love wisdom as to live according to its dictates? All else is sound and fury, signifying nothing.</p>

<h2><a href="1795.html">Mind the Gap</a></h2>
<h3>2023-07-08</h3>
<p>In my recent post about discovering the best we can do, I mentioned the inevitability of a gap between the ideal and the real, especially for those who have high standards of personal behavior. This leads to the question: how do you figure out where you fall short?</p>
<p>In my experience this isn't always easy, for several reasons. First, we all like to think well of ourselves (self-deception is the easiest thing in the world), so we might not be eager to identify those gaps. Second, we live in a culture that celebrates people's strengths, but avoids talking about failings, faults, or flaws, let alone vices and sins - such antiquated moralizing! Third, not only is it difficult to be honest with ourselves, but it's also difficult to convince family, friends, colleagues, and other people to be honest with us.</p>
<p>One way around these obstacles, at least in the business world, is the 360˚ assessment, wherein people you work with are asked to anonymously rate you on key behaviors (e.g., delegation and communication). Another technique is to actively seek out feedback from people you interact with, for instance after you give a presentation or facilitate a brainstorming session.</p>
<p>When it comes to more subtle aspects of behavior, there's no substitute for emotional awareness in relation to yourself and others. As far as I can see, this comes in three primary flavors: monitoring yourself for unhealthy emotions such as anger, closely watching how other people react to what you say and do, and comparing yourself to people you interact with in person or read about in literature or biographies so that you can acquire their admirable traits or avoid their negative ones.</p>
<p>Naturally, this assumes that you have a modicum of emotional awareness in the first place. Over the course of my career, I worked with several people who seemed to be utterly lacking in emotional awareness; indeed, earlier in life I bore an uncanny resemblance to such people. I can't exactly explain how I pulled myself out of that hole, other than to say that at some point in my twenties I became dissatisfied with myself and formed the vague ambition to be a better person. Even then, it took me a long time to improve. Yes, that gap is still there, but at least it's not nearly as wide as it once was.</p>

<h2><a href="1794.html">The Best We Can Do</a></h2>
<h3>2023-07-04</h3>
<p>Here's a further thought about the examined life, which the other day I summarized as "The best way to live is to never stop asking yourself: What is the best way to live?" Implicit in that formulation is a focus on personal improvement, for it involves continually asking yourself "Is this the best I can do?" For someone with high ethical ideals, the answer is always "not quite" because there is always a gap between the ideal and the real. Having those ideals gives us something to strive for. As I like say, "You don't have to achieve an ideal to realize the benefits of idealism."</p>
<p>The same applies, I might add, at the societal level. Today is America's 247th birthday. These days many people focus on what's wrong with America and her history. But that's nothing new. From the very start, many Americans knew that there was a large gap, perhaps even a yawning chasm, between the American ideals expressed in the Declaration of Independence and the American reality of slavery. Even before the Constitution was ratified in 1787, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Rhode Island had passed emancipation laws. At his death in 1799, George Washington, alone among the founders, liberated the slaves he had inherited. As a society, every once in a while we've had to ask ourselves if this is the best we can do, and we've found ourselves wanting - resulting in the Civil War, Reconstruction and subsequent backsliding, the abolition of the Jim Crow laws, the civil rights movement, and most recently yet another racial reckoning (not to mention women's suffrage and numerous other corrections).</p>
<p>You might think that we should have solved all of our problems by now, but history doesn't work that way. As Alexis de Tocqueville once said, "The greatness of America lies not in being more enlightened than any other nation, but rather in her ability to repair her faults." I remain optimistic that we Americans can live up to our ideals. In any case, because utopia is not an option, continuing to repair our faults is literally the best we can do.</p>
<p>This loops right back around to the personal: what is the best that I can do as an individual? Many people find it easier to rail against societal problems than to engage in the most difficult reform of all: the inner revolution of self-improvement. In today's climate of ideological extremism, that necessitates political moderation, truly educating yourself about American history and present-day society, and identifying opportunities to make a difference in your community. Therein lies the only long-term path to closing the gap between the ideal and the real.</p>

<h2><a href="1793.html">Certainty</a></h2>
<h3>2023-07-02</h3>
<p>In my post the other day about the examined life, I observed that some people are certain about their answers to the great questions of life. By contrast, those of a Socratic bent typically doubt that certainty is likely or even possible. The standard rejoinder is this: "It sounds like you're certain that certainty is impossible." Quite the conundrum.</p>
<p>For myself, over time I've become less certain about most things theoretical. Life is complex, and it's difficult to unambiguously define and unpack concepts like courage or justice. Indeed, Aristotle argued that it's foolish to strive for more precision in a domain like ethics than can be reasonably expected. The reason is that we can't merely rely on theory: we need practical wisdom to help us sort out the messy realities we face every day.</p>
<p>At the same time that I've become less certain about most theories, I've become more certain about some facts - even or especially facts with ethical implications, such as that human beings are social animals for whom family, friendship, and community are central features of a human way of life. Similarly for phenomena such as language, discourse, emotion, memory, forethought, and imagination, which undergird excellent practices like empathy, reflection, and deliberation.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the pursuit of certainty has caused endless havoc for societies, organizations, and individuals, in the form of religious dogmas, political absolutism, and overly rigid rules of behavior. Yet perhaps we've been looking for certainty in all the wrong places: perhaps certainty is not to be found in the theoretical clouds, but right here on earth in the deeply human interactions that ground our lives. So here's a heretical thought: the truly philosophical life might require a lot less theory focused on faraway abstractions and a lot more practice focused on what is near and dear.</p>

<h2><a href="1792.html">The Examined Life</a></h2>
<h3>2023-06-29</h3>
<p>All the great questions of life boil down to this: What is the best way to live?</p>
<p>The great questions of life include the ones that Socrates posed 2400 year ago: what is courage? what is moderation? what is justice? what is love? what is beauty? what is truth? what is wisdom?</p>
<p>The great questions also include more modern concerns, such as how best to make a living, to find one's calling, or to interact with technology (topics that much exercised Thoreau, for instance).</p>
<p>I suppose that some people don't think about the great questions - instead they skate or slouch or sleepwalk through life, unaware of the deeper themes of human existence.</p>
<p>Others are certain that the great questions have straightforward answers, inherited from a particular creed or religion or cultural tradition.</p>
<p>Socrates often undercut such people's certainty by haranguing them in the Athenian agora. Eventually they got tired of him and put him to death. Yet Socrates had the last laugh: no one remembers his accusers, but they do remember his admonition that the unexamined life is not worth living for a human being. In more positive terms we could phrase it like this: "The best way to live is to never stop asking yourself: What is the best way to live?"</p>
