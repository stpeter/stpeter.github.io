<h2><a href="1806.html">Tao Te Ching ยง11: Emptiness</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-03</h3>
<p>Following up on yesterday's post about the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite>, here's another poem that I might set to music (chapter 11 in the standard order). My provisional rendering is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
Some thirty spokes meet in one hub<br>
Through emptiness it does its work<br>
Throw clay and shape it to a jar<br>
Through emptiness it does its work<br>
Cut doors and windows, make a room<br>
Through emptiness it does its work
<br><br>
The craftsman profits from its mass<br>
And yet it works through emptiness
</blockquote>
<p>At only 8 lines, it would make for an extremely short song. But that might be the nature of this project!</p>
<p>In this poem we glimpse the paradoxical side of Taoism. To my mind it suggests an aesthetic appreciation for subtlety, silence, simplicity, austere beauty, and what must be left unsaid - the space between the notes, if you will. Indeed, this poem raises the possibility that the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite> itself might do its work through emptiness, for if the philosophical is the personal then (as chapter 1 puts it) "the way that we can say is not the ageless Way" and "the name that we can name is not the ageless Name".</p>
<p>But how could this be? Isn't the ageless something abstract and far away? Perhaps; but perhaps instead it's something tangible and near: the abiding ways of living that human beings have engaged in for as long as we have been on this beautiful earth of ours.</p>

<h2><a href="1805.html">Tao Te Ching ยง1: The Gateway</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-02</h3>
<p>For many years I have admired, and puzzled over, the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite>. This classic text of Chinese philosophy is wise, poetic, suggestive, paradoxial, even inscrutable. Because I don't know classical Chinese, I'm forced to read multiple translations - a task made easy by the fact that it's one of the most translated works in all of world literature. Yet, not knowing the original language, I'm always unsure whether I really understand its message. It's one of my "best friend books" and I return to it every few years.</p>
<p>Each of the 81 chapters of the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite> consists of a short poem. Recently I've formed the ambition of setting some of these poems to music. The inspiration for this somewhat unusual project is the Beatles song "The Inner Light", in which George Harrison used a translation of chapter 47 of the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite> (with slight adjustments) as his text.</p>
<p>The first step for each song is to settle on the lyrics. Somewhat boldly, I've decided to make my own renderings by triangulating among available translations. Here, for instance, is my version of chapter 1, which I've entitled "The Gateway"...</p>
<blockquote>
The way that we can say is not the ageless Way<br>
The name that we can name is not the ageless Name<br>
From that which has no name, came Heaven and came Earth<br>
From that which we can name, all things have had their birth
<br><br>
Never yearning, we see the way things are<br>
Ever yearning, we see but what appears<br>
Born together, these differ but in name<br>
See their oneness, a mystery indeed
<br><br>
The mystery of mysteries<br>
The gateway to all wonder
</blockquote>
<p>We see here some of the signature themes of Taoism: the presence of an ageless Way underlying all heaven and earth; the gap between our names for things and their true natures; the urgent need to let go of yearnings and cravings so that we can live in harmony with the Way; the improbable unity of the abstract or universal and the particular or personal; and what Socrates too recognized as the origins of philosophy in the experience of wonder.</p>
<p>As to the resulting song, I'll endeavor to make a rough recording in the near future.</p>

<h2><a href="1804.html">The Republic of Letters</a></h2>
<h3>2023-07-31</h3>
<p>About 600 years ago, some farsighted intellectual explorers in Europe created a long-distance communication network they called the Republic of Letters; indeed, it was almost something like a network of networks (an internet!), since it connected local networks in various towns and cities with each other. The way it worked is that individual people would exchange handwritten letters and manuscripts, and eventually printed pamphlets and books, with correspondents in other parts of the network. Those correspondents would then write back to the original sender and also share insights with others to whom they were connected (whether local or distant). It was also expected that participants would help to grow the network by recruiting new members. This network, which flourished from about 1400 to 1800, played a significant role in fostering the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the early Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the Republic of Letters was the individual and collective advancement of knowledge, both theoretical and practical. Toward that end, the participants committed themselves to certain core principles, which we could describe as follows: reflection, not reaction; reason, not emotion; respect, not contempt; conversation, not argument; learning, not partisanship; and upholding the highest standards of clarity in writing (mostly in Latin because that was the universal language of Europe back then).</p>
<p>Now consider how far the Republic of Letters is from our current modes of interaction over the Internet, especially in so-called social media apps. Unlike those pioneers of knowledge who were supremely dedicated to building a better world, we now inhabit a living hell of emotivistic reaction, mutual contempt, and partisan vitriol, too often expressed in expletives and insults. And don't get me started on our seemingly inexorable slide into a post-literate society.</p>
<p>Is there hope? Perhaps. We still have people who write intelligent essays, blogs, newsletters, papers, and books. Twitter (X?) and its ilk are a mess, but there's always the possibility that someone will create a communication app designed to lift participants up to a higher standard rather than pull them down to the lowest common denominator. If I were building such an app, I might consider the following features: words only, no images or videos; something like a 200-word minimum on posts; a 24-hour delay in posting so that people don't write with undue heat; posts only, no comments; no like button; no repost button; no sponsored posts; no centrally-controlled algorithms for the primary interface; relatively small conversation groups (say, 15 people), consistent with Robin Dunbar's insights into human interaction; and perhaps even smaller, 5-person learning teams focused on solving particular problems or intensively exploring particular topics.</p>
<p>Even if someone doesn't offer such an app, we can behave as if they had by avoiding the social media sewer and committing ourselves to moderation and reasonableness when interacting with our fellow citizens of the intellectual republic. It's worth a try, anyway!</p>

<h2><a href="1803.html">Always Be Reading</a></h2>
<h3>2023-07-30</h3>
<p>In my recent post about the value of re-reading, I mentioned that I regularly seek out new books and authors. For me, at least, here's how that works.</p>
<p>I have two kinds of reading program. The first kind is related to books I'm writing, or at least thinking about writing; here I might have dozens or hundreds of books and scholarly papers on a project-specific reading list, which I keep adding to as I look at the bibliographies of whatever I've read so far (note: I love bibliographies). I won't further discuss this kind of reading program here, since it's rather specialized.</p>
<p>The second kind is my general program of self-education, which I've been pursuing for decades. Since I'm curious about many different fields of knowledge, my main reading list contains books of philosophy, psychology, anthropology, history, art, music, poetry, literature, biography, and so on. I'm continually adding to this list as I read other books (see above about bibliographies), see mentions of books and authors in published essays, ask friends about books and authors they like, and so on.</p>
<p>Although I feel no compulsion to read all the literary classics, I do try to expose myself over time to more of the great novelists (e.g., I'm working my way through the novels of George Eliot) and especially the poets.</p>
<p>I also endeavor to learn more about different human cultures, past and present. Often I do this by reading books of poetry and philosophy because I like those genres best - even better is the overlap between the two. Sometimes I read general histories of various countries or time periods (e.g., I would like to read a few good books about the French Revolution). And I'll admit that I have a soft spot for books of mega-history that trace changes over the long sweep of history.</p>
<p>Occasionally I get somewhat obsessed by a topic and read many books about it; for instance, some 15 years ago I read a whole bunch of books about the history and sources of the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>I don't like memoirs, but I do like biographies, with a focus on biographies that might help me learn to become a better person. Right now I'm reading Ron Chernow's biography of George Washington, after which I plan to read the new biography of Martin Luther King, Jr., by Jonathan Eig.</p>
<p>Finally, although it might seem that my reading program is somewhat rarified in its focus on abstract topics, I do also try to keep abreast of current trends; usually this happens through long-form essays, but sometimes I check out books on such topics, too (most recently, for example, Jean Twenge's book <cite>Generations</cite>). Because many such books have way too many pages (they should have been long-form essays!), I often start with the last chapter and return them to the library if they don't seem worth reading in their entirety.</p>
<p>All this means that I always have hundreds of books on my reading lists (yes, I keep multiple lists). Because I average only about 80 books a year, I'll never get through it all. But who would want to? Reading is one of the great pleasures of life and it's a joy to always be reading.</p>

<h2><a href="1802.html">The Value of Re-Reading</a></h2>
<h3>2023-07-26</h3>
<p>Not only do I read a lot, but I also re-read a lot. For instance, so far this year I've re-read the sonnets and a few plays by Shakespeare, three novels by Victor Hugo, the complete poems of Emily Dickinson, several Plato dialogues, and a few of my favorite children's books (<cite>The Wonderful O</cite> by James Thurber and <cite>The Phantom Tollbooth</cite> by Norton O. Juster); plus I'm in the midst of re-reading <cite>The Importance of Living</cite> by Lin Yutang as well as the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite>.</p>
<p>Why revisit books you've read before? And which books make for the best kind of re-reading?</p>
<p>Let me use Emily Dickinson as an example. I've read her complete poems four or five times, over a span of more than twenty years (my first blog post about her was written in 2001). Early on I preferred poems of hers that are brighter, happier, or more immediately striking, such as "I'm nobody! Who are you?", "Tell all the truth but tell it slant", and "Touch lightly nature's sweet guitar". As I've grown older, I've come to treasure many of her darker, sadder, quieter poems, too. Indeed, she has helped me appreciate and accept the significance of phenomena such as death and heartache, about which she wrote repeatedly, almost obsessively. I likely wasn't ready for those poems in my early thirties, but by sticking with Emily I've been able to learn from her.</p>
<p>Naturally, this wouldn't have been possible if she weren't such an amazing poet. One doesn't typically stick with an author if she isn't very good.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't mean one must restrict one's reading to books that are considered to be the greatest of all time; how much an author resonates with you is far more important than the grandness of their reputation. I prefer Hugo to Tolstoy and Thoreau to Kant, and I don't give a whit about their reputed differences in quality.</p>
<p>One caveat: what resonates with you can change over time. I didn't like Plato when I was 20 years old, but now I find his dialogues quite fascinating. Although I doubt that I'll revisit the impenetrable Kant, I won't rule it out.</p>
<p>Finally, I do also regularly expose myself to authors who are new to me. Perhaps I'll write a post about the value of literary and intellectual exploration...</p>

<h2><a href="1801.html">The Importance of Living</a></h2>
<h3>2023-07-24</h3>
<p>Twelve years ago when I was in Taipei for a weeklong standardization meeting, I snuck off one morning to visit the former home of Lin Yutang, where I bought a copy of his 1937 masterpiece <cite>The Importance of Living</cite>. Every few years I dip into this book, and each time I'm reminded of things I never should have forgotten. What a treasure it is! I definitely need to add it to my list of best friend books.</p>
<p>This time around, I got hooked by reading one of the essays toward the end (not "The True Aim of Education" but "Why I Am a Pagan") and decided to start over from the beginning. Throughout, Lin provides deep insights and charming anecdotes that illustrate what he aptly calls the importance of living. Not for him philosophical theory divorced from our common humanity and the pursuit of happiness; rather, he knows that wisdom has no value if lacks practical applications or is not enjoyable for its own sake. He is such a master of personalism and "what is near" that I'm tempted to call him not Lin but Lin-tse (or "Master Lin") on the model of the great Chinese Taoists Lao-tse and Chuang-tse. An absolute delight!</p>
