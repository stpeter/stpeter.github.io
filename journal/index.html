<h2><a href="1953.html">The Nation of Many Nations</a></h2>
<h3>2025-04-15</h3>
<p>In <cite>Song of Myself</cite>, Walt Whitman declared himself to be "one of the great nation, the nation of many nations" - claiming identity as a northerner and a southerner, a Yankee, a Kentuckian, a Hoosier, a Badger, a Buckeye, and a habitan of numerous other places in North America. (Whitman contained multitudes, after all!)</p>
<p>Aside from its 50 states and many larger and smaller regions, there is another, greater sense in which America is the nation of many nations: it has become a home for people from all over the world. First of these, of course, were the Native Americans, who were here before everyone else and whose tragedies and triumphs are ongoing. Long millennia later the British showed up, but the British were themselves a people of many cultures, with ancestral streams from the Celts, Romans, Angles, Saxons, Vikings, Norman French, etc. In his magisterial history <cite>Albion's Seed</cite>, David Hackett Fischer described the nature of America's founding cultures in great detail: dissenting Puritans who came from East Anglia to New England; low-church Anglican cavaliers and indentured servants who came from Wessex and Sussex to Virginia and the Carolinas; Quakers who came from the North Midlands to the Delaware Valley; and Presbyterians who came from Ulster and the Scottish-English Borderland to the Appalachian backcountry.</p>
<p>But that was merely the beginning. Fischer has since written a book about America's African founders (which I've not yet read). Russell Shorto has written several books about the influence of the Dutch upon New Amsterdam, which became our greatest city. These early migrations to mainland America have been followed over the centuries by significant influxes from Germany, Sweden, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, French Canada (both Québec and Acadia), China, Poland, Japan, Puerto Rico, Cuba, the Philippines, the many islands of the Caribbean, Vietnam, Mexico, India, Nigeria - the list goes on. No doubt books have been written about each one of these, and it would be fascinating to explore them all.</p>
<p>This gives me the idea of writing a long, Whitmanesque poem - perhaps entitled "Song of the Nations" - celebrating the contributions of people from all over the world to American history and culture. Yet another of my many projects...</p>

<h2><a href="1952.html">Four Causes of Fulfillment</a></h2>
<h3>2025-04-11</h3>
<p>Aristotle is famous, or infamous, for what is known as his doctrine of the four causes. As I’ve explained before, there are many misconceptions about these matters, but I’ll go with the traditional description for the purpose of this somewhat fanciful post about what causes an examined life of wisdom and fulfillment.</p>
<p>First is the material cause. This is that “out of which” a thing is made: a tree is made out of wood, a syllable is made out of letters, an argument is made out of premises, and a play is made out scenes. Similarly, life is made out of words and deeds, actions and emotions, projects and relationships, and everything else one experiences between birth and death. Thus metaphorically we can say that experience provides the wood.</p>
<p>Second is the efficient cause. This is that “from which” a change or motion begins: parents make a child, a builder (or the craft of house-building) makes a house, and so on. What is the efficient cause of a lifetime of seeking wisdom and fulfillment? Following Socrates and Plato, Aristotle says that it’s the experience of wonder about the mysteries of life and the universe. Thus metaphorically we can say that, after experience provides the wood, wonder lights the spark for good.</p>
<p>Third is the formal cause. This is “what it is to be something” - something’s identity or, more generally, its way of being. An example that Aristotle uses is the octave in music: what it is to be an octave is to have a ratio of two to one. A more familiar example might be a house, for which the formal cause is the architectural plan according to which the house was built. What forms a life of wisdom and fulfillment? At the highest level, Aristotle says it is philosophy, for as Pierre Hadot observed the purpose of philosophy is not to inform us but to form us. Thus metaphorically we can say that the love of wisdom shapes the flame of our pursuit of deep fulfillment in life.</p>
<p>Fourth is the final cause. This is that “for the sake of which” something acts within its way of being or, especially (since living beings are the paradigmatic entities), its way of life. Sometimes this is a conscious purpose, but Aristotle argues that even things like trees and insects have aims because the things they do (e.g., metabolic functions) are for the sake of the entity’s continued existence. In human life, Aristotle holds that the highest purpose is doing what is beautiful and thus emulating or enacting the most divine aspects of existence. Thus metaphorically we can say that, once the spark has been lit, beauty is the fire’s aim.</p>
<p>We can summarize these insights in a poetic quatrain:</p>
<blockquote>
Experience provides the wood,<br>
Then wonder lights the spark for good;<br>
The love of wisdom shapes the flame,<br>
For beauty is the fire’s aim.<br>

<h2><a href="1951.html">He Who Pays the Piper Calls the Tune</a></h2>
<h3>2025-04-09</h3>
<p>Recently my alma mater, Columbia University, was back in the news because the Trump administration threatened to withhold $400 million in federal grants until the university changed some of its internal polocies. The political responses were predictable: populists were pleased about sticking it to leftist academics, faculty fulminated about threats to their intellectual freedom, the interim president lost her job over decisions she made, and a few folks quietly wondered about the wisdom of federal funding for so much educational activity and scientific research.</p>
<p>Because all that political stuff is far outside my influence and control, my reaction is more personal and philosophical: an event like this reinforces my policy of what I call self-patronage. I have always funded my intellectual and artistic endeavors through my own independent means, never through academic positions, think-tank paychecks, non-profit grants, wealthy patrons, crowdfunded donations, paid subscriptions, or anything other than the money I earned in my business career. As I see it, one can’t maintain true freedom of thought - the deep foundation underlying mere freedom of speech - if someone else is footing the bill.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, those who are now surprised that a new paymaster might make new demands forgot the wisdom of an ancient saying: <em>he who pays the piper calls the tune</em>.</p>

<h2><a href="1950.html">Where I Stand</a></h2>
<h3>2025-04-08</h3>
<p>Spurred by Garry Kasparov's call for a positive vision of the free society, Arnold Kling posted a list of the causes he is for. It seems like a good idea to reflect on these matters from time to time - perhaps especially at this time. Therefore - while recognizing both that I'm politically powerless and that my views have significance only for me - here I'll very briefly set out ten principles that I hold to be important in the political realm.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ethics. My ideal president is George Washington, a leader who had the highest principles of personal conduct along with an unwavering devotion to public service.</li>
  <li>Freedom. The American ideals espoused in the Declaration of Independence are eminently worth preserving, fighting for, and extending to more aspects of our society.</li>
  <li>Opportunity. Too many Americans have precious little opportunity to advance in life because of horrendous schools, unsafe neighborhoods, welfare programs that actively discourage moving up into the middle class, etc. We pay lip service to addressing these problems, but to our shame we haven't made real progress.</li>
  <li>Flourishing. A flourishing society requires flourishing individuals, families, and communities - in other words, prioritizing the general welfare, not demagogues, oligarchs, and special interests.</li>
  <li>Moderation. Aristotle said that law is reason codified, and that those who rule must be servants and protectors of the laws. This requires not only the ability to reason well about the common good, but a dedication to being reasonable.</li>
  <li>Effective governance. Our system of government has become ineffective at all levels, but especially at the federal level. Governments are trying to do too many things - and doing a poor job on most of them. We could use a lot more of Adam Smith's "peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice".</li>
  <li>Federalism and localism. To be effective, governance should happen much closer to the people. All functions except those explicitly ceded to the federal government in the Constitution should be performed by states, cities, towns, counties, neighborhoods, and voluntary associations of all kinds.</li>
  <li>Pluralism. From the very beginning, America has contained many different regions, ethnicities, religions, ideologies, and cultures. Like a jazz big band, these different "sections" come together to make beautiful but sometimes cacophonous music. Let's cherish and nurture it.</li>
  <li>Brotherhood. We Americans are all in this together; despite our differences, we should have a common regard for each other and a common commitment to the never-ending mission of realizing our American ideals in practice.</li>
  <li>A free world. It's a legacy of our revolution that America has always been a beacon of freedom; we should live up to that promise by working with our friends and allies around the globe and by welcoming law-abiding, freedom-loving people from all over the world to join the American project.</li>
</ol>
<p>At least that's how I see things now...</p>

<h2><a href="1949.html">Talking vs. Thinking</a></h2>
<h3>2025-04-07</h3>
<p>A friend and I have begun a pair reading of <cite>The Faith of a Heretic</cite> by Walter Kaufmann. It's the second time through for both of us and we have mutual admiration for Kaufmann, so we're excited about digging into this most personal of Kaufmann's books on philosophy and religion.</p>
<p>Here in the early going, I was struck by this paragraph in a section on intellectual honesty:</p>
<blockquote>Perhaps the single best example of the common lack of high standards in questions of honesty is our tendency to think in labels. Terms like existentialism, pragmatism, and empiricism, liberalism and conservatism are, more often than not, so many excuses for not considering individual ideas on their merits and for not exposing oneself to the bite of thought. For less educated people, words like Jew and Catholic, Democrat, Republican, and Communist do much the same job. These labels have some uses that are perfectly legitimate, but frequently they function as an aid to thoughtlessness and permit people to appear to <em>think</em> when they are merely talking.</blockquote>
<p>There's an awful lot of "merely talking" in the world, isn't there? In my life I've been just as guilty as the next person, but I've been striving to leave labels, isms, epithets, and slogans behind me. It's surprisingly hard work!</p>
<p>One of my methods is what I call encountering - deeply reading and considering the complete works of particular thinkers from the past. A good example is Thoreau. Having read everything he wrote, I have to wonder: Was Thoreau a transcendentalist? What does the label even mean? Could it be that, despite some similarities (what Wittgenstein might call "family resemblances"), lumping Thoreau in together with Kant, Fichte, Schelling, Swedenborg, Böhme, Carlyle, Coleridge, and the like actually lessens our understanding of Thoreau's individuality and multifarious insights?</p>
<p>Although encountering in my sense is a number of steps beyond steelmanning, unfortunately it takes extreme discipline and dedication - one might have time for only half a dozen encounters in life. I'm hopeful that Kaufmann's example and suggestions might help me discover thinking practices that aren't quite so intensive.</p>

<h2><a href="1948.html">Aristotle on Freedom</a></h2>
<h3>2025-03-31</h3>
<p>As mentioned two weeks ago in my note "Translation as Thinking", the concepts used across time and space (and, even, across writers) can vary quite significantly in the meanings they capture. This is especially true regarding concepts that are rather vague in the first place, such as virtue, happiness, democracy, and - the subject of today's post - freedom.</p>
<p>Although I'm far from the first to observe that the ancients thought differently about liberty and freedom than we moderns do - Benjamin Constant gave a famous talk on the topic over two hundred years ago - recently I've been struck by how foreign to us the classical Greek conceptions really are. While translating Aristotle's short "handout" <cite>On Thrivings and Failings of Character</cite>, I struggled to render the Greek word ἐλευθεριότης; the sense is wider than the usual Englishing of "generosity", whereas "liberality" sounds somewhat old-fashioned. So I looked up "liberal" in my 1828 edition of Webster's dictionary and struck paydirt on the first definition: "free of heart". That captures it perfectly, because ἐλευθεριότης is derived from the Greek word for freedom: ἐλευθερία.</p>
<p>Yet what did those old Greeks mean by freedom and free-heartedness? They definitely did not mean complete license to do whatever one pleases, for which they had a different word: ἐξουσία. Indeed, in Book XII of the <cite>Metaphysics</cite> Aristotle makes a passing remark that the freeborn members of an ancient Greek household were least at liberty to act as chance may have it, since their actions had to be well-ordered toward the common goals and common good of household management (οἰκονομία - whence our word "economics").</p>
<p>This idea that "something one and common is the work of all" figures prominently when Aristotle talks about social animals like bees, ants, and humans (the quote is from the <cite>Historia Animalium</cite>). In the historical context of classical Greece, where warfare between city-states was endemic, the primary common goal was simple survival and independence, because being conquered by another polis meant death or enslavement for the citizens. This is a core meaning of the word freedom in English, too: to be free means that you and your friends and frithmates are not in thrall to some other group but can control your group's destiny.</p>
<p>Yet Aristotle argues that mere survival is not the highest goal: we want not merely to live, but to live <em>well</em>. Because war is for the sake of peace and work is for the sake of leisure, military and productive activities are secondary to more glorious pursuits like wisdom, learning, conversation, music, dancing, poetry, art, religious festivals, athletic games, and all the other pastimes we humans have created to celebrate life.</p>
<p>This is why, according to Aristotle, free-hearted people are not only generous in our modern sense of charity (derived in large measure from Christian ethics), but also spend lavishly on necessities, delight in beauty, liberally express their love for family and friends and fellow citizens, and achieve quialities like adaptability, kindness, compassion, goodwill, and mutual understanding.</p>
<p>Thus we can see that for Aristotle and the ancient Greeks more generally, freedom meant being a well-ordered person whose internal harmony shone outward into harmonious relations with other people and the world at large. These insights explain a perhaps otherwise cryptic remark in <cite>On Thrivings and Failings of Character</cite>: "a person in seriously excellent condition is a model for a well-governed society." But perhaps not so cryptic after all, because a similar premise lies at the base of Plato's <cite>Republic</cite> and the entire Socratic tradition of classical philosophy.</p>
<p>At root, I would say, Aristotelian freedom is the capacity - perhaps even the capaciousness of mind and heart - to consistently act for the sake of what is beautiful in life. Although we hear an echo of this noble vision in Jefferson's "pursuit of happiness" (properly understood), it seems to me that we frivolous denizens of the twenty-first century no longer understand the depth, seriousness, and greatness that true freedom once implied, both personally and societally. The loss is ours.</p>
