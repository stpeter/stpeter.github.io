<h2><a href="1690.html">Cultivating Empathy</a></h2>
<h3>2022-01-01</h3>
<p>If you ask those I work with or mentor what my distinctive personal qualities are, I suspect that on the short list you might find empathy. For instance, I often reach out to work colleagues if I know that they face significant challenges, if their skills aren't being fully utilized, if they're not appreciated as much as they should be, if someone on their team has resigned, or on the positive side if they've been doing great work.</p>
<p>It might surprise such people to learn that I am not a naturally empathetic person. Another of my distinctive qualities is a sense of perspective, which in my case is connected with an attitude of distance or detachment. As I've worked more closely with people over the last ten years of my career, I've had to push myself to reach out, to listen, to empathize. By counteracting one of my natural tendencies, I've turned empathy into something approaching the "second nature" of an excellence of character.</p>
<p>As Aristotle says in Book Two of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>We must consider the things towards which we ourselves also are easily carried away; for some of us tend to one thing, some to another; and this will be recognizable from the pleasure and the pain we feel. We must drag ourselves away to the contrary extreme; for we shall get into the intermediate state by drawing well away from error, as people do in straightening sticks that are bent.</blockquote>
<p>Although I don't want to over-simplify what's involved in cultivating empathy or other character strengths, in my experience much of it is simply stopping to think about other people. "She's been working so hard on this project, I wonder how she's holding up?" "So-and-so just resigned, I should see how his teammates are doing." "I've really been impressed by how she's handled interactions with this client, I think I'll let her manager know." And so on. Such questions naturally lead to being curious about others, to caring about them, and to reaching out to them. By building up a practice of such thoughts and actions, I've become much more empathetic over time.</p>
<p>In future posts I'll explore in greater depth the topic of cultivating various virtues, with insights from thinkers as varied as Aristotle, Confucius, Ben Franklin, and positive psychologists like Martin Seligman and Chris Peterson.</p>

<h2><a href="1689.html">Monadnock Valley Press Annual Report 2021</a></h2>
<h3>2022-01-01</h3>
<p>Happy Public Domain Day!</p>
<p>Over at monadnock.net (my site for public-domain writings), in 2021 I republished works by Joseph Addison, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Homer, Langston Hughes, Henrik Ibsen, William James, Lucian, Alexander Pope, Edwin Arlington Robinson, Voltaire, and Virginia Woolf. Inspired in part by a conversation with Gytis Daujotas of Library Athena, I also optimized quite a few longer works for online reading by breaking them into smaller chunks (typically one web page per chapter for novels, per poem for poetry collections, per act for plays, and per section or chapter for nonfiction works).</p>
<p>For 2022 and beyond I've greatly expanded the publication roadmap to include, among other things, many more novels. In the early years I shied away from publishing novels because their length makes them hard to read online, but now that I've started "chunking" large works I feel that novels are fair game. Thus you'll see novels by the likes of Jane Austen, George Eliot, and Victor Hugo on the list of works that I plan to republish in future years.</p>

<h2><a href="1688.html">Questions and Answers</a></h2>
<h3>2021-12-29</h3>
<p>Consider the following statements... "There are no answers, only questions." "Life is all about the journey, not the destination." "A teacher or a counselor should encourage dialogue, not provide direction." All true as far as they go. And yet.</p>
<p>Life is finite. There is no escaping the necessity for answers and destinations and directions, even if in some sense they are never final but only provisional. If you ask the love of your life for an answer to the question "Will you marry me?" then presumably you don't want to hear that there are no answers, only questions! Any journey worthy of the name consists of a series of interim destinations, not completely random wanderings. Dialogue is delightful, but at its most constructive it results in realizations - often inspired by directions that a person or a book suggests - enabling you to make decisions about your future.</p>
<p>Here as always there is a balance to be struck.</p>
<p>On the one hand, if you're merely handed the answers or informed of your destination or told what direction to go in, then you're not truly learning or building the skills you must acquire in order to live well. On the other hand, a genuinely wise person knows that some answers and destinations and directions are better than others, and strives to help others avoid the brambles and stay on a path to flourishing and fulfillment.</p>
<p>And here as always it's finding the beautifully right balance that is the greatest challenge. As Spinoza says at the very end of his <cite>Ethics</cite>, "all things excellent are as difficult as they are rare."</p>

<h2><a href="1686.html">Weekly Wisdom</a></h2>
<h3>2021-12-27</h3>
<p>Although I don't make New Year's resolutions, at this time of year I do tend to reconsider some of my goals and practices. One thing I'd like to improve on is the frequency of entries in my online journal, because writing them pushes me to think about how I'm living and what I'm learning. Thus going forward I'll strive to post such reflections at least once a week - most likely on Friday evenings or over the weekend, when it's easier to find time for reflection.

<h2><a href="1685.html">Meditations on Bach #9: Musical Monadology</a></h2>
<h3>2021-12-26</h3>
<p>In meditation #7 of this series, I took note of some similarities between the aesthetics of Aristotle and the music of Bach. Another intriguing influence might be the monadology of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716), who directly influenced philosophers and musical theorists in the Bach's orbit: for instance, Bach's student Lorenz Mizler (1711-1778) was a follower of the Leibniz scholar Christian Wolff (1679-1754). In chapter 5 of his book <cite>Music in the Culture of the Renassiance and Other Essays</cite>, Edward Lowinsky makes the following observations:</p>
<blockquote>The surging melody conceals the motivic form of the substructure. This motivic form is one of the essential aspects of Bach's musical organism. The prototype of Bach's music, the fugue, reveals the relationship between the part and whole, the fugal subject and the fugal form.... [E]ven in the free form of the prelude, the closest relationship exists between the smallest part and the whole.... But we might be closest to the truth if we say that the whole and the parts, including the smallest elements, the motives, are inseparable and are in constant musical influence upon each other. Bach's music may be viewed as a perfect symbol of the universe as seen by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, a universe formed by Monads, which are defined as simple, individuated, energetic substances in a constant flx of activity and change, related to other Monads through a preestablished harmony. In this picture of the universe the Monad stands for the motive, the preestablished harmony for the vision of the whole. A Bach motive can indeed be defined in terms of a Leibniz Monad, whose main attribute is force and energy; it is constantly active and variable, but in the nature of its action and change it follows its own inner principle; the Monad is a mirror of the whole, even as the whole consists of the Monads. Yet, each Monad mirrors the whole, the universe, in its own individual fashion, so that the immense order and harmony of the universe is accompanied by infinite variety. In a Bach fugue we find the most perfect order together with the greatest possible variety. The fugal subject is as once identical throughout and variable throughout. It appears in constantly varying pitches, keys, shapes, time forms, and directions. Yet, it never loses its identity.</blockquote>
<p>This notion of unity in variety is what Bach and his followers called musical perfection. It is well summarized by John Butt in his paper "'A mind unconscious that it is calculating?' Bach and the rationalist philosophy of Wolff, Leibniz, and Spinoza", published in <cite>The Cambridge Companion to Bach</cite>, p. 64:</p>
<blockquote>The formula he [Leibniz] offers in the <cite>Monadology</cite> (1714) for God's creative strategy may well work as an ideal summary of Bach's approach to composition: "[the differing] perspectives of a single universe in accordance with the different points of view of each monad ... is the means of obtaining as much variety as possible; that is to say, it is the means of obtaining as much perfection as possible" (<cite>Monadology</cite>, paragraphs 57-8).</blockquote>
<p>As far as I can see (or hear!) this is not idle speculation, since it plays out in every measure of Bach's music.  Laurence Dreyfus plumbs the depths of these matters, albeit at a purely musical level (leaving aside all philosophical speculation), in his book <cite>Bach and the Patterns of Invention</cite>. In future meditations I'll have more to say about those patterns of invention specifically within the Bach Cello Suites.</p>
<p>P.S. It might not be accidental that this is post #1685 in my online journal, since Bach was born in the year 1685...</p>
