<h2><a href="1846.html">Truth, Goodness, Beauty</a></h2>
<h3>2024-01-13</h3>
<p>As I've noted before, the unity of truth, good, and beauty is close to the heart of the Socratic-Platonic-Aristotelian tradition. That's because the highest thing we can know or understand is not the world or even ourselves, but the good. Socrates realized this when he turned away from natural philosophy to the consideration of human affairs. For Aristotle, an understanding of the human good is the key to avoiding the extremes of foolishness and cunning, and thus achieving wisdom or φρόνησις; and an understanding of the divine (the good in its purest form) is the key to avoiding the extremes of ignorance and sophistry or deception, and thus achieving sagacity or σοφία.</p>
<p>This implies that epistemology is inherently ethical - that you need to be good in order to correctly and fully understand why things are the way they are. Indeed, it seems to me that all of the virtues apply not only to action but also to inquiry (for inquiry too is a form of activity). Thus in order to come at all close to wisdom or sagacity, you must have the intellectual courage to pursue truth wherever it may lead, the intellectual moderation or temperance to steer clear of partisanship, the intellectual generosity to give freely of your own insights, the intellectual mildness or gentleness to not get angry in the face of disagreement, the intellectual honesty to admit or even ferret out when and why you are wrong, the intellectual benevolence to care about other people's thoughts and conclusions, the intellectual compassion to see the world from other people's perspectives, the intellectual dignity to not manipulate people into agreeing with you, the intellectual justice or fairness to accurately represent other points of view, and so on. Thus truth and goodness are tightly intertwined.</p>
<p>What of goodness and beauty? For Aristotle, excellence of character had to be founded in a steadfast commitment to what is beautifully right or καλός - a phenomenon that straddles the fence between the ethical and the aesthetic. The best, most beautiful actions and feelings have a rightness about them, they are proportional to the situation you find yourself in, they fit seamlessly together, they don't leave out anything important, they are well ordered, they bespeak a certain personal stature, and they are significant and meaningful to the people involved. These nominally aesthetic qualities are all in play when we say to someone, "That was a beautiful thing you did."</p>
<p>Although Plato and Aristotle didn't draw out all the implications of these connections in their writings, they might have done so in their philosophical communities (the Academy and Lyceum), which you likely couldn't have joined unless you were already a good person. And, following Socrates, they firmly held that the love of wisdom and the pursuit of truth were best done with people you care about and who care about you. Ultimately this means that truth and goodness and beauty are not merely abstract ideas but intimately and irreducibly personal. Thus what has seemed faraway all these millennia might be much nearer than we ever thought possible.</p>

<h2><a href="1845.html">Freed from Need</a></h2>
<h3>2024-01-02</h3>
<p>A few months ago, two different people reached out to me about editing their respective books. The first person was someone I had worked with for several years, whom I liked and respected, who had a complete manuscript that although in need of editing was in decent shape, and who was respectful of my time and fairly flexible about schedule. The second person was someone who contacted me out of the blue, who hadn't put in the effort to make his manuscript as good as he was able to on his own, who wanted a quick turnaround, and who was kind of passive-aggressive about working together; he seemed to think that offering to pay me would make up for these failings, and indeed he was almost offended when I told him that I don't charge to edit people's books.</p>
<p>What the second person didn't understand is that I don't have to take on projects like this: I do the work because I enjoy it, because I like the person I'll collaborate with, and because I see value in the book. If you offer to pay me as compensation for putting up with the guano you want to introduce into my life, I have a simple answer: I don't need it!</p>
<p>Interestingly, the ancient Greek conception of freedom (ἐλευθερία) centered not on freedom from government or from domination by others, but freedom from toil, strife, warfighting, and in general from the yoke of all-encompassing necessity. The ultimate freedom was to be <em>freed from need</em> and thus to be freed up for serious yet leisurely activities that celebrate life and are beautifully right, such as love and friendship, games and festivals, music, dramatic performances, artistic appreciation, intelligent conversation, scientific inquiry, and philosophical speculation. A worthy and delightful ideal, if you ask me.</p>

<h2><a href="1844.html">Monadnock Valley Press Annual Report 2023</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-28</h3>
<p>In contrast to 2022, when I republished works by fifty authors, 2023 was a slow year at the Monadnock Valley Press. In retrospect, the focus seems to have been English-language poets old and new (or as new as copyright expiration laws will allow). In chronological order of authors' birthdates, that would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/wyatt/">Sir Thomas Wyatt</a> (1503-1542)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/dyer/">Sir Edward Dyer</a> (1543-1607)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/alexander/">William Alexander</a> (1567-1640)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/wotton/">Sir Henry Wotton</a> (1568-1639)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/jonson/">Ben Jonson</a> (1572-1631)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/suckling/">Sir John Suckling</a> (1609-1641)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/dryden/">John Dryden</a> (1631-1700)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/cowper/">William Cowper</a> (1731-1800)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/lovell/">Robert Lovell</a> (1771-1796)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/southey/">Robert Southey</a> (1774-1843)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/byron/">Lord Byron</a> (1788-1824)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/keats/">John Keats</a> (1795-1821)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/sandburg/">Carl Sandburg</a> (1878-1967)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/benet/">Stephen Vincent Benét</a> (1898-1943)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/hughes/">Langston Hughes</a> (1901-1967)</li>
</ul>
<p>I also republished a few lesser-known books by <a href="https://monadnock.net/gibran/">Kahlil Gibran</a> (he's more of a prose poet than a poet, I suppose) as well as nine speeches by <a href="https://monadnock.net/lincoln/">Abraham Lincoln</a>. Plus I created pages listing all the works I've published in various genres (<a href="https://monadnock.net/poems.html">poems</a>, <a href="https://monadnock.net/essays.html">essays</a>, etc.) since I started on January 1st, 2008.</p>
<p>And that's all!</p>
<p>Because I had hoped to do much more, a large number of works originally on the roadmap for 2023 will need to be moved to future years. I suspect 2024 might not be much more productive, since I have many other projects underway, including my forthcoming book on Aristotle. Yet that's the beauty of a leisurely project like this: I do it for pleasure and work on it whenever I have the time and inclination.</p>

<h2><a href="1843.html">2023 Readings</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-27</h3>
<p>In a typical year I read about 80 books, but this year I made it through less than 60. Granted, several of them were big, such as Ron Chernow's biography of Washington and Victor Hugo's wondrous novel <cite>Les Misérables</cite>; but others were short and easy. The ones that made the greatest impression on me were <cite>Honeybee Democracy</cite> by Thomas Seeley, <cite>The Old Way</cite> by Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, <cite>Free to Learn</cite> by Peter Gray, <cite>Grief</cite> by Michael Cholbi, the aforementioned biography of Washington, and the <cite>Poetical Works</cite> of 17th-century English poet Thomas Traherne. (The linked titles below point to texts in the public domain available at my Monadnock site, and the blog posts at the bottom contain reflections on several of the books that impressed me most.)</p>
<p>My book goals for 2024 include re-reading the <cite>Iliad</cite> and the <cite>Odyssey</cite> (likely in Richard Lattimore's translation) and acquainting myself with more of Shakespeare's plays (since I've recently read both <cite>The Tempest</cite> and <cite>Two Gentlemen of Verona</cite>, perhaps I'll read the rest of the plays set in Italy). I might also tackle Jonathan Israel's massive new biography of Spinoza. But who knows? One of the delights of reading is not necessarily achieving your goals but instead following your varied interests wherever they may lead. As J.R.R. Tolkien wrote in <cite>The Fellowship of the Ring</cite> (another book I might re-read before long): not all those who wander are lost.</p>

<h2><a href="1842.html">The Old Way</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-23</h3>
<p>In her book <cite>The Old Way</cite>, Elizabeth Marshall Thomas provides a poignant portrait of the hunter-gatherer way of life, based on her "first contact" experience with the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert in the early 1950s. Her account contains many fascinating aspects, such as her description of how the Bushmen groups of ~25 people had no leader but instead made decisions by consensus. She calls their knowledge, customs, and skills "The Old Way" because she contends that we humans evolved into that way of life over hundreds of thousands (perhaps even millions) of years after we split from chimpanzees and the climate of much of Africa changed from rain forest to savannah. When you consider that humans lived as hunter-gatherers for over ten thousand generations, that we have lived as agriculturalists for only a few hundred generations, and that we have lived in industrial society for only ten to twenty generations, you start to realize the vast scale of human evolution and the deep foundations for how we think and behave - as well as the extraordinary novelty of our modern way of life. It's no surprise, then, that it's all too easy for us, whether individually or collectively, to retrogress into tribalism. Yet it seems to me that modern tribalism has all the worst features of The Old Way and none of the many features that redeemed it and indeed made it absolutely necessary for human survival until ten thousand years ago or so. In fact, what we think of as tribalism seems to have more in common with the hierarchical societies based on status, power, and wealth that emerged after the hunter-gatherer way of life broke down, and less on the egalitarian societies of The Old Way.</p>
<p>As Bob Marley once sang, "If you knew your history, then you would know where you're coming from."</p>

<h2><a href="1841.html">Short Shrift</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-19</h3>
<p>Riffing on a post by Arnold Kling, who in turn was riffing on Marc Andreessen, I've been pondering the topics that various schools of thought tend to ignore. Kling was talking about politics: conservatives don't like to discuss beneficial social changes they once opposed, progressives don't like to consider anything but oppression as a cause of disparate outcomes, etc. However, we can apply the same line of thinking to philosophies. Here are a few possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aristotelians give short shrift to moral rules and behavioral policies.</li>
<li>Kantians give short shrift to character traits and the outcomes of action.</li>
<li>Utilitarians give short shrift to personal relationships and character traits.</li>
<li>Stoics give short shrift to emotions and the irreplaceable value of loved ones.</li>
<li>Epicureans give short shrift to the socio-political environment in which one lives.</li>
<li>Confucians give short shrift to spontaneity and living in the moment.</li>
<li>Taoists give short shrift to deliberation and planning for the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on. It'd be a worthwhile exercise to think this through more fully.</p>
