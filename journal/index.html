<h2><a href="1844.html">Monadnock Valley Press Annual Report 2023</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-28</h3>
<p>In contrast to 2022, when I republished works by fifty authors, 2023 was a slow year at the Monadnock Valley Press. In retrospect, the focus seems to have been English-language poets old and new (or as new as copyright expiration laws will allow). In chronological order of authors' birthdates, that would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/wyatt/">Sir Thomas Wyatt</a> (1503-1542)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/dyer/">Sir Edward Dyer</a> (1543-1607)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/alexander/">William Alexander</a> (1567-1640)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/wotton/">Sir Henry Wotton</a> (1568-1639)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/jonson/">Ben Jonson</a> (1572-1631)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/suckling/">Sir John Suckling</a> (1609-1641)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/dryden/">John Dryden</a> (1631-1700)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/cowper/">William Cowper</a> (1731-1800)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/lovell/">Robert Lovell</a> (1771-1796)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/southey/">Robert Southey</a> (1774-1843)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/byron/">Lord Byron</a> (1788-1824)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/keats/">John Keats</a> (1795-1821)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/sandburg/">Carl Sandburg</a> (1878-1967)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/benet/">Stephen Vincent Benét</a> (1898-1943)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://monadnock.net/hughes/">Langston Hughes</a> (1901-1967)</li>
</ul>
<p>I also republished a few lesser-known books by <a href="https://monadnock.net/gibran/">Kahlil Gibran</a> (he's more of a prose poet than a poet, I suppose) as well as nine speeches by <a href="https://monadnock.net/lincoln/">Abraham Lincoln</a>. Plus I created pages listing all the works I've published in various genres (<a href="https://monadnock.net/poems.html">poems</a>, <a href="https://monadnock.net/essays.html">essays</a>, etc.) since I started on January 1st, 2008.</p>
<p>And that's all!</p>
<p>Because I had hoped to do much more, a large number of works originally on the roadmap for 2023 will need to be moved to future years. I suspect 2024 might not be much more productive, since I have many other projects underway, including my forthcoming book on Aristotle. Yet that's the beauty of a leisurely project like this: I do it for pleasure and work on it whenever I have the time and inclination.</p>

<h2><a href="1843.html">2023 Readings</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-27</h3>
<p>In a typical year I read about 80 books, but this year I made it through less than 60. Granted, several of them were big, such as Ron Chernow's biography of Washington and Victor Hugo's wondrous novel <cite>Les Misérables</cite>; but others were short and easy. The ones that made the greatest impression on me were <cite>Honeybee Democracy</cite> by Thomas Seeley, <cite>The Old Way</cite> by Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, <cite>Free to Learn</cite> by Peter Gray, <cite>Grief</cite> by Michael Cholbi, the aforementioned biography of Washington, and the <cite>Poetical Works</cite> of 17th-century English poet Thomas Traherne. (The linked titles below point to texts in the public domain available at my Monadnock site, and the blog posts at the bottom contain reflections on several of the books that impressed me most.)</p>
<p>My book goals for 2024 include re-reading the <cite>Iliad</cite> and the <cite>Odyssey</cite> (likely in Richard Lattimore's translation) and acquainting myself with more of Shakespeare's plays (since I've recently read both <cite>The Tempest</cite> and <cite>Two Gentlemen of Verona</cite>, perhaps I'll read the rest of the plays set in Italy). I might also tackle Jonathan Israel's massive new biography of Spinoza. But who knows? One of the delights of reading is not necessarily achieving your goals but instead following your varied interests wherever they may lead. As J.R.R. Tolkien wrote in <cite>The Fellowship of the Ring</cite> (another book I might re-read before long): not all those who wander are lost.</p>

<h2><a href="1842.html">The Old Way</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-23</h3>
<p>In her book <cite>The Old Way</cite>, Elizabeth Marshall Thomas provides a poignant portrait of the hunter-gatherer way of life, based on her "first contact" experience with the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert in the early 1950s. Her account contains many fascinating aspects, such as her description of how the Bushmen groups of ~25 people had no leader but instead made decisions by consensus. She calls their knowledge, customs, and skills "The Old Way" because she contends that we humans evolved into that way of life over hundreds of thousands (perhaps even millions) of years after we split from chimpanzees and the climate of much of Africa changed from rain forest to savannah. When you consider that humans lived as hunter-gatherers for over ten thousand generations, that we have lived as agriculturalists for only a few hundred generations, and that we have lived in industrial society for only ten to twenty generations, you start to realize the vast scale of human evolution and the deep foundations for how we think and behave - as well as the extraordinary novelty of our modern way of life. It's no surprise, then, that it's all too easy for us, whether individually or collectively, to retrogress into tribalism. Yet it seems to me that modern tribalism has all the worst features of The Old Way and none of the many features that redeemed it and indeed made it absolutely necessary for human survival until ten thousand years ago or so. In fact, what we think of as tribalism seems to have more in common with the hierarchical societies based on status, power, and wealth that emerged after the hunter-gatherer way of life broke down, and less on the egalitarian societies of The Old Way.</p>

<h2><a href="1841.html">Short Shrift</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-19</h3>
<p>Riffing on a post by Arnold Kling, who in turn was riffing on Marc Andreessen, I've been pondering the topics that various schools of thought tend to ignore. Kling was talking about politics: conservatives don't like to discuss beneficial social changes they once opposed, progressives don't like to consider anything but oppression as a cause of disparate outcomes, etc. However, we can apply the same line of thinking to philosophies. Here are a few possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aristotelians give short shrift to moral rules and behavioral policies.</li>
<li>Kantians give short shrift to character traits and the outcomes of action.</li>
<li>Utilitarians give short shrift to personal relationships and character traits.</li>
<li>Stoics give short shrift to emotions and the irreplaceable value of loved ones.</li>
<li>Epicureans give short shrift to the socio-political environment in which one lives.</li>
<li>Confucians give short shrift to spontaneity and living in the moment.</li>
<li>Taoists give short shrift to deliberation and planning for the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on. It'd be a worthwhile exercise to think this through more fully.</p>

<h2><a href="1840.html">Do We Need the Concept of a Concept?</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-18</h3>
<p>As mentioned last month, I'm slowly re-reading Robert Sokolowski's book <cite>Phenomenology of the Human Person</cite> with a friend of mine. When I first wrote about this book four years ago, I noted that Sokolowski "explains the epistemology of reason in the context of human conversation: by embracing the back and forth of speech ... he sidesteps the ever present dangers of solipsism and mental representationalism." As a point of comparison, in her book <cite>Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology</cite>, Ayn Rand says that a child independently formulates the concept of, say, a tree in his or her own mind by observing trees in reality. However, on this account we need to add communication as a separate capacity on top of concept-formation so that we can explain how the child associates the word 'tree' with the concept.</p>
<p>By contrast, Sokolowski says that we English-speakers simply use the word 'tree' to talk about the trees we encounter and the child naturally learns to use the word because that's what other English-speakers say. As a result, we don't need the concept of a concept, which is merely another kind of mental representation - and, according to Sokolowski, such representations don't exist. Thus philosophical parsimony might lead us to strike concepts from our talk about how we understand what we know. I see quite a bit of sense in what he says, so I've been trying the idea on for size.</p>
<p>Ironically, Sokolowski goes on say that words serve to focus the mind on reality, yet it seems to me this assumes that somehow there is a <em>thing</em> called the mind inside us - and I've previously noted that I have my doubts about that position.</p>
<p>Yes, reification is hard to avoid...</p>

<h2><a href="1839.html">Philosophy vs. Philosophies</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-14</h3>
<p>On the very first page of his book <cite>What Is Ancient Philosophy?</cite>, Pierre Hadot — the late French scholar who almost singlehandedly resurrected the humanistic conception of philosophy as a way of life — drew a distinction between individual philosophies on the one hand and philosophy itself on the other:</p>
<blockquote>
Seldom do we reflect upon what philosophy is in itself. Indeed, it is extremely difficult to define it. What philosophy students are introduced to is above all <em>philosophies</em>.... In itself, there is nothing wrong with all this. It certainly seems that the way one can come to have an idea of <em>philosophy</em> is by studying <em>philosophies</em>. Yet the history of "philosophy" is not the same as the history of philosophies, if what we understand by "philosophies" are theoretical discourses and philosophers' systems. In addition to this history, however, there is room for the study of philosophical modes of life.
</blockquote>
<p>Here is one way to think about it: loving and practicing wisdom is not the same thing as adhering to a worldview. The aim of wisdom is self-mastery and self-knowledge, i.e., both serious self-examination as a central, organizing activity of your life and the development of deep "mindedness", intentionality, understanding, and insight as abiding traits of your thinking and character. By contrast, if you consider yourself to be primarily an adherent of a worldview, then your allegiance to the love and practice of wisdom is only secondary, and can be successful only to the extent that the worldview to which adhere truly values wisdom. Not all of them do: consider, for example, the very idea of utilitarianism as a way of life; as a rule-based ethical system, it doesn't really value wisdom and character as first-class concerns (of which, to my mind, the failures of Effective Altruism are merely the most recent manifestation).</p>
<p>It seems to me that the aspiration to be a philosopher is rooted in an existential commitment to live an examined life and to pursue truth wherever it may lead. By contrast, the aspiration to be, say, a loyal and consistent Stoic or Buddhist is rooted intellectually in accepting that worldview as final truth and emotionally in feeling the comfort of feeling that fundamentally your search for truth is over. To put it metaphorically: while the adherent sighs contentedly as he settles into his comfortable home, the explorer shoulders his pack to track the trail of truth over the next mountain range.</p>
<p>That said, I do think that a person can become wise within the narrower scope of a well-defined worldview; however, it might require more time and even some cognitive dissonance as the adherent tries to bend that worldview to deal with the messy realities of life. This might be easier in long-lived traditions like Confucianism and Christianity that contain competing strands of thought (e.g., the Augustinian and Thomistic strands of Christianity), since that enables the adherent to pick and choose different emphases to suit the demands of particular situations.</p>
