<h2><a href="1787.html">Keeping It Brief</a></h2>
<h3>2022-06-09</h3>
<p>Epicurus once said: "Understand that a long discourse and a short one both achieve the same result." Although that's standard advice for writers (Yevgeny Zamyatin counselled "writing with 90-proof ink"), few follow it. Many books could have been long articles, many long articles could have been blog posts, and many blog posts could have been aphorisms. My journal entries average around 400 words these days, and I limit my books to around 100 pages. This is simple respect for you, the reader. Besides, I'd rather provoke difficult questions than provide definitive answers, because only you can answer those questions for yourself, anyway. Perhaps loving wisdom involves respecting <em>your</em> wisdom as much as my own...</p>

<h2><a href="1786.html">Socrates and Thoreau Revisited</a></h2>
<h3>2022-06-09</h3>
<p>Last year around this time I posted a few thoughts on Socrates and Thoreau, specifically regarding the likely influence of a passage in Book VI of Plato's <cite>Republic</cite> on Thoreau's attitude toward mere professors of philosophy, who unlike true philosophers do not live according to the dictates of wisdom. The other day, while re-reading key passages in Plato's dialogues as part of my research on Aristotle, I suddenly realized that on the very next page in the 1804 edition of Plato's works that Thoreau borrowed from Emerson can be found the inspiration for Thoreau's attitude toward the news, best encapsulated in an aphorism from his essay <cite>Life Without Principle</cite>: "Read not the Times. Read the Eternities."</p>
<p>Here is the relevant passage from the <cite>Republic</cite>, in the translation that Thoreau would have read (Sydenham and Taylor 1804, p. 337):</p>
<blockquote>For somehow, Adimantus, the man at least who really applies his dianoÃ«tic part to true being, has not leisure to look down to the little affairs of mankind, and, in fighting with them, to be filled with envy and ill nature; but, beholding and contemplating such objects as are orderly, and always subsist in the same manner, such as neither injure not are injured by each other, but are in all respects beautiful, and according to reason, these he imitates and resembles as far as possible; or, do you think it possible by any contrivance that a man not imitate that, in conversing with which he is filled with admiration?</blockquote>
<p>We can find significant echoes of these thoughts in <cite>Life Without Principle</cite>, such as:</p>
<blockquote>Not without a slight shudder at the danger, I often perceive how near I had come to admitting into my mind the details of some trivial affair -- the news of the street; and I am astonished to observe how willing men are to lumber their minds with such rubbish -- to permit idle rumors and incidents of the most insignificant kind to intrude on ground which should be sacred to thought. Shall the mind be a public arena, where the affairs of the street and the gossip of the tea-table chiefly are discussed? Or shall it be a quarter of heaven itself -- an hypaethral temple, consecrated to the service of the gods? I find it so difficult to dispose of the few facts which to me are significant, that I hesitate to burden my attention with those which are insignificant, which only a divine mind could illustrate. Such is, for the most part, the news in newspapers and conversation. It is important to preserve the mind's chastity in this respect.</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>If we have thus desecrated ourselves -- as who has not? -- the remedy will be by wariness and devotion to reconsecrate ourselves, and make once more a fane of the mind. We should treat our minds, that is, ourselves, as innocent and ingenuous children, whose guardians we are, and be careful what objects and what subjects we thrust on their attention. Read not the Times. Read the Eternities. Conventionalities are at length as bad as impurities. Even the facts of science may dust the mind by their dryness, unless they are in a sense effaced each morning, or rather rendered fertile by the dews of fresh and living truth. Knowledge does not come to us by details, but in flashes of light from heaven.</blockquote>
<p>Thus Thoreau, as Socrates two millennia before him, had a deeper purpose for avoiding trivialities: to model himself on the highest principles of what is sacred and beautiful and divine in human existence.</p>

<h2><a href="1785.html">George Winston, RIP</a></h2>
<h3>2023-06-07</h3>
<p>I was saddened yesterday to learn (via my friend Wayne Bethanis) that pianist-composer George Winston has died. Every solo performer of original music - not just pianists but guitarists and everyone else - owes him a debt of gratitude, for he was one of the few who blazed the trail of modern instrumental music, starting with his album <cite>Autumn</cite> in 1980. Although his music was often called "new age", he preferred the evocative term "rural folk piano". Many streams came together in his music: folk, blues, jazz, classical, rock, gospel, rhythm and blues, Hawaiian, and more. Yet he fused them into a seamless whole that was uniquely his own.</p>
<p>George Winston truly lived music as a way of life. Long ago I saw him perform at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City; in his flannel shirt and woolen socks, he was not dressed like a typical performer, but his utmost dedication to the music was evident from the first note to the last.</p>
<p>In my youth, I spent many, many hours listening to his albums <cite>Autumn</cite>, <cite>Winter Into Spring</cite>, and <cite>December</cite>, which were a significant influence on my own attempts at composing music for solo guitar; if I ever get around to recording these pieces, it will be in part to pay homage to the incomparable artistry of George Winston.</p>

<h2><a href="1784.html">Aristotle on Fulfillment</a></h2>
<h3>2023-06-01</h3>
<p>The more deeply I ponder Aristotle's conception of eudaimonia (usually translated as "happiness" or more recently sometimes as "flourishing"), the more radical it seems.</p>
<p>For instance, we are perfectly comfortable saying things like "that basil plant is much happier since we moved it to the windowsill" or "their daughter is really flourishing in her new school"; by contrast, Aristotle refused to attribute eudaimonia to plants or animals or even to children.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, it's complicated, but to simplify matters somewhat I'll say that it's bound up with his views on actualizing potential (or activating capacities) and what it means to achieve fulfillment, since he sees important differences here between humans and non-human animals, and between mature and immature humans.</p>
<p>The first level of fulfillment for a living being consists of the natural capacities to engage in the activities that comprise the way of life for beings of that kind (e.g., the power of sight, which is made possible by having eyes). The second level of fulfillment consists of activating and exercising those capacities (e.g., actually using the eyes to see). In his works on zoology, Aristotle calls the biological affordances for action (e.g., eyes or hands) organs, and in Greek organ means tool; thus the second level of fulfillment consists in a being's using its natural tools for living.</p>
<p>Life is more sophisticated for human beings because we have what Aristotle calls a kind of second nature: our character. It's true that further levels of fulfillment are open to human beings because we possess further powers such as reason, speech, imagination, culture, social learning, forethought, planning, goals, purposes, and deliberation. But those powers are volitional: human fulfillment is a matter of choice, commitment, and deliberate self-development.</p>
<p>Here again Aristotle focuses on two varieties of fulfillment: capacities and their activation. Thus the third level of fulfillment consists of the acquired dispositions that comprise the virtues of thought and character, and the fourth level consists of the active application of those virtues to the practices of living well, i.e., reliably choosing to act and feel in ways that are beautifully right in the many and various situations that one faces in life. It is this fourth level of fulfillment that Aristotle refers to as eudaimonia: not merely living, but living well.</p>
<p>Although a non-human animal can objectively flourish and experience some of the simpler pleasures of existence, according to Aristotle it does not achieve the highest level of fulfillment because its psyche is not suffused with (to put it briefly) thought and purpose and meaning. Similarly, although a child is on the way to being capable of the highest level of fulfillment, completely activating that capacity takes many years of learning, practice, reflection, and the kinds of choices and commitments that build up the mature self as the achievement of a lifetime.</p>
<p>Even this condensed summary indicates that the biological and anthropological foundations of Aristotle's conception of eudaimonia establish a meaning that goes far deeper than our superficial notion of happiness as positive feeling, subjective well-being, or utilitarian pleasure. We moderns think we know it all, but old Aristotle still has a great deal to teach us about human fulfillment.</p>

<h2><a href="1783.html">Ways of Life and Lines of Work</a></h2>
<h3>2023-06-01</h3>
<p>Because labor is so central to human existence, throughout history various thinkers have speculated about what the Buddhist eightfold path calls "right livelihood" for those who would seek and practice wisdom. For instance, both the Stoic Musonius Rufus and the Confucian Wu Yubi advocated subsistence farming as a noble line of work. The Taoist sage Chuang Tzu tells a beautiful story about the artistry of a lowly butcher. Although officially Aristotle downplayed the value of mechanical pursuits like housebuilding and even music-making, nevertheless he frequently used craftsmen as models of practical thinking and he applied the lessons of craftsmanship to ethical reflection. In recent times, Matthew Crawford titled one of his books "shop class as soul craft" and has argued that working in the trades enables you to bring your whole self to your productive activities. And so on.</p>
<p>It's been said that there is something especially fulfilling or even honest about working with your hands. At one level that makes sense, because so much about a human way of life depends on our hands (we are tool-makers who manage and manipulate things, and we even speak of grasping ideas). Yet other aspects of human existence are nearly as fundamental, such as our social interactions and our conceptual-linguistic abilities; although some folks prefer working with things, others prefer working with people or with symbols.</p>
<p>Moreover, recent research in the social sciences (e.g., by Amy Wrzesniewski and colleagues) indicates that three attitudes toward work are nearly ubiquitous: seeing work as a job, as a career, or as a calling. And within the latter, Michael Pratt et al. have identified three distinct orientations (which are not mutually exclusive):</p>
<ol>
<li>A craftsmanship orientation that is focused on doing the work well for its own sake. Workers with a craftsmanship orientation typically care most about gaining expertise, often emphasize the aesthetic aspects of the work product, and might have a goal of becoming a master practitioner.</li>
<li>A serving orientation that is focused on doing good for the sake of other people. Workers with a serving orientation typically care most about the beneficiaries of their work and derive satisfaction from helping people.</li>
<li>A team orientation that is focused on doing the work with one's teammates. Workers with a kinship orientation typically find value in opportunities for building close, family-like bonds with their colleagues.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus it strikes me that just about every line of work can afford opportunities for learning, reflection, self-improvement, and fulfillment. It's more a question of how you approach the work than what the work is in itself.</p>

<h2><a href="1782.html">Ways of Life</a></h2>
<h3>2023-05-17</h3>
<p>Having last week explored what philosophers do, I thought I'd broaden that theme by looking at ways of life in general, not only philosophy as a way of life.</p>
<p>Although Aristotle delineated four ways of life (making money, having fun, public service, and intellectual inquiry), nowadays we often think of various hobbies and pursuits as something approaching a way of life. Often these are bound up with one's profession or career (the unfortunately ubiquitous question "what do you do?"), but just as often they are associated with some other focal activity that is a relatively core part of your identity: runner, foodie, crafter, or what have you.</p>
<p>This kind of lifeway can have a significant effect on how you spend your time and structure your day, what you think about and pay attention to, your habits of mind and emotion, how you react to events, the relationships you cultivate, and so on. For instance, a runner traveling to another city might pack her running gear, plan runs while staying there, perhaps meet up with a local running partner or group, etc. By contrast, a foodie traveling to the same location might check out intriguing restaurants, fresh food markets, cooking classes, and the like.</p>
<p>Because there are only so many hours in the day, there are limits to how many ways of life you can pursue in a serious manner at any one stage of life - I'd say less than five and perhaps only two or three. During my 25-year career in the tech industry, I found that I had time and attention primarily for my work and secondarily for some philosophical research and writing, but not also for musical projects.</p>
<p>Yet even that might have been stretching it. Consider a person who is not only passionate about a particular pursuit, but who borders on obsessive (although perhaps in a good way). To take a well-known example, consider J.S. Bach: he was constantly immersed in music, whether playing, teaching, composing, organizing concerts, consulting with musical instrument makers, and so on. Even his close friends, his extended family members, and his two wives (first Maria Barbara and then Anna Magdelena) were musicians! Music was such a thoroughgoing way of life for him that it truly <em>was</em> his life.</p>
<p>Is that level of lifelong commitment necessary to find fulfillment? For some people it is (indeed, in the <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite> Aristotle claimed that it is the height of folly not to have a single, overarching purpose in life). Yet others are just as happy structuring their lives into a few distinct stages (Ã  la the Hindu ashramas) or going with the flow of life in an even looser fashion and following new interests as they arise. It seems to me that deciding which of these approaches makes sense for you is a large part of what it means to know thyself, as the ancient Greeks counseled.</p>
