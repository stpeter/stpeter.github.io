<h2><a href="1770.html">Counter-Cultural Contemplation</a></h2>
<h3>2023-03-02</h3>
<p>We live in a culture that glorifies action, busy-ness, and constant activity. "Don't just stand there, do something." "Idle hands are the devil's workshop." "Pull your head out of the clouds." "Get real." "Think globally, act locally." "Knowledge is power."</p>
<p>This attitude has even bled into philosophy, that most abstract of humanistic disciplines. It was Francis Bacon (1561-1626) who first insisted that knowledge is power. Philosophy as political activism is a more recent invention; we can perhaps date it to 1845, the year in which Karl Marx proclaimed that "Philosophers have hitherto only <em>interpreted</em> the world in various ways; the point is to <em>change</em> it." Yet Marx, who wrote his doctoral dissertation on the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, should have known better. As Pierre Hadot has explained, in ancient times the purpose of philosophy as a way of life was never merely to interpret the world, and certainly not primarily to change it, but to <em>change oneself</em>.</p>
<p>"Be the change you want to see." That sounds like another form of activism, doesn't it? But what if the change you pursue is to withdraw from the hustle-bustle of activism in all its forms and instead to use your leisure time for the serious purpose of inquiry, awareness, and deep understanding of the causes of things?</p>
<p>In the context of 21st century society, could the <em>vita contemplativa</em> be the ultimate counter-culture and perhaps even a threat to those in authority, since it fundamentally repudiates the avaricious acquisition of power, wealth, status, and fame?</p>
<p>Something to ponder...</p>

<h2><a href="1769.html">Aristotle on States of Character</a></h2>
<h3>2023-02-23</h3>
<p>One of the distinctive features of Aristotle's philosophy of human affairs is his analysis of the various states of character, of which he identifies at least four: the corrupted person, the unrestrained person, the self-restrained person, and the good person. I might describe them briefly as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The thoroughly corrupted person (i.e., the μοχθηρός) has no knowledge of the beautifully right and fully human way to live, and therefore consistently indulges in ignoble actions and feelings according to momentary desires. Therefore this person lacks knowledge and doesn't act or feel aright in many or most circumstances.</li>
<li>The unrestrained person (i.e., the ἀκρατής) has knowledge of the beautifully right and fully human way to live, but that knowledge can be overruled by momentary desires to indulge in ignoble actions and feelings. Therefore this person has knowledge but doesn't always act and feel aright in certain circumstances, and thus doesn't experience inner harmony.</li>
<li>The self-restrained person (i.e., the ἐγκρατής) has knowledge of the beautifully right and fully human way to live, and uses that knowledge to override momentary desires to indulge in ignoble actions and feelings. Therefore this person has knowledge and acts aright in the end but doesn't always feel aright, and thus doesn't always experience inner harmony.</li>
<li>The thoroughly excellent person who takes life seriously (i.e., the σπουδαῖος) has knowledge of the beautifully right and fully human way to live, and also has a settled desire to consistently apply that knowledge in actions and feelings. Therefore this person has knowledge, acts aright, feels aright, and experiences inner harmony.</li>
</ol>
<p>Two points here are potentially confusing.</p>
<p>First, these states are not all or nothing. We're all familiar with people who might be unrestrained in one respect (say, they have a gambling problem) but who behave in acceptable ways in other aspects or domains of life. Although Aristotle mentions this nuance a few times, he doesn't talk about it in great detail (perhaps because he's interested in understanding the nature of the character states, not in judging individual people).</p>
<p>Second, when we describe these states of character in terms of knowledge and desire, we might infer that there is an inherent conflict between reason and emotion. However, that's not accurate, for two reasons: knowledge too involves yearning (for "all human beings yearn to know") and a wholehearted commitment to the beautifully right and fully human way to live is a seamless combination of yearning and thinking (for "commitment is either desiderative deliberation or deliberative desire").</p>
<p>Finally, what about this concept of "the beautifully right and fully human way to live"? Isn't that antithetical to pluralism about values? Well, maybe, but that's a large topic for a future post or my forthcoming book on Aristotle...</p>

<h3>2023-02-18</h3>
<p>As a brief addendum to my post about digital moderation, I'll mention another longtime habit of mine: analog wayfinding. I have never used automated navigation systems like GPS; instead, if I'm going someplace new I look at a map beforehand and commit the route to memory. (For example, last year I drove from Camden, Maine to Ottawa, Canada in this way.) It helps that my spatial memory is strong: I seem to keep a schematic picture of the route in my head so that I can essentially walk through the whole thing and recall the necessary decision points when I come to an intersection. In addition, I have a general idea of my interim destinations (e.g., towns I need to pass through or roads I need to drive on), so if I go off course I have an intuitive sense of how to correct the situation. Yes, occasionally I get slightly lost, but I always pretty much know where I am. Give it a try sometime! :-)</p>

<h2><a href="1767.html">Of Cigarettes and Smartphones</a></h2>
<h3>2023-02-16</h3>
<p>Have you ever watched an old movie from perhaps 75 years ago in which it seems that everyone was smoking cigarettes? We - who are, of course, far wiser - shake our heads at their benighted behavior because we recognize the horrendous health effects of smoking.</p>
<p>But have you ever wondered what folks 75 years from today might look back on with similar feelings regarding the benighted behaviors we exhibit nowadays? Might they perhaps home in on our compulsive use of smartphones?</p>
<p>Having just read Cal Newport's book <cite>Digital Minimalism</cite>, these questions are top of mind for me. Over the years I have progressively cut back on smartphone usage: I've deleted social media apps (I quit Twitter in 2016 but removed their mobile app years before that), I've disabled sounds and badges and other notifications, I've switched my phone colors to greyscale to make the interface less stimulating, etc. And now that I've left the tech industry, I am blessedly free of constant meeting reminders, hundreds of email messages a day, and above all Slack. Yet still the stupid phone beckons: hey, I could check for recent email, see if a friend has texted me, reload a news app (my favorite is Otherweb), and so on.</p>
<p>As Newport sees it, the problem is not only that the smartphone and related technologies are designed to pull us in, but that we don't have a <em>philosophy</em> of how they ought to fit into our lives. Moreover, we don't take our precious time and attention as seriously as we ought to; thus we find it all too easy to get sucked into endlessly distracting apps, superficial online "connection" via like buttons, and mindless information consumption. This pulls us away from what truly matters: deep learning, human conversation, and meaningful value-creation.</p>
<p>Although I don't actually spend all that much time on my phone, I appreciated Newport's call for digital minimalism (in good Aristotelian fashion, I might prefer to label it digital <em>moderation</em>). As a result of reading his book, I'll be making some further changes to my technology usage, such as checking email and messaging apps less frequently, perhaps deleting my mobile email app so that I send and receive email only on my laptop, and even looking into a minimalist phone like the Mudita Pure.</p>
<p>If I identify any helpful tools or insights, I'll post about them here in the future.</p>

<h2><a href="1766.html">Best Friend Books</a></h2>
<h3>2023-02-12</h3>
<p>It occurs to me that, just as we have circles of friendship, so also we sometimes have circles of influence and affection in the books we read. Certain books and authors are like best friends that we revisit again and again: think of those who cherish the novels of Jane Austen, the <cite>Meditations</cite> of Marcus Aurelius, the <cite>Confessions</cite> of Augustine, or the plays of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Moreover, just as friends come and go through the course of life, so too with books. When I was a teenager I read <cite>The Fountainhead</cite> eight or nine times, which led eventually to my writing <cite>The Tao of Roark</cite>; but we simply haven't kept in touch over the years and its place in my inner circle has been filled by others.</p>
<p>At this point I'd say that my "best friend books" are Aristotle's <cite>Ethics</cite>, the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite>, Thoreau's <cite>Walden</cite>, and the poems of Emily Dickinson. Yet in the coming years I plan to spend much more time with Shakespeare, Montaigne, George Eliot, Jane Austen, and George Santayana, so the list might change.</p>
<p>Which books and authors are some of your best friends?</p>

<h2><a href="1765.html">Career Reflections</a></h2>
<h3>2023-02-09</h3>
<p>Twelve months ago this week I quit my job at Mozilla. Herewith a few reflections on my 25 years in tech.</p>
<p>When in my senior year of college I decided that I would not apply to Ph.D. programs in ancient philosophy, I had very little idea about what I would do in the real world. I started out in corporate training for several years and then got hooked on the early Internet (circa 1995). Those were the heady days before Big Tech, when everything seemed possible. At my first few tech jobs we got paid a decent salary but not the ridiculous sums doled out to tech workers nowadays - that kind of funny money didn't become common until five or ten years ago. Clearly, however, through a program of aggressive savings I did well enough financially because I was able to leave the tech industry in my mid-50s and thus pursue a more contemplative existence later in life.</p>
<p>Seeing and experiencing the relentless centralization - I might even say corruption - of the Internet has been disheartening. In my work on Jabber and many other technologies, I strove to build things that protected personal autonomy and preserved the decentralized foundations of the Internet. Yet all too often, tech companies big and small care about neither of those principles, as I discovered up close while working on the privacy technologies we made at Mozilla to safeguard Firefox users from ubiquitous tracking. It saddens me that a transformational technology that began with such promise and idealism has devolved into a machine for surveillance and manipulation. Indeed, to my mind it's a legitimate question whether, on balance, the Internet has been good for humanity. Ponder that a while and see what you conclude.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, I cherish the opportunities I had to work with hundreds of great colleagues. Even in the toxic companies I had the misfortune to encounter, I made wonderful friends and learned so much about people, teamwork, and organizations. I'm now endeavoring to "give back" by incorporating many of the lessons I learned into the training seminar that my wife Elisa and I are developing for managers, team leaders, and team members.</p>
