<h2><a href="1906.html">Philosophical Hubris</a></h2>
<h3>2024-10-07</h3>
<p>In further reflecting on my recent post about criticism vs. cultivation, I've been pondering the all-too-common phenomenon of philosophical hubris: the attitude among some philosophers that they can pronounce intelligently on any topic or situation presented to them. To such thinkers (parodied as long ago as Plato's <cite>Gorgias</cite>), humility might be an intellectual virtue for others, but it isn't one for <em>them</em>.</p>
<p>As I see it, philosophical hubris is one of the dangers inherent in the proliferation of various isms as "ways of life" - Stoicism, Epicureanism, Pyrrhonism, even (if Alexandre Lefebvre is to be believed) political ideologies like liberalism. As Abraham Maslow is reputed to have said, "if all you have is a hammer then everything looks like a nail" - and you feel free to whack it accordingly. Poor Pierre Hadot, who resurrected the conception of philosophy as a way life: loving and pursuing wisdom is very different from believing and adhering to a particular worldview that provides the answers to all questions.</p>
<p>Yet the true believer is not the only intellectual type who is prone to pontificating. Sophists ancient and modern (e.g., all too many analytic philosophers) have felt confident that their logical and rhetorical training qualifies them to argue successfully about everything under the sun.</p>
<p>I freely admit that in my youth I epitomized this kind of arrogance. In college, when I was considering psychotherapy as a career, a friend of mine reacted by saying "you just want to tell people what to do"; although I was taken aback, at that time there was much truth in the accusation. Having worked at character improvement over many years, hopefully I've mostly outgrown it by now!</p>
<p>To counteract this tendency, I find it helpful to recall the words of Lao Tzu in the final chapter of the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
The wise man doesn't know it all<br>
The know-it-all is far from wise
</blockquote>

<h2><a href="1905.html">Whole Wheat Pancake Recipe</a></h2>
<h3>2024-10-05</h3>
<p>Every once in a while I post a recipe here, almost as much for my own reference as for sharing. Because several people have asked me about my whole wheat pancakes recently, I figured I'd write up how I make them.</p>
<p>There are two sets of ingredients, five wet and five dry:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zest of one orange</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>6 tablespoons canola oil</li>
<li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
<li>¼ cup heavy cream</li>
<li>2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
<li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
<li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
</ul>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk all the dry ingredients. In a smaller mixing bowl, whisk all the wet ingredients. Whisk the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until just mixed and no dry spots remain. Spoon out ¼ cup of batter at a time onto a warm pan or griddle, flip when bubbles start to appear, and serve with maple syrup or your favorite sweetener (orange marmalade is a great choice). Makes 16-18 pancakes.</p>
<p>I use heavy cream because I prefer thick pancakes - substitute with milk if you prefer them thinner. And for a delightfully nutty flavor, use walnut oil instead of canola oil.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h2><a href="1904.html">Criticism vs. Cultivation</a></h2>
<h3>2024-10-04</h3>
<p>So much of what one reads online these days consists of social and cultural criticism, even when it avoids the cesspool of partisan vitriol. Case in point: over the last few days I've run across several essays that bemoan the decline of reading and the seemingly inexorable emergence of a post-literate society. Although I've made similar observations over the years, it strikes me that at a personal level such forms of criticism are nearly devoid of value. Instead, what matters are the practices that one cultivates in one's own life. I grant that exposing oneself to social and cultural criticism can, at times, inspire a change in behavior; yet, all too often, criticism without cultivation is "sound and fury, signifying nothing". Marx proclaimed that "Philosophers have hitherto only <em>interpreted</em> the world in various ways; the point is to <em>change</em> it." Yet I agree more with Tolstoy, who contended that "Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself." If you ask me, changing oneself is the true function of philosophy.</p>

<h2><a href="1903.html">Walking with Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics VII.11-14</a></h2>
<h3>2024-09-24</h3>
<p>Early on in the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle observed that thrivings and corruptions of character are centrally concerned with managing life's pleasures and pains, joys and distresses; as two examples, the cowardly person fails to act courageously out of a desire to avoid even necessary pains, whereas the decadent person fails to act moderately out of a desire to pursue even unnecessary pleasures. Here in Book VII, Aristotle expands on those observations and provides a stronger foundation for his claims.</p>
<p>The key insight is that pleasures and pains are bound up with the activities they accompany, since activities have their own inherent pleasures. The pleasure of, say, solving a challenging math problem is quite different from the pleasure of drinking a big glass of cold water after working outside in the hot sun. More specifically, not all pleasures involve satisfying a craving (e.g., eating sweets) or relieving a pain (e.g., recovering from an illness), for some pleasures arise simply from activating a capacity (e.g., learning a skill) or exercising a natural faculty (e.g., seeing). Because the latter pleasures are not dependent on an outcome whose value lies outside the activity itself, they are good in themselves; they can even be beautifully right (1151b19, 1154a9). Thus Aristotle defines enjoyment or pleasure as the natural, unimpeded activity [energeia] of an acquired trait [hexis], of which he identifies at least six: craft [technē], understanding [epistēmē], insight [nous], wisdom [phronēsis], sagacity [sophia], and the various forms of ethical thriving [aretē]. (The status of craft here is somewhat ambiguous; I'll write about that some other time.)</p>
<p>According to Aristotle, the pleasures that are good in themselves cannot really be taken to excess (1154a13-14); however, his argument isn't clear to me. He might be saying that although you could engage in too much thinking or seeing or what have you (to the exclusion of other important activities), you can't pursue the <em>pleasures</em> of thinking or seeing to excess because those pleasures arise and are pursued only in and through activities that are good in themselves since they are constituents of human fulfillment [eudaimonia] and also are natural manifestations of deeply human capacities and traits. By contrast, the pleasures of eating, drinking, and sex can be taken to excess (which is why we need the virtue of moderation) since they are bound up with activities that human beings share with the other animals and thus are not distinctively human.</p>
<p>Similarly, Aristotle's focus on <em>unimpeded</em> activity is intriguing, but I don't fully understand it yet, either. What are the impediments to the natural activities of our acquired traits? Are they purely external (e.g., physical, social, political) or can they also be internal (e.g., psychological)? Does the lack of impediments lead to what Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi called the state of flow?</p>
<p>These matters might become clearer when we get to Book X, where Aristotle presents a separate and somewhat different account of pleasure. But first we'll go through Books VIII and IX, which provide Aristotle's highly influential analysis of human relationships, especially the activity he calls <em>philia</em> (usually rendered as "friendship" even though it includes love, acquaintanceship, brotherhood, etc.).</p>

<h2><a href="1902.html">Walking with Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics VII.1-10</a></h2>
<h3>2024-09-21</h3>
<p>At the end of Nicomachean Ethics Book VI, Aristotle sketched out an ideal of human flourishing, in the form of the seriously good person who seamlessly combines excellence of mind and character, practical wisdom [phronēsis] and ethical thriving [aretē]. Yet human experience is not always so seamless. There are many ways to go astray in life, which in Book VII Aristotle boils down to three: corruption [mochthēria] of character, lack of self-restraint [akrasia], and, rarely, a deficient state that borders on an animal-like existence [theriotēs].</p>
<p>Aristotle spends most of Book VII puzzling over <em>akrasia</em>, commonly translated as unrestraint (e.g., by Joe Sachs), lack of self-restraint, weakness of the will, moral weakness, or (my current preference) self-indulgence. Unlike the ethically corrupted person, who has a settled commitment to doing what's repulsively wrong [aischros] in one or more domains of life, the akratic person has an understanding of and commitment to what is beautifully right [kalos], yet doesn't always follow through in action. Aristotle adduces two main reasons for this kind of self-indulgence: impulsiveness [propeteia] and weakness [asthenia]. He says that impulsive people don't deliberate about their activities in the first place because they live by emotion; by contrast, weak-willed people, although they deliberate ahead of time, get carried away by their emotions and thus in the end stand aside from their deliberations and commitments. He seems to imply that self-indulgent behavior is especially common in the young, whose character traits and practices are not yet fully formed, although it could manifest itself in immature people of all ages.</p>
<p>Just as the self-indulgent person is different from the ethically corrupted person, so the self-restrained person [enkratēs] is different from the ethically thriving person. Unlike the self-indulgent person, the self-restrained person doesn't give in to their unworthy passions and emotions but instead stands by their deliberations and commitments; yet unlike the seriously good person, whose thoughts and actions and emotions are in harmony, the self-restrained person has unworthy passions and emotions that need to be actively, even steadfastly overcome.</p>
<p>At some level, all three of these - the ethically thriving person, the self-restrained person, and the self-indulgent person - know what's right; yet they differ in their ability to act on what they know. Socrates thought it was impossible to know what's right and not act aright, so he held that weakness of the will doesn't exist: the self-indulgent person may <em>seem</em> to know, but doesn't <em>really</em> know (in their bones, as we would say). Aristotle gets through this impasse by drawing a distinction between <em>having</em> knowledge and actively <em>using</em> that knowledge; thus he argues that in the heat of the moment the self-indulgent person doesn't maintain awareness [theōria] of what's beautifully right [kalos] and of what makes a human life complete [teleia] and fulfilled [eudaimōn]. He likens an episode of self-indulgence to falling asleep, getting drunk, or a bout of insanity: in all of these cases, one is temporarily under the influence of something - a passion (anger, lust, etc.), fatigue, a drug, or a malady - from which one needs to recover, awaken, sober up, or heal before one's knowledge is fully activated and at work [energein] again in the authoritative sense [kurios].</p>
<p>How do wise people [phronimoi] - ethically serious people [spoudaioi] - avoid such episodes? Aristotle provides two clues. First, they foresee the snares of unworthy passions ahead of time and thus awaken themselves and their reasoning (1150b23-24) so that they are prepared to counteract the influence of such passions, rather as Odysseus prepared his crew for their encounter with the Sirens. Second, over time they cultivate settled traits [hexeis] and practices of beautifully right behavior, so that they don't need to face each situation as if it were something completely new; instead, as they mature and become more complete, their deliberations and commitments and activities become consistent and reliable, like a second nature (1152a31).</p>
<p>In the remainder of Book VII, Aristotle turns to an analysis of pleasures/joys and pains/distresses, since character is bound up with how we handle positive and negative emotions in life. We'll discuss those topics in the next section of our walk with Aristotle.</p>

<h3>2024-09-17</h3>
<p>Here's another of my renderings from the Tao Te Ching:</p>
<blockquote>
To know others is intelligence<br>
To know yourself is enlightenment<br>
To master others is strength<br>
To master yourself is power<br>
To be content is wealth<br>
To act with vigor is will<br>
To hold onto the source is endurance<br>
To die unforgotten is ageless life

<p>Wisdom about the value of self-knowledge is spread throughout the world, even if the reality of its practice is far less common...</p>
