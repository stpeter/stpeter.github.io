<h2><a href="1739.html">Thinking Forward</a></h2>
<h3>2022-10-06</h3>
<p>Much of what makes human beings distinctive is what Jacob Bronowski called "a sense of the future" (in addition to his old book by that name, see also more recently <cite>Homo Prospectus</cite> by Seligman, Railton, Baumeister, and Sripada). Certainly most animals can think at least a few minutes or maybe hours in advance, but they're not actively planning months or years ahead of time as humans can. Yet, perhaps under the influence of modern science, our conception of our intellectual capacities is often retrospective: reason is thought to be a faculty that formulates accurate conclusions and stable laws from the evidence we have painfully gathered in the past through induction, experiment, and the like.</p>
<p>However, it seems that the function of reason in human life is just as centrally to imaginatively project future possibilities. When we are "thinking forward", we consider multiple potential routes to attaining what we want in life and from those options we attempt to make a "good enough" decision about what to do based on rough estimations of costs and benefits.</p>
<p>This has several implications for practical wisdom.</p>
<p>First, as long as we are prepared to handle the most likely future paths with some consideration of what could go wrong, then accurate prediction and precise definitions are of secondary importance. This implies that ethical rules matter much less than philosophical theorists like to think. After all, the point of such rules is reduce or eliminate the scope of individual decision-making.</p>
<p>Second, there's no completely reliable way to predict what situations we will face in life: most of them tend to be novel along various dimensions (e.g., there are different people or time pressures or practical implications involved). This doesn't mean that anything goes, but it does mean that we typically use analogical reasoning to solve problems based on similar but not identical patterns we've experienced as well as the decisions we've made in those situations.</p>
<p>Third, a critical component of practical wisdom is means-end planning in its broadest sense. As I hinted a few weeks ago, this is not as simple as it sounds. It's one thing to figure out and visualize our goals within a long-term project or relationship (e.g., "I want to have a happy marriage"), but it's quite another to identify and successfully pursue the full range of thoughts, feelings, attitudes, virtues, principles, policies, and behaviors necessary to achieve those goals (what Aristotle called "things toward the end", many of which are not simple means but active consistuents of the end).</p>
<p>For all these reasons and more, practical wisdom about our future activities holds a central place in human flourishing.</p>

<h2><a href="1738.html">Virtues: One or Many?</a></h2>
<h3>2022-09-29</h3>
<p>In a post last week about the value of studying multiple philosophies, I observed that I have not read much Christian theology. As if on queue, I decided to read Augustine's <cite>Of the Morals of the Catholic Church</cite>, written in 388 CE. The impetus was a footnote on page 179 of Daniel C. Russell's book <cite>Practical Intelligence and the Virtues</cite>, where he said that he would not consider non-secular arguments for the unity of the virtues, such as Augustine's argument that there really is only one virtue, which is the love of God.</p>
<p>This triggered a connection in my mind to Aristotle's view that the virtuous person acts for the sake of what is beautifully right (τὸ καλόν). For Aristotle, this for-the-sake-of relation is true of every excellence of character (courage, temperance, justice, generosity, benevolence, etc.). Could Augustine's position be interestingly similar to Aristotle's? Let's take a look...</p>
<p>Augustine analyzes the four classical virtues as follows (<cite>Of the Morals of the Catholic Church</cite>, Chapter 15):</p>
<blockquote>As to virtue leading us to a happy life, I hold virtue to be nothing else than perfect love of God. For the fourfold division of virtue I regard as taken from four forms of love. For these four virtues (would that all felt their influence in their minds as they have their names in their mouths!), I should have no hesitation in defining them: that temperance is love giving itself entirely to that which is loved; fortitude is love readily bearing all things for the sake of the loved object; justice is love serving only the loved object, and therefore ruling rightly; prudence is love distinguishing with sagacity between what hinders it and what helps it. The object of this love is not anything, but only God, the chief good, the highest wisdom, the perfect harmony. So we may express the definition thus: that temperance is love keeping itself entire and incorrupt for God; fortitude is love bearing everything readily for the sake of God; justice is love serving God only, and therefore ruling well all else, as subject to man; prudence is love making a right distinction between what helps it towards God and what might hinder it.</blockquote>
<p>Although we think of Aristotle as a secular (or at least pre-Christian) thinker, at the very end of the <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite> his ethical reflections take a decidedly theological turn (something similar happens at the end of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>). There he argues that whatever conduces to the cultivation (θεραπεία) and awareness (θεωρία) of god or the divine is best and is the most beautifully right standard for choice and action regarding natural goods such as health, wealth, power, reputation, even personal relationships. The reasons for this theological turn (or was it there all along?) are complex and not entirely clear to me, but I think they involve an ideal of emulating what Aristotle takes to be the divine: the pure activity (ἐνέργεια) of awareness (θεωρία). On this topic I wrote as follows in a blog post from 2019:</p>
<blockquote>Beings are divine to the extent that they engage in the activity of awareness. Thus the highest and best being would, as a kind of limit case, be the one that is self-contained, independent, unchanging, well-ordered, fully aware, and fully engaged in the activity of awareness. Thus human beings are best to the extent that partake in these same qualities (indeed, we form our ideas of the divine from our experience of what is best in human life).</blockquote>
<p>I freely grant that this is all quite speculative. Moreover, having read literally hundreds of scholarly books and articles on Aristotle, I can say definitively that very few modern philosophers are comfortable when Aristotle starts talking about the divine (and some of those few get it quite wrong, for instance when Richard Bodeus argues that Aristotle was defending the conventional, polytheistic religion of classical Greece). Yet Aristotle thought both that a conception of the divine is closely connected to beautifully right commitment and action, and that all excellent human activity is motivated by love and awareness of the highest good. Such ideas might have grounded the widely-accepted ancient doctrine (forms of which we find in Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, and Augustine) that the seemingly separate virtues are really all one thing. As to what the "cash value" of this doctrine might be, I'll explore that in a future post.</p>

<h2><a href="1737.html">What Is Philosophy For?</a></h2>
<h3>2022-09-25</h3>
<p>Occasionally one reads something so singularly misguided that it puts into stark relief a vital concern of human existence. In the case at hand, the vital concern is the place of philosophy in the best life for human beings and the piece of writing is a scholarly paper published just last week by philosopher Hanno Sauer, entitled "The End of History."</p>
<p>Professor Sauer argues that there is little value to be gained in reading the so-called great philosophers of human history: Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, Epictetus, Confucius, Lao Tzu, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza, Hume, Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and all the rest. Sure, their works might be enjoyable and might give us insights into the strange things that people believed in the past, but they are useless toward solving the most important philosophical problems. As he so succinctly puts it: "The epistemic aims of philosophy, if there are any, are largely frustrated by engaging with the history of philosophy."</p>
<p>Naturally this raises the question: what are the aims of philosophy? Philosophy itself, of course, has no aims, any more than biology or history does; it's human beings who have aims and goals and purposes. And the human beings whom Professor Sauer has in mind are his fellow practitioners of theoretical philosophy, whose aims are, as he puts it, epistemic. In ancient Greek, ἐπιστήμη was deep understanding of a particular domain and an ἐπιστημής was a person possessing that kind of deep understanding - in modern parlance, an expert. Thus the question of "the epistemic aims of philosophy" can be converted into this: "what is the role in human life of experts in theoretical philosophy?"</p>
<p>All the ancient philosophers - Greek, Chinese, Indian, Roman - were in agreement that philosophy is the love of wisdom and that wisdom help us make good everyday decisions about how to live well as human beings in human societies; thus philosophy is primarily a way of life and only very much secondarily a theoretical pursuit. As one prominent example, Aristotle held that wisdom (σοφία) is a combination of knowledge (ἐπιστήμη) and insight (νοῦς); thus the epistemic aims of philosophy do not stand alone but must be wedded to insight into the highest good attainable by human beings.</p>
<p>When I first discovered Pierre Hadot's reconstruction of philosophy as a way of life over ten years ago, I summarized this ancient viewpoint as follows:</p>
<blockquote>To be a philosopher meant to live a philosophical life: not a life of theoretical hair-splitting, but a life of practical wisdom, active reason and reasoned action, deep reflection, true consciousness, vibrant awareness, moral ambition, never-ending spiritual practice, continual striving after self-improvement, the exercise of all your faculties, skillfulness in the great task of living a fully human life.</blockquote>
<p>Therefore the class of philosophical problems that Professor Sauer and his ilk see as central - the nature of knowledge, of the human mind, of natural laws, of linguistic meaning, and even of a just society - take a back seat to the personal cultivation of human virtue and excellence. From this perspective, experts in theoretical philosophy must play a decidedly nonessential role in human life - which is exactly the role they play nowadays, since they are writing only for each other, and even their colleagues in related fields of science and scholarship rarely listen to them, let alone the general public.</p>
<p>This is ironic, because Professor Sauer argues that philosophers of the past have nothing to add to "current philosophical debates," the reason being that they lacked the most up-to-date "empirical and scientific information" (say, fMRI studies within neuropsychology). It is unclear what he would consider to be the expiration date for intellectual relevance, but in relation to his preferred philosophical problems it could be a matter of mere years. Indeed, his focus on "current philosophical debates" shows where his allegiances lie: with philosophy as a sort of cutting-edge scientific or mathematical research, ever chasing the most novel arguments, the latest proofs, the hottest controversies.</p>
<p>Moreover, even when Professor Sauer grants that philosophy has its humanistic aspects, all that he can conjure up is "preserving the cultural heritage of humanity" and "sustaining our ability to comprehend a body of difficult texts whose content may fade into oblivion without such stewardship." However, if those texts are literally harmful, what's the point? We'd all be better off forgetting about outdated works of philosophy. Paraphrasing the hippies, don't read anything over thirty!</p>
<p>This kind of presentism entails numerous dangers, well summarized by Santayana's maxim "Those who cannot remember the past, are condemned to repeat it." Yet most fundamentally, it demonstrates utter ignorance of the truly humanistic role of philosophy in the life of the individual and society: not philological preservation of difficult and useless old texts, but active guidance toward successful living and human flourishing.</p>

<h2><a href="1736.html">Exploring Philosophies</a></h2>
<h3>2022-09-22</h3>
<p>In his magisterial cultural history of the last 500 years (<cite>From Dawn to Decadence</cite>), the late Jacques Barzun wrote as follows about the study of history (pp. 568-569):</p>
<blockquote>Any writer of history aims at stating the truth, but that is only ancillary to the central role of the discipline, which is to present patterns and permit the welter of facts to be reconceived.... If one is well versed in the facts one may question the historian's estimate of persons or deplore events that he celebrates, but these disagreements leave a vast edifice standing and not to be seen anywhere else.... The dissenter who says "it was not like that" is in the situation of friends passing judgment on another friend: "He did this, which means that." "No, it doesn't, because he also did that, which means this." The dispute cannot end unless each side responds to the challenge: "Tell me what your standard of action is." At that point, barring factual errors that both sides will acknowledge in good faith, each will retire probably unconverted. Such is the reason for saying that a reader of history must be a reader of histor<em>ies</em> - several on the same topic - and a judge at leisure on the points in conflict.</blockquote>
<p>The same applies to the pursuit of wisdom: it's not enough to study only one philosopher or one school of thought. Just as with history, life presents a welter of facts that need to be repeatedly reconceived and re-examined (recall Socrates: "the unexamined life is not worth living for a human being"). And a key tool for that mental and spiritual work is to reflect on human experience and the facts of your own life from multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>Indeed, the similarities between history and philosophy on this point might be part of why Henry St John (1st Viscount Bolingbroke) said that "History is philosophy teaching by example and also by warning."</p>
<p>As to my own exploration of philosophies (or as I once called them the "Minerval Arts"), you might have noticed that these days I post frequently about Aristotle; that's because I'm writing a book about his views on human flourishing. However, not only have I previously written books on Epicurus, Thoreau, Nietzsche, and Rand, but I've also read quite a bit about Montaigne, Spinoza, the Stoics, phenomenology, Taoism, and Confucianism (admittedly less about, say, Indian philosophy, existentialism, and Christian theology).</p>
<p>One of the wonderful but also challenging aspects of engaging in philosophy as a way of life today is that we have access to every major philosophical and theological tradition that has ever existed <em>plus</em> the multifarious schools of psychology, anthropology, sociology, and history. Although it's impossible for any one person to integrate all of this knowledge into a seamless whole, having so many angles of vision can give us more comprehensive insight into the complexity of human life. Rather than seeing this as a liability, I prefer to see it as an opportunity for achieving greater wisdom.</p>
<p>Spoken like a true philosopher, I suppose!</p>

<h3>2022-09-15</h3>
<p>In a recent post entitled "How a Business Wins", Arnold Kling made the following observation:</p>
<blockquote>Building a business, especially an innovative business in a complex environment, requires many, many decisions. You can be lucky with any one decision, but to get enough decisions right to make the business work takes much more than luck.</blockquote>
<p>As hinted in my post "Compounding Wisdom" two years ago, this insight applies to more than just business. Your health, your marriage, your friendships, your financial stability, your character - long-term success in each of these requires many decisions over the course of many years.</p>
<p>The fundamental principle involved was identified by Aristotle 2400 years ago: we are what we habitually do. Therefore it's crucial to develop a consistent <em>practice</em> of good decision-making, which is what Aristotle called practical wisdom (in ancient Greek, φρόνησις). I've been giving a lot of thought to this topic of late and will have more to say about it in the coming weeks.</p>

<h2><a href="1734.html">Means and Ends</a></h2>
<h3>2022-09-08</h3>
<p>Last week we looked at the distinction between internal goods, external goods, and shared goods. At that time I touched on a further distinction between means and ends in life. Here again Aristotle can be of assistance, because he discusses these matters in his two major books about character and action, which have come down to us as the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> and the <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite>.</p>
<p>Significantly, for Aristotle these means to an end are not always or primarily instrumental. Indeed, the phrase usually translated as "means" actually denotes "things toward the end", i.e., good things that enable us to accomplish our ends or goals. Several modern scholars of Aristotle have observed that these good things can be essential constituents or integral components of our ends or goals. Moreover, for Aristotle the goal or purpose (τέλος) of life is a form of characteristic human activity that simply IS living well. Thus for Aristotle eudaimonia (traditionally translated as "happiness" but often more recently as "flourishing") is not a feeling but an activity.</p>
<p>Consider the example of marriage. For the sake of discussion, let's define marriage as (ideally) a lifelong partnership in pursuit of the best that life has to offer founded in mutual love, respect, dialogue, and compassion. Imagine that someone who is offered the possibility of that experience were to say: "that sounds great, but what's in it for me?" The implication is that it's not enough for such a relationship to constitute an essential component of their flourishing existence; they want the relationship to provide a guarantee of their own personal pleasure and satisfaction.</p>
<p>From an Aristotelian perspective, this is incoherent. Because we are social animals, the presence of such a relationship in one's life is directly fulfilling and enjoyable, for it is integral to living the best life for a human being. To view such a relationship in an instrumental fashion is to assume that one's own pleasure and satisfaction is the primary good in life; that is, it is to accept the ethical philosophy of hedonism. And, in turn, that philosophy is false because it doesn't do justice to the full range and depth of human activity.</p>
