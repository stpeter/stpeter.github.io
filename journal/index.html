<h2><a href="2014.html">Soul Workout</a></h2>
<h3>2025-12-21</h3>
<p>While reading Eric Hoffer's book <cite>The Passionate State of Mind</cite>, I came across some thought-provoking aphorisms about self-knowledge, self-deception, and personal identity. Here are the key sentences, which I've extracted and strung together for my own purposes:</p>
<blockquote>Far more crucial than what we know or do not know is what we do not want to know. (§58)</blockquote>
<blockquote>To most of us nothing is so invisible as an unpleasant truth. (§59)</blockquote>
<blockquote>The weakness of a soul is proportionate to the number of truths that must be kept from it. (§61)</blockquote>
<blockquote>Our credulity is greatest concerning the things we know least about. And since we know least about ourselves, we are ready to believe all that is said about us. (§128)</blockquote>
<blockquote>When we are not governed too much by what other people think of us, we are likely to be tolerant toward the behavior and the opinions of others. So, too, when we do not crave to seem important we are not awed by the importance of others. (§134)</blockquote>
<p>As noted recently, although Hoffer had a powerful nose for generalizations about the foibles and failings of humanity, I prefer to translate such pronouncements into the personal, the particular, and (I might add) the positive.</p>
<p>Thus I ask myself:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How can I strengthen my soul by facing unpleasant truths about myself?</li>
  <li>What don't I want to know about myself?</li>
  <li>What do I falsely believe about myself because other people say it's so?</li>
  <li>Am I overly governed by what other people think of me?</li>
  <li>Am I less tolerant than I could be of other people's behavior and opinions?</li>
  <li>Do I have a craving for seeming important to other people?</li>
</ul>
<p>The attempt to answer these questions will require so much self-discipline that it'll be like a workout regimen for the soul! If I make any progress (perhaps with a little help from my friends, or even from Shakespeare), I'll report back...</p>

<h2><a href="2013.html">Philosophy and Psychology</a></h2>
<h3>2025-12-15</h3>
<p>Sometime in the next few weeks my friend Adrian Lory and I will hold a Substack Live video conversation about philosophy and psychology as complementary paths to wisdom and fulfillment. In preparation, I've been thinking up some questions about the relationship between philosophy and psychology, as well as their respective contributions to the good life. Here's what I have so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the psychological construct of subjective well-being the best measure of happiness or fulfillment? Can a person's flourishing be measured scientifically? What do we gain and lose by defining such measures?</li>
<li>Traditional philosophy was more judgmental than modern psychology (e.g., Socrates asserted that the unexamined life is not worth living, which implies that some ways of life have more worth than others). Does an emphasis on environmental factors or in-born personality dispositions as opposed to acquired character traits or virtues and vices deprive us of important insights into human behavior?</li>
<li>Both philosophy and psychology contain movements or schools of thought; how do these "isms" contribute to or detract from the underlying goal of philosophical enlightenment or psychological health?</li>
<li>Can or should psychology formulate an equivalent to Pierre Hadot's identification of philosophy as a way of life?</li>
<li>From its ancient roots, philosophy has been centered around the passionate practice of wisdom and the ideal of the sage (e.g., Socrates, Confucius, the Buddha). How does this differ from the scientific, value-neutral aspirations of psychology?</li>
<li>At the very end of the Eudemian Ethics Aristotle argues that the highest and best standard of soulcraft is to base one's choices on the cultivation of the divine aspects of personhood, where the Greek word for cultivation is therapeia. How does psychological therapy differ from this (admittedly vague) notion of philosophical therapeia?</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay tuned for details about the Substack Live session and be sure to subscribe to Adrian's Substack so that you can see what fascinating questions he's been thinking up. :-)</p>

<h2><a href="2012.html">Change and Revolution</a></h2>
<h3>2025-12-14</h3>
<p>In his book <cite>First Things, Last Things</cite>, Eric Hoffer makes some observations about change and revolution:</p>
<blockquote>We used to think that revolution is the cause of change. Actually it is the other way around: revolution is a by-product of change. Change comes first, and it is the difficulties and irritations inherent in change which set the stage for revolution. To say that revolution is the cause of change is like saying that juvenile delinquency is the cause of the change from boyhood to manhood.</blockquote>
<blockquote>[P]eople who undergo drastic change recapitulate to some degree the passage from childhood to manhood, and mass movements are in a sense the juvenile delinquency of societies going through the ordeal of change. The juvenile, then, is the archetypal man in transition. There is a family likeness between juveniles and people who migrate from one country to another, or are converted from one faith to another, or pass from one way of life to another....</blockquote>
<p>Although Hoffer's primary interest here is change and revolution in society (see also his most famous book, <cite>The True Believer</cite>), I wonder if something similar applies to individuals. Consider two quotes from Tolstoy:</p>
<blockquote>Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>There can be only one permanent revolution - a moral one: the regeneration of the inner man.</blockquote>
<p>Could it be that the inner revolution of personal regeneration is often made possible by a move to another country, joining a different faith, pursuing a new career, getting married, getting divorced, becoming a parent, or some other change in one's way of life?</p>
<p>To me it seems more likely that in these matters causation is bidirectional. After all, personal regeneration simply <em>is</em> changing oneself - or, more accurately, a change in oneself. Yevgeny Zamyatin once wrote that "there is no final revolution", which at the personal level implies that one needs to keep changing throughout life based on one's ever-widening range of insight and experience; indeed, living an examined life requires nothing less.</p>

<h2><a href="2011.html">The Universalist Temptation</a></h2>
<h3>2025-12-10</h3>
<p>The other day in my post about Making It Personal, I wrote as follows:</p>
<blockquote>I have taken to translating universal claims and observations into practices that I can apply in my own life (and ignoring them if they cannot be so translated).</blockquote>
<p>Today I'd like to focus on that last part, because over time I've found that my To-Don't List can be even more beneficial than my To-Do List.</p>
<p>It strikes me that most of the books, news articles, blog posts, advice columns, and Internet memes floating around out there are implicitly or explicitly universalist: they talk about how society needs to change, about how "we" (always undefined) need to take certain actions, about how everyone should do what the writer or influencer says, etc. Yet changing society, modifying government policy, or convincing everyone to act in a certain way is completely outside my span of influence and control.</p>
<p>Yes, I freely grant that it's awfully tempting to make such universal claims; for much of my life I did the same thing myself! However, I've learned that when I give in to this temptation I immediately start weaving a tangled web of unrealistic hopes and self-righteous expectations, which inexorably pulls me into a cycle of anger and frustration ("why don't other people do what I think they should do?!").</p>
<p>This temptation to universalism is itself nearly universal: it seems to lie at the root of politics, activism, punditry, and far too much of philosophy, psychology, religion, literary criticism, sociology, and similar disciplines.</p>
<p>For myself, I've discovered that attempting to translate universal prescriptions into personal practices provides an effective filter on the endless stream of news, advice, and propaganda; and if a source of such information is too insistent, I simply start ignoring it. And in my own writing I try to scrupulously avoid the universalist temptation.</p>
<p>Naturally, I'm not saying that you should start doing things my way or that society needs to become less universalistic, because if I did then I'd be caught in the same old web...</p>

<h2><a href="2010.html">Making It Personal</a></h2>
<h3>2025-12-08</h3>
<p>My increasingly strong commitment to personalism and particularism has prompted me to make some changes in how I read, think, and act. Specifically, I have taken to translating universal claims and observations into practices that I can apply in my own life (and ignoring them if they cannot be so translated).</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the following opinion expressed by Eric Hoffer in his book <cite>First Things, Last Things</cite>: "My hunch is that to keep stable and healthy a free, affluent society must become a creative society." Universally speaking, that claim may or may not be true (it's not clear to me how we would prove it). However, if I agree with its underlying aim then there are two paths I can take.</p>
<p>The <em>public path</em> would be to advocate for a more creative society, write books and articles about the importance of beauty and the arts in human experience, donate time and money to museums and other cultural organizations, lobby the government for increased public funding of the arts, and so on.</p>
<p>The <em>private path</em>, by contrast, is simple and direct: I could <em>be more creative</em>. For instance, I could study classical guitar, compose music, write poems, pursue nature photography, observe the movements of birds and animals, read great literature, watch the sun rise and set, gaze up at the moon and stars, contemplate paintings and sculptures in my own house or at museums and galleries, learn more about the history of the arts, apply my mind to answering novel questions in philosophical aesthetics, and so on.</p>
<p>Oh wait, I already do all those things! It seems that at a deeply personal level I agree with Hoffer's claim, because I'm working to make it real in my own life - taking, however, the quiet, private path rather than the noisy, public path. Since nowadays our society seems to honor public things far above private things, we could even call this taking the road less traveled by. So far in my pursuit of human fulfillment, doing so has made all the difference.</p>

<h2><a href="2009.html">Varieties of Beauty</a></h2>
<h3>2025-12-03</h3>
<p>Beauty is not limited to the arts (indeed, art is not always beautiful, but that's another topic). This set me to thinking about the many sorts of things that we humans can call beautiful:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Atmospheric phenomena: sunsets, cloud formations, rainbows, fogs, etc.</li>
  <li>Astronomical phenomena: the moon, the stars, the Milky Way, comets, etc.</li>
  <li>Geological phenomena: mountains, valleys, deserts, islands, rock formations, etc.</li>
  <li>Materials: gold, silver, gemstones, etc.</li>
  <li>Waters: rivers, lakes, inlets, waterfalls, etc.</li>
  <li>Plants: trees, shrubs, vines, flowers, etc.</li>
  <li>Animals: dolphins, cheetahs, eagles, hummingbirds, butterflies, etc.</li>
  <li>Movements of animals: running, leaping, flying, soaring, etc.</li>
  <li>People and their parts: faces, hands, eyes, etc.</li>
  <li>Artifacts: pottery, jewelry, tools, books, cars, etc.</li>
  <li>Arts: poems, music, sculpture, painting, etc.</li>
  <li>Performances: plays, dances, concerts, etc.</li>
  <li>Buildings: houses, churches, temples, skyscrapers, etc.</li>
  <li>Events: weddings, festivals, coronations, etc.</li>
  <li>Sports and games: soccer, baseball, tennis, chess, etc.</li>
  <li>Sciences: mathematics, physics, biology, etc.</li>
  <li>Actions: giving, caring, etc.</li>
  <li>Emotions: love, affection, transcendence, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>And these are still quite general: it's not all of mathematics that we consider beautiful, but certain equations (e.g., Euler's equation and Maxwell's equations); in baseball, a well-turned double play can be a thing of beauty, but a routine fly ball not so much; and so on.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these beautiful things exhibit a wide range of attractive qualities, such as: fluidity, simplicity, intricacy, purity, polish, smoothness, sleekness, elegance, proportion, symmetry, asymmetry, line, composition, arrangement, form, structure, solidity, color, tone, rhythm, harmony, aliveness, permanence, evanescence, transcendence, earthiness, spontaneity, precision, virtuosity, imagination. It's not a mistake that some of these qualities are - or at least seem to be - at odds with each other. For instance, we might value precision and virtuosity in a musical performance, but if it's too precise it might start to feel robotic. Similarly, criteria of beauty can vary across times and cultures; as one example, in some East Asian cultures people rate symmetry less highly than people did in classical Greece.</p>
<p>The endless variety and particularity of beautiful things might make theoretical speculation more difficult, but they also give us so much celebrate and explore in the natural and human worlds.</p>
