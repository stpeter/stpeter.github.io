<h2><a href="1716.html">Isms and Wisdom</a></h2>
<h3>2022-05-19</h3>
<p>Which came first, the ism or the wisdom?</p>
<p>The answer is clear: there were wise people for at least tens of thousands of years before philosophical isms were invented around the sixth century BCE by the likes of Thales, Confucius, and Siddhartha Gautama. As Pierre Hadot rediscovered through his historical research into philosophy as a way of life, in ancient Greece theoretical philosophy grew out of and was secondary to the "spiritual exercises" of practical philosophy. Thus, for instance, a wise person might act stoically but that doesn't mean Stoicism makes you a wise person. The same is true for the signature virtues of Epicureanism, Christianity, Taoism, Buddhism, and all the rest.</p>
<p>One thing that an ism gives you is a credo: an easy way to separate those in your group from those outside your group. Thus, for instance, in Christianity the Nicene Creed became a convenient way to determine if you were dealing with a heretic (say, a gnostic) rather than an orthodox believer. And, as far as I've been able to determine, the gnostics were more focused on gaining wisdom than on gaining adherents (see <cite>The Gnostic Gospels</cite> by Elaine Pagels).</p>
<p>The worry one hears from adherents of a particular ism is that if you borrow insights from other schools of thought then you're stooping to mere eclecticism (which isn't an ism in the same sense as Stoicism or Buddhism or whatever). I used to share that worry too, but then I realized what really matters is to be a successful human being, not a dedicated follower of an existing creed.</p>

<h2><a href="1715.html">Big Idea People</a></h2>
<h3>2022-05-12</h3>
<p>When we think of philosophy, we tend to think of theoretical philosophy: cloistered academics, armchair thinkers, and dreamy contemplatives arguing over the fine points of abstruse topics that have little if any practical import. This reputation is, unfortunately, well-deserved, especially in recent times. Yet if we accept the validity of philosophy as a way of life, then these "big idea people" fall short of the ideal. There's a significant difference between the love of ideas for their own sake and the love of wisdom for the sake of livng well. I'm not saying you can't combine the two, but the second is more valuable than the first because it is the foundation not just for intellectual fascination but for human flourishing. I discussed related matters in a talk I gave at the University of Colorado a few years ago, entitled "You're Majoring in What?!? Why Philosophy is a Foundation for Success"...</p>

<h2><a href="1714.html">Live Long and Prosper</a></h2>
<h3>2022-05-05</h3>
<p>Recently I came across a study entitled "Longevity increased by positive self-perceptions of aging" (Levy et al. 2002 - apparently Becca Levy has a new book out entitled <cite>Breaking the Age Code</cite>, which I have not read yet). The abstract states: "This research found that older individuals with more positive self-perceptions of aging, measured up to 23 years earlier, lived 7.5 years longer than those with less positive self-perceptions of aging. This advantage remained after age, gender, socioeconomic status, loneliness, and functional health were included as covariates." As Spock would say: fascinating!</p>
<p>Because America is such a youth-oriented (perhaps even youth-obsessed) society, we tend to have negative perceptions of older people and of aging in general. Yet aging is part of living, and a truly biocentric philosophy should do justice to the full span of life. To be sure, there are things one might not eagerly look forward to (health issues, losing loved ones, etc.), just as there are things one might not fondly look back on from one's early life (bad decisions, foolish actions, etc.). But on balance there are many positive opportunities for flourishing and prospering as one gets older: opportunities to engage in lifelong learning, to master new skills, to pursue a long-delayed avocation, to complete passion projects, to deepen one's relationships, to become a grandparent, to travel, to tend one's garden literally or figuratively, to impart knowledge to younger generations, to reap the compounding effects of wisdom, and so on. The last of these is especially relevant to philosophy as a way of life, because there's no inherent limit to the acquisition and practice of wisdom.</p>
<p>Live long and prosper, indeed!</p>

<h2><a href="1713.html">Philosophical Forms and Functions</a></h2>
<h3>2022-05-03</h3>
<p>Following up on my post a few months ago about philosophical professionalism, I've been thinking about the many forms of philosophical writing and their functions in our intellectual and practical life. Throughout history, philosophical questions and answers have been presented in so many written forms: aphorisms, dialogues, essays, letters, allegories, parables, stories, novels, plays, poems, lectures, sermons, manifestos, journals, memoirs, biographies, autobiographies, epitomes, proofs, puzzles, thought experiments, dissertations, treatises, and scholarly papers. Yet it's only the last few of these that are acceptable these days in academic philosophy. Even a widely-cited essay like Thomas Nagel's "What Is it Like to Be a Bat?" probably wouldn't get published in an academic journal these days, and that's a shame.</p>
<p>These various forms of philosophical writing serve an equally wide variety of philosophical functions: wondering, exploring, observing, analyzing, summarizing, persuading, justifying, proving, exhorting, exemplifying, reminding, distilling, combating, warning, consoling, guiding, and so on. Here again, the modern culture of theoretical philosophy isn't interested in all of these functions, and likely doesn't consider them all of them to be philosophical in the first place - even though they were pursued by foundational thinkers in philosophical traditions both West and East.</p>
<p>Even deeper, there's the question of written vs. oral discourse. Socrates, of course, was famous for not writing anything down, because he believed that the love and practice of wisdom comes to life only in the back-and-forth of human conversation. You can't ask questions of, and receive answers, from a book! Plato tried to overcome the limitations of writing by creating dialogues that were an imitation of real-life Socratic conversations (indeed, in the <cite>Poetics</cite> Aristotle called such dialogues a form of representational art).</p>
<p>Although I try to keep my blog posts fairly conversational, they're no substitute for <em>actual</em> conversation. Whether you're interested in my philosophical coaching services or just want to explore the issues I raise here, I always welcome you to contact me via email, LinkedIn, or even the dreaded Twitter (which I log into only a few times a year!).</p>

<h2><a href="1712.html">Wisdom and Freedom</a></h2>
<h3>2022-04-28</h3>
<p>Why do we continue to find such value in the life wisdom of ancient philosophers like Socrates, Aristotle, Confucius, Lao Tzu, Siddhartha Gautama, Epicurus, and Epictetus? It's not as if we're still reading Ptolemy on astronomy or even Euclid on geometry, so why have these philosophical insights endured?</p>
<p>In the first chapter of his book <cite>The Pursuit of Unhappiness</cite>, Daniel Haybron makes a fascinating observation: the ancient philosophers deeply pondered the nature of happiness and the good life because they thought that most people make a mess of things! In some sense it's the very elitism of these philosophers that gives their wisdom lasting value.</p>
<p>By contrast, we moderns are much more egalitarian: we think that everyone is an expert at living their own life. Because individual freedom is our highest value, we don't tend to produce great new insights into how best to live. (An alternative explanation might be that there are only so many ways to live, and most of them were identified in the early wisdom traditions.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, given the prevalence of depression, divorce, drug addiction, and other sources of sadness, it's clear that we moderns aren't necessarily experts at living. Furthermore, our so-called experts (writers of self-help books and the like) often offer shallow advice consisting of life hacks and happy talk.</p>
<p>It seems to me that there's got to be a way to marry the best of ancient wisdom traditions and modern freedom traditions. I'm hopeful that trends like positive psychology and philosophical personalism are leading in that direction, but there's a lot more work to be done in weaving these various strands together into a beautiful and lasting tapestry.</p>

<h2><a href="1711.html">Exploring Social Space</a></h2>
<h3>2022-04-24</h3>
<p>One of the insights I find so intriguing from ecological psychology as developed by James and Eleanor Gibson is the concept of exploring visual space. Animals (including we humans) aren't simplistic sensory processing machines that are fixed to a point in space; instead, we are free to move around in order to see things from multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>Consider a simple object like the blue mug on my desk.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blue-mug.jpg"></p>
<p>If you were limited to viewing this mug from only one particular angle, it's possible that all you'd see is a blotch of blue. But because you can move around the mug or move the mug around, you can easily discover that the mug has a handle (an affordance for gripping it), that it's hollow inside with a solid bottom (an affordance for filling it with liquid), etc.</p>
<p>An analogy I'd like to think about further is the exploration of social space, with its associated discovery of what I recently called social affordances (of course there are other kinds of space, such as natural space, intellectual space, and inner space). From birth we humans are continually engaged in social learning by pushing against constraints, accomodating ourselves to interpersonal realities, trying new behaviors, building new relationships, formulating new goals, and modifying our thoughts, priorities, actions, and reactions based on what we've learned (consider activities like "the terrible twos", adolescent acting out, dating, travel, and early-career job hopping). And we do this in every domain of social life: family, friendships, school, work, community, etc. Indeed, I'm coming to see that a great deal of human existence consists in the exploration and navigation of social space.</p>
<p>What are the implications? They're not fully clear to me because I'm no expert in the fields of sociology, anthropology, or social psychology. However, as with everything else, different people do a better or worse job at this task of living (consider those with "dark triad" personality traits who manipulate family members or co-workers) and experience plays a large role because it takes years to figure out how to navigate the social world (human psychology and relationships are complicated!).</p>
