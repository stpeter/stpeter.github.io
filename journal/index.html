<h2><a href="1790.html">Chosen Wisdom</a></h2>
<h3>2023-06-20</h3>
<p>The longer I study and practice philosophy, the more value I find in a wide variety of wisdom traditions. When I first became interested in philosophy at the age of 12, it was exclusively in the form of Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism. About this philosophy I was, at least throughout my teenage years, thoroughly dogmatic: all the other philosophies were riddled with error - not even worth considering - and Rand's philosophy simply <em>was</em> philosophy as far as I was concerned. (To be clear, the fault was not Rand's but my own - I could have been just as dogmatic about Stoicism or existentialism.)</p>
<p>Ironically, it was by taking a course on the history of philosophy with a confirmed Objectivist that I experienced the first inklings of doubt. Delving into Aristotle in college opened my eyes further, but I would be lying if I said that I quickly realized the error of my ways. In fact, it took me years - decades - to see that philosophy is more of a verb than a noun, more of an activity than an established body of doctrine. To my mind, this implies that the point of philosophy is not to identify with or adhere to a particular school of thought, but to approach the deepest philosophical questions in a spirit of wonder and to independently discover the wisest answers wherever you may find them.</p>
<p>Dogmatists might derisively call this eclecticism. Yet, to strike at the root (as Thoreau once put it), in ancient Greek <em>eklektikos</em> meant being selective, exercising discernment, using your critical faculties, coming to first-hand judgments about the truth of things. To come full circle, this is entirely consistent with the very best of Rand's conception of reason, which she said is founded in "the independent mind that recognizes no authority higher than its own and no value higher than its judgment of truth."</p>
<p>It stands to reason that no one school of philosophy can do justice to the manifest complexities of human life, for we need multiple different perspectives to make sense of it all. At the same time, the different schools often see the same truths but assign them different emphases or express them in different terms, and part of the fun of philosophy as a way of life is seeing those deep connections across schools and thinkers.</p>
<p>To go even further, whatever chosen wisdom I achieve cannot be exactly the same as yours, because my activity of sense-making is not exactly the same as yours (that's the way minds work). This doesn't mean that all truth is utterly relative - for there are human universals like language, sociality, and autonomy - but it does mean that dialogue is fundamental to the love and practice of wisdom. Which is precisely what Socrates recognized 2500 years ago when he said that the unexamined life is not worth living, because we examine life both on our own and together in the everyday activities of work, love, family, friendship, and community. Anything less is less than fully human.</p>

<h2><a href="1789.html">More Humanity</a></h2>
<h3>2023-06-17</h3>
<p>The other day I observed that, in the balance between mindlessly using technology and deliberately honoring people's humanity (including my own), I tilt toward more humanity. But how does that cash out in everyday life?</p>
<p>In case it might prove helpful to readers, I figured I'd describe some of my personal policies and practices in relation to digital technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't use Facebook. To keep in touch with friends and family, I see them in person or talk with them via phone (preferred) or video.</li>
<li>In between visits and calls, I communicate via email or text - indeed, I'd still write physical letters, but I haven't found anyone who wants to do that anymore!</li>
<li>I don't use Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, etc.</li>
<li>Although I do still have a Twitter account, I log into it only a few times a year.</li>
<li>I visit YouTube only on occasion (e.g., to watch those helpful how-to videos or give an initial listen to hard-to-find music), and only in a private browsing window without logging into Google. I never click any of the videos that YouTube's algorithms recommend.</li>
<li>Speaking of Google, although I have a Google account, I log into it only when absolutely necessary and only in Google Chrome (which is not my everyday browser). Otherwise I use DuckDuckGo for search, Fastmail for email, Jitsi for video chat, and Brave or Firefox for browsing.</li>
<li>I have a smartphone, but I've installed only a bare minimum of apps on it.</li>
<li>On both my phone and my computer, I have popup notifications and "badges" (e.g., unread message counts) disabled.</li>
<li>I use a VPN to hide my real IP address from websites I visit.</li>
<li>I don't play any phone or computer games.</li>
<li>I have my phone interface set to greyscale so that the garish colors of the icons don't draw me in. For reading purposes, I use a mobile browser (Firefox in private browsing mode) in which I have images disabled.</li>
<li>I have autocorrect and autocomplete disabled on all my devices.</li>
<li>I try to use my phone as little as possible, and then mostly for reading, a bit of texting with the few people who know my phone number, and necessary workflows (e.g., two-factor authentication).</li>
<li>I haven't watched TV in 10-15 years.</li>
<li>Once in a while I listen to jazz or classical music on the radio if I happen to be in the car, but I turn it off at the top of the hour when they recite the news.</li>
<li>Although I read news headlines once a day (usually at wsj.com or text.npr.org), I don't read the actual news stories. Other than that, I avoid news websites (see above on algorithmic recommendations).</li>
<li>In preference to new websites, once or twice a week I make a scan of analytical articles at blogs and online magazines that I've found insightful, and I selectively read perhaps 20% of the articles.</li>
<li>In preference to blogs and magazines, I read books. I sometimes read old public-domain books online after I have posted them at my monadnock.net website, but for other books I don't use an e-reader; instead, I check physical books out of the library, often sourced via interlibrary loan because most of the books I read are less popular works of philosophy, history, science, and poetry. If a book I've taken out of the library seems especially useful for one of my research projects, I buy it used through bookfinder.com and mark it up while reading.</li>
</ul>
<p>To generalize, here are ten principles that I try to put into practice:</p>
<ol>
<li>Focus on my most important projects and relationships.</li>
<li>Follow my own priorities and interests, not what's trending or recommended.</li>
<li>Avoid technologies that can manipulate me through individualized profiling and algorithmic "personalization".</li>
<li>Eliminate distractions.</li>
<li>Prefer reading text over viewing images and videos.</li>
<li>Prefer in-person interactions over technologically-mediated interactions.</li>
<li>Prefer old technologies over new technologies.</li>
<li>Prefer slow technologies over fast technologies.</li>
<li>Prefer knowledge over information.</li>
<li>Prefer wisdom over knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<p>As I endeavor to live in accordance with these principles, I'll continue to reflect on them and hone them further.</p>

<h2><a href="1788.html">Software is Eating Our Humanity</a></h2>
<h3>2023-06-15</h3>
<p>While reading Stefan Zweig's book <cite>The World of Yesterday</cite> recently, I came across the following quote:</p>
<blockquote>It seems almost like Nature's fierce revenge on mankind that all the achievements of technology through which we have taken her mysterious forces into our own hands simultaneously destroy the soul. The greatest curse brought down on us by technology is that it prevents us from escaping the present even for a brief time. Previous generations could retreat into solitude and seclusion when disaster struck; it was our fate to be aware of everything catastrophic happening anywhere in the world at the hour and the second when it happened.</blockquote>
<p>Mind you, Zweig was writing about the 1930s! A prophetic statement indeed.</p>
<p>Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen is well known for declaring that "software is eating the world"; a corollary (since human beings are at the center of our world) is that software is eating our humanity. More and more, our interactions with each other, with our history, with ideas, with art, and even with physical reality are mediated by technology: to choose a few examples, by voice-response systems, website input forms, chatbots, in-car info screens, medical appointment scripts (wherein your doctor looks primarily at a screen, not you the patient), smartphones, social media apps, news and entertainment algorithms, and soon artificial intelligence and augmented reality.</p>
<p>Yet "mediated" is such an insipid word, isn't it? In truth, all too often it is our most human characteristics - our spontaneity, our creativity, our sociality, our empathy, our imagination, our individuality, or in old-fashioned language our soul - that our technologies constrain, ignore, suppress, and destroy.</p>
<p>At the same time, the human world is inherently a technological world because we have been tool-makers for millions of years. The question is always: do our tools serve us, or do we serve our tools? To me, increasingly it feels like the latter. (Yet it could be merely a matter of age: perhaps I'm comfortable with older technologies but not with newer ones.)</p>
<p>Naturally, finding a healthy balance between our technologies and our humanity is something that each of us must do on our own and within our families, friendships, organizations, and communities. For myself, I deliberately tilt toward more humanity, but it often feels like I'm swimming upstream...</p>

<h2><a href="1787.html">Keeping It Brief</a></h2>
<h3>2023-06-09</h3>
<p>Epicurus once said: "Understand that a long discourse and a short one both achieve the same result." Although that's standard advice for writers (Yevgeny Zamyatin counselled "writing with 90-proof ink"), few follow it. Many books could have been long articles, many long articles could have been blog posts, and many blog posts could have been aphorisms. My journal entries average around 400 words these days, and I limit my books to around 100 pages. This is simple respect for you, the reader. Besides, I'd rather provoke difficult questions than provide definitive answers, because only you can answer those questions for yourself, anyway. Perhaps loving wisdom involves respecting <em>your</em> wisdom as much as my own...</p>

<h2><a href="1786.html">Socrates and Thoreau Revisited</a></h2>
<h3>2023-06-09</h3>
<p>Last year around this time I posted a few thoughts on Socrates and Thoreau, specifically regarding the likely influence of a passage in Book VI of Plato's <cite>Republic</cite> on Thoreau's attitude toward mere professors of philosophy, who unlike true philosophers do not live according to the dictates of wisdom. The other day, while re-reading key passages in Plato's dialogues as part of my research on Aristotle, I suddenly realized that on the very next page in the 1804 edition of Plato's works that Thoreau borrowed from Emerson can be found the inspiration for Thoreau's attitude toward the news, best encapsulated in an aphorism from his essay <cite>Life Without Principle</cite>: "Read not the Times. Read the Eternities."</p>
<p>Here is the relevant passage from the <cite>Republic</cite>, in the translation that Thoreau would have read (Sydenham and Taylor 1804, p. 337):</p>
<blockquote>For somehow, Adimantus, the man at least who really applies his dianoëtic part to true being, has not leisure to look down to the little affairs of mankind, and, in fighting with them, to be filled with envy and ill nature; but, beholding and contemplating such objects as are orderly, and always subsist in the same manner, such as neither injure not are injured by each other, but are in all respects beautiful, and according to reason, these he imitates and resembles as far as possible; or, do you think it possible by any contrivance that a man not imitate that, in conversing with which he is filled with admiration?</blockquote>
<p>We can find significant echoes of these thoughts in <cite>Life Without Principle</cite>, such as:</p>
<blockquote>Not without a slight shudder at the danger, I often perceive how near I had come to admitting into my mind the details of some trivial affair -- the news of the street; and I am astonished to observe how willing men are to lumber their minds with such rubbish -- to permit idle rumors and incidents of the most insignificant kind to intrude on ground which should be sacred to thought. Shall the mind be a public arena, where the affairs of the street and the gossip of the tea-table chiefly are discussed? Or shall it be a quarter of heaven itself -- an hypaethral temple, consecrated to the service of the gods? I find it so difficult to dispose of the few facts which to me are significant, that I hesitate to burden my attention with those which are insignificant, which only a divine mind could illustrate. Such is, for the most part, the news in newspapers and conversation. It is important to preserve the mind's chastity in this respect.</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>If we have thus desecrated ourselves -- as who has not? -- the remedy will be by wariness and devotion to reconsecrate ourselves, and make once more a fane of the mind. We should treat our minds, that is, ourselves, as innocent and ingenuous children, whose guardians we are, and be careful what objects and what subjects we thrust on their attention. Read not the Times. Read the Eternities. Conventionalities are at length as bad as impurities. Even the facts of science may dust the mind by their dryness, unless they are in a sense effaced each morning, or rather rendered fertile by the dews of fresh and living truth. Knowledge does not come to us by details, but in flashes of light from heaven.</blockquote>
<p>Thus Thoreau, as Socrates two millennia before him, had a deeper purpose for avoiding trivialities: to model himself on the highest principles of what is sacred and beautiful and divine in human existence.</p>

<h2><a href="1785.html">George Winston, RIP</a></h2>
<h3>2023-06-07</h3>
<p>I was saddened yesterday to learn (via my friend Wayne Bethanis) that pianist-composer George Winston has died. Every solo performer of original music - not just pianists but guitarists and everyone else - owes him a debt of gratitude, for he was one of the few who blazed the trail of modern instrumental music, starting with his album <cite>Autumn</cite> in 1980. Although his music was often called "new age", he preferred the evocative term "rural folk piano". Many streams came together in his music: folk, blues, jazz, classical, rock, gospel, rhythm and blues, Hawaiian, and more. Yet he fused them into a seamless whole that was uniquely his own.</p>
<p>George Winston truly lived music as a way of life. Long ago I saw him perform at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City; in his flannel shirt and blue jeans and woolen socks, he was not dressed like a typical performer, but his utmost dedication to the music was evident from the first note to the last.</p>
<p>In my youth, I spent many, many hours listening to his albums <cite>Autumn</cite>, <cite>Winter Into Spring</cite>, and <cite>December</cite>, which were a significant influence on my own attempts at composing music for solo guitar; if I ever get around to recording these pieces, it will be in part to pay homage to the incomparable artistry of George Winston.</p>
