<h2><a href="1704.html">How Much Is Enough?</a></h2>
<h3>2022-03-06</h3>
<p>As mentioned in my post "Delphic Wisdom and Modern Science", on the walls of the ancient Greek temple at Delphi could be found the inscription μηδὲν ἄγαν, meaning "nothing too much". Yet how can one know how much is enough? Naturally it's hard to say precisely - after all, if it were easy, life wouldn't be so messy and complicated, now would it?</p>
<p>One clue comes a discussion of natural vs. unnatural wealth in Aristotle's <cite>Politics</cite> (Book I, Chapters 8 and 9). For Aristotle, natural wealth consists in the possessions necessary for life and useful for association in a community or household (in modern times we might also include corporations and charities). Here, the activity of acquisition has a natural limit determined by and subordinate to the purpose or telos of human life, especially what Aristotle calls living well or eudaimonia.</p>
<p>By contrast, unnatural wealth has lost its moorings in the purpose of human life and has taken on a life of its own. Here, acquisition becomes an end in itself and knows no limits. Thus it's impossible to say how much is enough: an individual or family or corporation or state keeps acquiring and acquiring for no greater or higher human purpose.</p>
<p>This same line of thinking applies to various other things that Aristotle calls external goods: not only wealth and possessions, but also power, reputation, social status, even friends (not to mention particular goods from kitchen gadgets to smartphone apps) can be acquired without regard to the aims of living a good human life. Yet he argued that this drive for acquisition does not lead to greater happiness or meaning in life, precisely because it is unlimited. As psychologists would say these days, the hedonic treadmill never ends. Thus it's better to step off the treadmill, educate your desires, and learn how to live well. Easier said than done, of course!</p>

<h2><a href="1703.html">Read the Eternities</a></h2>
<h3>2022-02-27</h3>
<p>One of my favorite Thoreau aphorisms goes like this: "Read not the Times; read the Eternities." Yet in times of turmoil - war, revolution, depression, pandemic, and the like - it can be difficult to focus on the timeless questions of how to live well because merely living take precedence. On the other hand, there's invariably something bad happening somewhere, and it's difficult to draw the line between what requires urgent attention and what is an ephemeral distraction or news-industry sensation.</p>
<p>Justifiably, in the last week all eyes have been on the reprehensible actions of an authoritarian thug whose conscript armies have invaded a neighboring country without provocation. Unfortunately, at some level turmoil is one of the eternities of human existence. How does one best manage oneself in such situations?</p>
<p>For the last eight years or more I've been on a low-information diet so that I can concentrate my energies where I can directly make a difference (family, friends, team, community, etc.). Even when major events occur in the world, I strictly limit how much attention I give them and instead try to think clearly about their fundamental causes (e.g., it might be time to re-read Thucydides' <cite>History</cite> or Eric Hoffer's <cite>True Believer</cite>) and their implications for how I should live. Although these implications might be eminently practical (e.g., stocking up on essential supplies, helping family and friends, volunteering in my community), I try not only to react but also to reflect and to act deliberately.</p>
<p>Not that I always manage myself perfectly - far from it. And let it be noted that after the Civil War broke out, Thoreau followed the news from the battlefront as closely as anyone else! Thus I'll end with two aphorisms of my own devising: although it's true that "there's no monopoly on hypocrisy", it's also true "you don't have to achieve an ideal to realize the benefits of idealism".</p>

<h2><a href="1702.html">A New Focus</a></h2>
<h3>2022-02-17</h3>
<p>After 25 years in the tech industry, I've decided it's time for a new focus in life. Last Friday was my last day at Mozilla, and my wife Elisa and I are already hard at work on a non-tech venture: a training program that we hope will help people develop professionally by applying the insights of psychological research and the great wisdom traditions to the challenges and opportunities of work and career.</p>
<p>Elisa and I have long wanted to work together and we're excited about what we each bring to this venture. After working in finance for many years, Elisa earned a PhD in industrial-organizational psychology, so she has deep knowledge of the scientific basis for flourishing at work. She's also taught subjects such as teamwork, theories of leadership, leadership development, challenges for first-time managers, causes of derailment, and organizational power and politics at the MBA level. She is also active as a professional business coach. Most recently she's explored the scholarly literature on positive psychology, a relatively young field that casts fresh light on the role of character strengths in personal success as well as best practices for happiness in general.</p>
<p>For myself, in parallel with my technology and business background, I've been studying the great philosophers my whole life. In the last few years I've concentrated primarily on Aristotle, whose virtue-based approach to ethics provides the most solid intellectual foundation for the study of character and human fulfillment. In addition, prior to my first job in technology I worked in training and instructional design, and my experience collaborating closely with customers and partners over the last ten years will likely come in handy when Elisa and I start working with companies and individuals.</p>
<p>Although it'll be a few months before we're ready to beta test our initial offering, I already have a growing list of people who want to participate, so drop me a line via email, LinkedIn, or Twitter if you might have an interest.</p>

<h2><a href="1701.html">Opinions, Expectations, and Emotions</a></h2>
<h3>2022-02-15</h3>
<p>Following up on my series of posts about the phenomenon of opinion, I've been pondering the relationship between opinions, expectations, and emotions.</p>
<p>It's well known that emotions are based on a conception of how things are or should be (as a simple example, one person might get excited by a Fourth of July fireworks display whereas another might find it offputting because they don't like crowds and loud noises). If my conception of things is, say, false or incomplete or misleading or just different from what the people around me believe, then it's quite possible that I might experience negative emotions.</p>
<p>I first explored these topics in my 2013 book <cite>Letters on Happiness: An Epicurean Dialogue</cite>. The ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus examined various dyads of emotion and misunderstanding; the classic Epicurean example is a misguided fear of death leading to a groundless desire for immortality, since both the fear and the desire are based on fundamental misconceptions about life and death. I then extended his analysis to a number of other emotions, such as desires for status, power, and fame.</p>
<p>Most directly for the topic at hand, I might be of the opinion that other people should behave in line with my expectations, but if they don't then I'll likely experience negative emotions such as surprise, disappointment, irritation, frustration, resentment, anger, or offense. Yet as I described in my post "Philosophy and Anger", this opinion is ill-founded.</p>
<p>Here we become aware that opinions are not a purely intellectual matter, but instead have real-world consequences for your day-to-day emotional state. Holding fewer opinions and holding opinions less strongly can lead to greater serenity in life, which is priceless.</p>

<h2><a href="1700.html">Meditations on Bach #10: Philosophy in Music</a></h2>
<h3>2022-02-10</h3>
<p>In the second edition of his extremely intriguing book <cite>Bach: The Fencing Master</cite>, cellist Anner Bylsma writes as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
Why did Bach write these Suites for violoncello without bass; for whom; and for which occasion? The second and last questions probably have to be answered: for himself. The first one: for all of us or for science - because these Suites are, without a doubt, a scientific work.<br><br>
Why did Bach write these Cello Suites? Take my word: for philosophy! A lot of explanation will be needed, but I am not even sure I will find a willing ear.<br><br>
Bach lived in the Age of Enlightenment, when people dressed up with enormous wigs, proud and happy to know that the working of their brains was more important than the doctrines of religion. Philosophy and logic are the basis of all knowledge in this period, rather than faith and its consequences. Precision in thinking and writing became of the utmost importance; think of Spinoza's Caute ('Precision').<br><br>
Bach's works are philosophy in music.
</blockquote>
<p>It's no surprise that Bylsma's speculations appeal to me (see my previous posts "Aristotle and Bach" and "Musical Monadology"). Perhaps my only quibble is with the opposition of philosophy and religion, because I suspect that Bach's God had a passion for order, coherence, and proportion.</p>
<p>We cannot prove these hypotheses only through writing and analysis, but must find the truth of them in the music itself. My explorations continue...</p>

<h2><a href="1699.html">Jealousy and Envy</a></h2>
<h3>2022-02-10</h3>
<p>A friend recently asked me how I would characterize the difference between jealousy and envy. Here's how I see it: jealousy is when I want to gain something you have, and envy is when I want you to lose something you have. If I'm jealous of your new Tesla, I want a Tesla too. If I'm envious of the superyacht that Jeff Bezos is building, I don't want him to have that yacht even if I'll never be able to have such a thing.</p>
<p>There's a murky zone involving "rivalrous goods" that only one of us can possess. The classic case is love: if both you and I want to be married to the same person, in most cultures only one of us can win. The same could be true of promotions at work, political appointments, and the like. One way to look at these cases is to say that jealousy and envy overlap or that I'm feeling both jealousy and envy.</p>
<p>Because jealousy has a positive component (I want X) whereas envy seems purely negative (I don't want you to have Y), it strikes me that the remedies differ. When I feel jealousy, I can educate and temper my acquisitive desires to not want X (do I really "need" that shiny new Tesla?). When I feel envy, I can do a better job of accepting the good fortune of other people - even if it is excessive or undeserved (naturally, this can be especially hard to swallow!).</p>
<p>I'll end with my translation of a quote from Epicurus (Vatican Sayings #53):</p>
<blockquote>Envy no one. For good people do not deserve envy, and the more that wicked people succeed the more they ruin things for themselves.</blockquote>
