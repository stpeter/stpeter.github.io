<h2><a href="1772.html">Intelligence vs. Wisdom</a></h2>
<h3>2023-03-17</h3>
<p>Ever since I left behind the high arrogance of my teenage years, I have valued wisdom over intelligence. This is likely why I'm much more drawn to the ancient conception of philosophy as a way of life than to the modern conception of philosophy as an exercise in argumentation.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the criteria that Colin McGinn associates with those who are best at the activity or skill of what's known as doing philosophy: "cleverness, ingenuity, argumentative power, intellectual penetration, insight, polemical punch, sheer philosophical IQ" along with being "so sharp, so intellectually resourceful, so outright brilliant (outrageously so)."</p>
<p>That's all fine for the modern-day sophists who inhabit academia, but I'm not impressed. As I see it, the purpose of philosophical knowledge is not intellectual jousting, but living well. That's why philosophy in its original sense meant the love and practice of wisdom.</p>
<p>Now, I happen to think that exposing yourself to the great philosophical thinkers and traditions helps you to succeed more fully at the task of living a complete human life. Yet one needn't study philosophy in order to attain a fair measure of wisdom: instead, you need to have some experience of life, reflect on that experience, and use the resulting insights to guide your choices and commitments. But perhaps that's too democratic for elitist philosophical experts, eh?</p>
<p>Based on the aforementioned criteria, Colin McGinn has also argued that the greatest philosopher in history is none other than ... Colin McGinn! In the comments section to the post where he makes that claim (perhaps somewhat tongue-in-cheek), he states flat-out that "Philosophy is not a practice (ethical disposition); it's an intellectual subject." If that is so, then perhaps doing philosophy has nothing to do with living a good human life.</p> 
<p>Although these two viewpoints might seem to be worlds apart, I think we might be able to find a middle ground. After all, at least a few of the great philosophers have remained aware of the practical importance of wisdom while pursuing foundational insights in philosophical theory. In that rarified group I'd include the likes of Plato, Aristotle, Chuang Tzu, Spinoza, J.S. Mill, William James, and George Santayana. How did they do it? That's a subject for another post...</p>

<h2><a href="1771.html">Information is Overrated</a></h2>
<h3>2023-03-09</h3>
<p>It's said that we live in the Information Age. Yet what is the purpose of information? I see at least three possibilities...</p>
<p>First, information can make our decision more effective, especially regarding threats and opportunities. Is that sound in the forest a predator from which I should flee? Is this fruit edible? Does this potential mate find me attractive? If I click this like button, will my friends disapprove? That kind of thing.</p>
<p>Yet it strikes me that these days we often consume information in such a mindless way that it moves us to make unnecessarily frequent decisions, or at least to think that we need to. As an example, I follow an investing approach called the permanent portfolio, which requires rebalancing only once every few years; however, if I followed the financial press I might feel the need to make frequent investing decisions (most of which would be driven by fear or greed). Similarly, I eat a balanced diet containing lots of fruits and vegetables, but if I paid close attention to health news I might feel the need to reguarly modify my diet so as to include the latest fad foods. And these areas are fairly objective because they're based on needs for health and wealth: don't get me started on information about celebrities, athletes, politicians, and other such personalities.</p>
<p>Second, closely related to information as an input to a decision is information as a trigger for emotion. If a work colleague tells me that layoffs are imminent, I might get worried that I'm about to lose my job. If a friend shares a cutesy cat video, I might experience a shot of happy feelings. If everyone I know is worked up about the latest crime spree, police violence, or international incident, I might get worked up, too.</p>
<p>Just as our obsessive consumption of information leads to excessive motion in the realm of decision, so also it leads to excessive motion (literally, e-motion) in realm of feeling. We are always reacting: sometimes overjoyed but more often hopping mad, downtrodden, grieving, depressed, restlessly anxious. By filling our heads with information, we have lost our heads.</p>
<p>A third purpose for information might be to help us craft our views about the world, even if no immediate decisions or emotions are involved. Following the familiar <em>scala scientia</em>, information might help us gain knowledge, and knowledge might help us gain wisdom. For instance: what would it say about society or human nature if Putin succeeds in his bloodthirsty, maniacal destruction of a free and independent Ukraine?</p>
<p>Well, it's a bad situation over there, but how much can we really come to <em>know</em> by seeking information about every twist and turn of the Russian invasion? It seems to me that we're not learning all that much which is new. Better, I think, to familiarize ourselves with the long tradition of Russian autocracy or, even deeper, the social and historical insights of Thucydides. From that direction lies knowledge and wisdom - not from the ceaseless, breathless chatter of events, events, events.</p>
<p>Thus along these three dimensions - action, reaction, knowledge - I see few benefits and many costs from immersing ourselves in the flood of information to which we are all exposed these days. Information is overrated.</p>

<h2><a href="1770.html">Counter-Cultural Contemplation</a></h2>
<h3>2023-03-02</h3>
<p>We live in a culture that glorifies action, busy-ness, and constant activity. "Don't just stand there, do something." "Idle hands are the devil's workshop." "Pull your head out of the clouds." "Get real." "Think globally, act locally." "Knowledge is power."</p>
<p>This attitude has even bled into philosophy, that most abstract of humanistic disciplines. It was Francis Bacon (1561-1626) who first insisted that knowledge is power. Philosophy as political activism is a more recent invention; we can perhaps date it to 1845, the year in which Karl Marx proclaimed that "Philosophers have hitherto only <em>interpreted</em> the world in various ways; the point is to <em>change</em> it." Yet Marx, who wrote his doctoral dissertation on the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, should have known better. As Pierre Hadot has explained, in ancient times the purpose of philosophy as a way of life was never merely to interpret the world, and certainly not primarily to change it, but to <em>change oneself</em>.</p>
<p>"Be the change you want to see." That sounds like another form of activism, doesn't it? But what if the change you pursue is to withdraw from the hustle-bustle of activism in all its forms and instead to use your leisure time for the serious purpose of inquiry, awareness, and deep understanding of the causes of things?</p>
<p>In the context of 21st century society, could the <em>vita contemplativa</em> be the ultimate counter-culture and perhaps even a threat to those in authority, since it fundamentally repudiates the avaricious acquisition of power, wealth, status, and fame?</p>
<p>Something to ponder...</p>

<h2><a href="1769.html">Aristotle on States of Character</a></h2>
<h3>2023-02-23</h3>
<p>One of the distinctive features of Aristotle's philosophy of human affairs is his analysis of the various states of character, of which he identifies at least four: the corrupted person, the unrestrained person, the self-restrained person, and the good person. I might describe them briefly as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The thoroughly corrupted person (i.e., the μοχθηρός) has no knowledge of the beautifully right and fully human way to live, and therefore consistently indulges in ignoble actions and feelings according to momentary desires. Therefore this person lacks knowledge and doesn't act or feel aright in many or most circumstances.</li>
<li>The unrestrained person (i.e., the ἀκρατής) has knowledge of the beautifully right and fully human way to live, but that knowledge can be overruled by momentary desires to indulge in ignoble actions and feelings. Therefore this person has knowledge but doesn't always act and feel aright in certain circumstances, and thus doesn't experience inner harmony.</li>
<li>The self-restrained person (i.e., the ἐγκρατής) has knowledge of the beautifully right and fully human way to live, and uses that knowledge to override momentary desires to indulge in ignoble actions and feelings. Therefore this person has knowledge and acts aright in the end but doesn't always feel aright, and thus doesn't always experience inner harmony.</li>
<li>The thoroughly excellent person who takes life seriously (i.e., the σπουδαῖος) has knowledge of the beautifully right and fully human way to live, and also has a settled desire to consistently apply that knowledge in actions and feelings. Therefore this person has knowledge, acts aright, feels aright, and experiences inner harmony.</li>
</ol>
<p>Two points here are potentially confusing.</p>
<p>First, these states are not all or nothing. We're all familiar with people who might be unrestrained in one respect (say, they have a gambling problem) but who behave in acceptable ways in other aspects or domains of life. Although Aristotle mentions this nuance a few times, he doesn't talk about it in great detail (perhaps because he's interested in understanding the nature of the character states, not in judging individual people).</p>
<p>Second, when we describe these states of character in terms of knowledge and desire, we might infer that there is an inherent conflict between reason and emotion. However, that's not accurate, for two reasons: knowledge too involves yearning (for "all human beings yearn to know") and a wholehearted commitment to the beautifully right and fully human way to live is a seamless combination of yearning and thinking (for "commitment is either desiderative deliberation or deliberative desire").</p>
<p>Finally, what about this concept of "the beautifully right and fully human way to live"? Isn't that antithetical to pluralism about values? Well, maybe, but that's a large topic for a future post or my forthcoming book on Aristotle...</p>

<h2><a href="1768.html">I Get Around</a></h2>
<h3>2023-02-18</h3>
<p>As a brief addendum to my post about digital moderation, I'll mention another longtime habit of mine: analog wayfinding. I have never used automated navigation systems like GPS; instead, if I'm going someplace new I look at a map beforehand and commit the route to memory. (For example, last year I drove from Camden, Maine to Ottawa, Canada in this way.) It helps that my spatial memory is strong: I seem to keep a schematic picture of the route in my head so that I can essentially walk through the whole thing and recall the necessary decision points when I come to an intersection. In addition, I have a general idea of my interim destinations (e.g., towns I need to pass through or roads I need to drive on), so if I go off course I have an intuitive sense of how to correct the situation. Yes, occasionally I get slightly lost, but I always pretty much know where I am. Give it a try sometime! :-)</p>

<h2><a href="1767.html">Of Cigarettes and Smartphones</a></h2>
<h3>2023-02-16</h3>
<p>Have you ever watched an old movie from perhaps 75 years ago in which it seems that everyone was smoking cigarettes? We - who are, of course, far wiser - shake our heads at their benighted behavior because we recognize the horrendous health effects of smoking.</p>
<p>But have you ever wondered what folks 75 years from today might look back on with similar feelings regarding the benighted behaviors we exhibit nowadays? Might they perhaps home in on our compulsive use of smartphones?</p>
<p>Having just read Cal Newport's book <cite>Digital Minimalism</cite>, these questions are top of mind for me. Over the years I have progressively cut back on smartphone usage: I've deleted social media apps (I quit Twitter in 2016 but removed their mobile app years before that), I've disabled sounds and badges and other notifications, I've switched my phone colors to greyscale to make the interface less stimulating, etc. And now that I've left the tech industry, I am blessedly free of constant meeting reminders, hundreds of email messages a day, and above all Slack. Yet still the stupid phone beckons: hey, I could check for recent email, see if a friend has texted me, reload a news app (my favorite is Otherweb), and so on.</p>
<p>As Newport sees it, the problem is not only that the smartphone and related technologies are designed to pull us in, but that we don't have a <em>philosophy</em> of how they ought to fit into our lives. Moreover, we don't take our precious time and attention as seriously as we ought to; thus we find it all too easy to get sucked into endlessly distracting apps, superficial online "connection" via like buttons, and mindless information consumption. This pulls us away from what truly matters: deep learning, human conversation, and meaningful value-creation.</p>
<p>Although I don't actually spend all that much time on my phone, I appreciated Newport's call for digital minimalism (in good Aristotelian fashion, I might prefer to label it digital <em>moderation</em>). As a result of reading his book, I'll be making some further changes to my technology usage, such as checking email and messaging apps less frequently, perhaps deleting my mobile email app so that I send and receive email only on my laptop, and even looking into a minimalist phone like the Mudita Pure.</p>
<p>If I identify any helpful tools or insights, I'll post about them here in the future.</p>
