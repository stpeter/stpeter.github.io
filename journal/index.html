<h2><a href="1751.html">Effective Altruism and Ineffective Egoism</a></h2>
<h3>2022-12-08</h3>
<p>The collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire at FTX and Alameda Research has cast a shadow over the "effective altruism" movement, of which he was a major financer. Ironically, I would argue that in the end he failed at altruism because he was an ineffective egoist!</p>
<p>Consider the utter mess he's made of his life: his company destroyed, his reputation ruined, his relationships in tatters, his future decidedly uncertain (he might be facing jail time), etc. Beyond and before these external goods, consider also what the ancients called goods of the soul: his lack of integrity, self-regulation, moderation, humility, good judgment, and other essential excellences of character.</p>
<p>Now, I think that drawing too sharp a distinction between egoism and altruism is an example of creating a false dichotomy, since the two phenomena tend to merge in any truly healthy marriage, friendship, team, or community. Indeed, SBF missed the mark (to put it mildly!) with regard to both enlightened self-interest and philanthropic benevolence.</p>
<p>Sadly, the rot goes much deeper than any one person. In <cite>What We Owe to the Future</cite>, the philosophic manifesto of the effective altruism movement, William MacAskill has put forth a position he calls longtermism, which at root is utilitarianism projected forward in time. What struck me most about MacAskill's book is precisely that he too lacks a clear and complete conception of human flourishing (more on that in another post). Yet having a deep understanding of living well is the only sustainable foundation for helping ourselves and helping others, both in the far future and in the here and now.</p>
<p>Thus step one is to get our intellectual house in order and truly know ourselves as human beings. Thankfully, the required insights can be found throughout the great wisdom traditions. To paraphrase Isaac Newton, all we really need to do is polish the stones we find on the shores of the great ocean of truth. On the other hand, living up to these ideals might be slightly more challenging...</p>

<h2><a href="1750.html">The Mathematics of Freedom</a></h2>
<h3>2022-12-02</h3>
<p>While reading about the recent protests in China against the government's Zero Covid policy (and, more generally, the totalitarian surveillance state established by the Chinese Communist Party), I was reminded of a fascinating quote from logician Kurt Gödel extending the results of his Incompleteness Theorem to matters of society and governance:</p>
<blockquote>A completely unfree society (i.e., one proceeding in everything by strict rules of "conformity") will, in its behavior, be either inconsistent or incomplete, i.e., unable to solve certain problems, perhaps of vital importance. Both, of course, may jeopardize its survival in a difficult situation. A similar remark would also apply to individual human beings.</blockquote>
<p>It strikes me that the CCP is running up against some of these problems of vital importance. They are certain that they have discovered all the truths of human society, that human experience is finite and exhaustible, that they can solve all problems through the pseudo-scientific formalisms of dialectical materialism and Marxist-Leninist-Maoist theory.</p>
<p>Yet the Russian novelist Yevgeny Zamyatin identified the fallacies of such thinking as far back as the 1920s:</p>
<blockquote>Fortunately, all truths are erroneous. This is the very essence of the dialectical process: today's truths become errors tomorrow; there is no final number. This truth (the only one) is for the strong alone. Weak-nerved minds insist on a finite universe, a last number; they need, in Nietzsche's words, "the crutches of certainty." The weak-nerved lack the strength to include themselves in the dialectical syllogism.</blockquote>
<p>Although we might think of mathematics as cold and forbidding, Gödel and Zamyatin perceived a connection between mathematics and humanity: both are incompletable and inexhaustible; they cannot be utterly formalized under a fully consistent and complete set of rigid rules; there is no final truth, no final certainty, no final number; freedom is an inherent condition of every human activity, even mathematics.</p>
<p>Is there a certain cosmic justice in the fact that some Chinese students held up printouts of the Friedmann ("freed-man") equation while speaking out against totalitarian tyranny? Perhaps more than they know...</p>

<h2><a href="1749.html">Can a Nietzschean Be a Feminist?</a></h2>
<h3>2022-12-01</h3>
<p>In one of my earliest blog posts (written in 1996!), I explained why I'm a female chauvinist. This attitude can be hard to square with my mostly positive perspective on Friedrich Nietzsche, which I explored in my book <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite>. After all, Nietzsche is notorious for spewing vitriol and venom regarding the role of women in modern society. Unfortunately, this is something that his admirers often prefer to sweep under the rug.</p>
<p>One worthy exception is Hedwig Dohm (1831-1919), an early activist for women's rights in Germany and an eminently clear thinker all on her own. In Dohm's essay "Nietzsche and Women", she masterfully rebuts and refutes Nietzsche point by point, using his own words and ideas to expose his ignorance and inconsistencies. As one example, she observes that Nietzsche's blathering about women belonging in a harem would bring us not one step closer to producing the Übermensch of his dreams.</p>
<p>Yet rather than condemn Nietzsche entirely, Dohm takes inspiration toward a kind of Nietzschean feminism from hints of a more constructive conception in his writings, such as §74 of <cite>The Joyful Wisdom</cite>: "A deep and powerful alto voice ... suddenly raises the curtain upon possibilities that we usually do not believe in. All at once we believe that somewhere in the world there could be women with lofty, heroic, royal souls, capable of and ready for mastery over men, because in them the best of man aside from his sex has become an incarnate ideal."</p>
<p>Although Dohm does not put it this way, Nietzsche the great classicist should have known that this vision was not merely potential but actual. What of Aspasia of Miletus, advisor to Pericles and teacher to Socrates? What of Hypatia of Alexandria, mathematician, astronomer, and Neoplatonic philosopher? In post-classical times, what of Heloise, who held her own intellectually with Abelard? What of Queen Christina of Sweden, who engaged in philosophical correspondence with the likes of Gassendi and Descartes? What of George Eliot, who completed the first translation into English of Spinoza's <cite>Ethics</cite>? And so on.</p>
<p>In the end, Dohm recognizes that Nietzsche was quite simply blind (willfully or not) regarding the highest potential of women, and quotes §226 of <cite>Daybreak</cite> to good effect: "Even great spirits have only their five-fingers' breadth of experience; just beyond it their thinking ceases and their endless empty space and stupidity begins."</p>
<p>Dohm's essay is well worth reading in its entirety, and can be found in <cite>Women Philosophers in the Long Nineteenth Century</cite>, edited by Dalia Nassar and Kristin Gjesdal.</p>

<h2><a href="1748.html">RFC 9325: TLS Recommendations</a></h2>
<h3>2022-11-30</h3>
<p>Back in 2015, I co-authored an IETF specification (RFC 7525) describing best practices for the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) on the Internet. Much has happened since then: new security vulnerabilities, new deployment scenarios, and especially a new version of the TLS protocol (RFC 8446, published in August 2018). Thus it was time for us to define updated recommendations, which Yaron Sheffer, Thomas Fossati, and I have just done in RFC 9325. For more detailed information about the changes we made, take a few minutes to read Yaron's blog post.</p>

<h2><a href="1747.html">What Is the Job of a News Story?</a></h2>
<h3>2022-11-29</h3>
<p>Over the last few months I've blatantly but deliberately gone off my low-information diet - not because I suddenly feel a need to be highly informed, but because I'm advising Otherweb, a startup that aims to fix the world's information ecosystem by presenting only those news stories that are provably lacking in sensationalistic language, partisan fervor, and other manipulative techniques. (Check it out!)</p>
<p>As a result, it's no surprise that I've been pondering the very point of the news. Or, as management thinker Clayton Christiansen would have put it: what's the job of a news story?</p>
<p>First, consider that there's such a thing as the news <em>industry</em>. No matter whether there's <em>really</em> anything important happening, the newspaper must be published, the TV or radio show must be broadcast, etc. This implies that at least some of the news has to be manufactured or at least heavily massaged.</p>
<p>Second, a news outlet doesn't make money by being especially informative, but by selling advertisements (and to a lesser extent garnering subscriptions or in some cases grants and donations). The more that people pay attention to a news outlet, the more valuable its ad space becomes. Thus a news outlet has strong incentives to grab and hold your attention by any means possible. (Although this has gotten worse in the Internet era because each news story can be individually measured for performance, the same underlying incentives have long been there.)</p>
<p>Third, advertisements exist because companies have products to sell. There wasn't much if any advertising 200 years ago because people made most of what they needed at home or could source it in their local community.</p>
<p>By combining these three insights, we can see that the job of a news story is not to inform you, not to be accurate, and not to be true, but to do its part in convincing you to buy stuff.</p>
<p>But wait, it gets worse! A single news story does not have its own life to live, but needs to do its part in continually drawing you back to the news outlet where it originated. It does this by helping to keep you in a state of constant agitation about what might happen next. Cultivating emotions like fear, anger, and greed is not a secondary effect of the news, but one of its primary reasons for being. And if there is no crisis, we'd better invent one. (The end of democracy! Ecological catastrophe! Civil war! Civilizational collapse!)</p>
<p>This leads to a further insight about how the sausage gets made. Having worked in organizations that felt the need to manufacture news stories, I can shed a small ray of light on the matter. Consider a seemingly innocuous story about the latest medical research result - say, a study of sleep patterns. The importance of getting a good night's sleep is a truism, so it's not news. But the researchers need a continual stream of grant money, the medical school's PR people get measured on "impact" in their performance appraisals, big financial donors want to be recognized, etc. Thus when the researcher's paper is published in a medical journal, a news story about the findings gets created, with a catchy headline like "Your Sleep Patterns Could Be Killing You - Here's Why!" Thousands of people, motivated by the ever-present fear of death, click the link and everyone in the news-creation "supply chain" is happy.</p>
<p>Now multiply this scenario by thousands and thousands of news sources: companies with products to sell, authors with books to promote, financiers with profits to pocket, universities with brands to burnish, celebrities with famous names to maintain, influencers with followers to amass, non-profit organizations with an imperative to survive, ideologues with axes to grind, government agencies with budgets to increase, lobbyists and pollsters with clients to please, politicians with power to gain, and all the rest.</p>
<p>But aren't professional journalists of high integrity and superior objectivity supposed to protect the citizenry from these malign influences? I won't even deign to answer that one!</p>
<p>The somewhat cynical conclusion I draw is that much of we read and see and hear is mental junk food that's extruded out of a vast array of self-interested news machines, designed to manipulate our opinions and emotions, and marketed to us as informative yet providing minimal nutritional value.</p>
<p>These days as I read the news, I keep asking one question: "Hey little story, what's your job?" The answers can be illuminating.</p>

<h2><a href="1746.html">Political Moderation</a></h2>
<h3>2022-11-23</h3>
<p>Here in America we've survived another national election (yet again the most momentous in our history!), so following up on my post last week about moderation it seems timely to offer a few reflections on political and ideological moderation.</p>
<p>Having been a dogmatic libertarian earlier in my life, I well understand the allure of political immoderation: the pride of having all the answers, the intellectual gratification of complete consistency and absolute certainty, the beautiful devotion to a moral ideal, the self-transcendence of being part of a movement that aims to change the world, the feeling of superiority over those who lack our special insights, the peculiar pleasure that accompanies righteous anger, and all the rest.</p>
<p>I also understand the deep historical roots of American extremism, given the founder effect of the religious zealots, avaricious adventurers, and other crazy Englishmen who four hundred years ago crossed the stormy North Atlantic in creaky boats to settle a howling wilderness - followed by a continuous stream of risk-takers and borderline fanatics ever since.</p>
<p>So I get it, I really do.</p>
<p>But - and this is perhaps the biggest "but" in human society - <em>utopia is not an option</em>. If I am two or three standard deviations beyond the median voter in my allegiance to progressivism or populism or environmentalism or libertarianism or religious fundamentalism or any other ism, then in a pluralistic society like modern-day America my viewpoint will never be triumphant unless the movement I'm a part of brings significant force to bear against the freedom of thought and action of those we disagree with or whose way of life we dislike. Maybe I believe that such a use of force is morally justified; maybe I believe (with Lenin) that "you can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs"; maybe I believe it's not really force if I outsource it to government bureaucracies or big corporations or social media mobs. But my self-deception shouldn't mean the rest of you need to be infected by the disease of my extremism.</p>
<p>Average folks (those mythical median voters) aren't extremists. They want good governance, basic competence among public servants, a lack of waste and corruption, respect for the citizenry, decent schools, low crime, public order, stable prices, peaceful transfers of power, and the like. Extremists often have disdain for such "bourgeois" concerns, but they are blind to the fact that "little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism, but peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice" (Adam Smith, <cite>The Wealth of Nations</cite>).</p>
<p>How does one become more moderate, politically or otherwise? The advice Aristotle gave in Book 2 of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> might be relevant:</p>
<blockquote>We must consider the things towards which we ourselves also are easily carried away; for some of us tend to one thing, some to another; and this will be recognizable from the pleasure and the pain we feel. We must drag ourselves away to the contrary extreme; for we shall get into the intermediate state by drawing well away from error, as people do in straightening sticks that are bent.</blockquote>
<p>But this is hard, because if I tend toward an extreme then dragging myself away toward the opposite extreme will feel like compromising with an unalloyed evil. In my experience it's easier to open myself to a wide range of perspectives (e.g., by reading widely in multiple disciplines, preferably from non-partisan sources) and then let those perspectives percolate in my brain for a while. Naturally, this means I need to spend less time reading people I agree with; this is a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>Another activity I find especially helpful is to look seriously at how my preferred ideas and policies have been applied in the real world - and reflect on whether the evidence indicates success or failure in relation to human flourishing. This seems to be what led to changes in my thinking about intellectual property rights some twenty years ago, based on my experience in the open-source software community. A more recent example is marijuana decriminalization, about which I'm on the fence: free-market economic theory predicts that legalization would cause the black market to collapse, but apparently that hasn't happened, to deleterious effect here in Colorado and elsewhere (see a recent analysis entitled "Marijuana's Black Market 2.0" at City Journal). In a similar vein, my environmentalist friends might be interested in how Finland's Green Party committed to nuclear power as a way of reducing CO2 emissions. Examples could be multiplied many times over.</p>
<p>As with personal moderation, political moderation might seem to lack the excitement of Nietzsche's living dangerously. Yet more and more I've come to realize that radicalism is overrated, and to appreciate the value of a principled incrementalism.</p>
