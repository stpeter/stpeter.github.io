<h2><a href="1688.html">Questions and Answers</a></h2>
<h3>2021-12-29</h3>
<p>Consider the following statements... "There are no answers, only questions." "Life is all about the journey, not the destination." "A teacher or a counselor should encourage dialogue, not provide direction." All true as far as they go. And yet.</p>
<p>Life is finite. There is no escaping the necessity for answers and destinations and directions, even if in some sense they are never final but only provisional. If you ask the love of your life for an answer to the question "Will you marry me?" then presumably you don't want to hear that there are no answers, only questions! Any journey worthy of the name consists of a series of interim destinations, not completely random wanderings. Dialogue is delightful, but at its most constructive it results in realizations - often inspired by directions that a person or a book suggests - enabling you to make decisions about your future.</p>
<p>Here as always there is a balance to be struck.</p>
<p>On the one hand, if you're merely handed the answers or informed of your destination or told what direction to go in, then you're not truly learning or building the skills you must acquire in order to live well. On the other hand, a genuinely wise person knows that some answers and destinations and directions are better than others, and strives to help others avoid the brambles and stay on a path to flourishing and fulfillment.</p>
<p>And here as always it's finding the beautifully right balance that is the greatest challenge. As Spinoza says at the very end of his <cite>Ethics</cite>, "all things excellent are as difficult as they are rare."</p>

<h2><a href="1686.html">Weekly Wisdom</a></h2>
<h3>2021-12-27</h3>
<p>Although I don't make New Year's resolutions, at this time of year I do tend to reconsider some of my goals and practices. One thing I'd like to improve on is the frequency of entries in my online journal, because writing them pushes me to think about how I'm living and what I'm learning. Thus going forward I'll strive to post such reflections at least once a week - most likely on Friday evenings or over the weekend, when it's easier to find time for reflection.

<h2><a href="1685.html">Meditations on Bach #9: Musical Monadology</a></h2>
<h3>2021-12-26</h3>
<p>In meditation #7 of this series, I took note of some similarities between the aesthetics of Aristotle and the music of Bach. Another intriguing influence might be the monadology of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716), who directly influenced philosophers and musical theorists in the Bach's orbit: for instance, Bach's student Lorenz Mizler (1711-1778) was a follower of the Leibniz scholar Christian Wolff (1679-1754). In chapter 5 of his book <cite>Music in the Culture of the Renassiance and Other Essays</cite>, Edward Lowinsky makes the following observations:</p>
<blockquote>The surging melody conceals the motivic form of the substructure. This motivic form is one of the essential aspects of Bach's musical organism. The prototype of Bach's music, the fugue, reveals the relationship between the part and whole, the fugal subject and the fugal form.... [E]ven in the free form of the prelude, the closest relationship exists between the smallest part and the whole.... But we might be closest to the truth if we say that the whole and the parts, including the smallest elements, the motives, are inseparable and are in constant musical influence upon each other. Bach's music may be viewed as a perfect symbol of the universe as seen by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, a universe formed by Monads, which are defined as simple, individuated, energetic substances in a constant flx of activity and change, related to other Monads through a preestablished harmony. In this picture of the universe the Monad stands for the motive, the preestablished harmony for the vision of the whole. A Bach motive can indeed be defined in terms of a Leibniz Monad, whose main attribute is force and energy; it is constantly active and variable, but in the nature of its action and change it follows its own inner principle; the Monad is a mirror of the whole, even as the whole consists of the Monads. Yet, each Monad mirrors the whole, the universe, in its own individual fashion, so that the immense order and harmony of the universe is accompanied by infinite variety. In a Bach fugue we find the most perfect order together with the greatest possible variety. The fugal subject is as once identical throughout and variable throughout. It appears in constantly varying pitches, keys, shapes, time forms, and directions. Yet, it never loses its identity.</blockquote>
<p>This notion of unity in variety is what Bach and his followers called musical perfection. It is well summarized by John Butt in his paper "'A mind unconscious that it is calculating?' Bach and the rationalist philosophy of Wolff, Leibniz, and Spinoza", published in <cite>The Cambridge Companion to Bach</cite>, p. 64:</p>
<blockquote>The formula he [Leibniz] offers in the <cite>Monadology</cite> (1714) for God's creative strategy may well work as an ideal summary of Bach's approach to composition: "[the differing] perspectives of a single universe in accordance with the different points of view of each monad ... is the means of obtaining as much variety as possible; that is to say, it is the means of obtaining as much perfection as possible" (<cite>Monadology</cite>, paragraphs 57-8).</blockquote>
<p>As far as I can see (or hear!) this is not idle speculation, since it plays out in every measure of Bach's music.  Laurence Dreyfus plumbs the depths of these matters, albeit at a purely musical level (leaving aside all philosophical speculation), in his book <cite>Bach and the Patterns of Invention</cite>. In future meditations I'll have more to say about those patterns of invention specifically within the Bach Cello Suites.</p>
<p>P.S. It might not be accidental that this is post #1685 in my online journal, since Bach was born in the year 1685...</p>

<h2><a href="1684.html">A Friend by Any Other Name</a></h2>
<h3>2021-12-19</h3>
<p>It is said that when the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus died, he left behind thousands of friends. This was 2300 years before Facebook, so how could he have befriended so many people?</p>
<p>I suspect that most of them were not dear friends (it's impossible to be close to that many people) but instead students or followers; yet he seems to have referred to them as friends because friendship or œÜŒπŒªŒØŒ± was core to his philosophy of life. Perhaps also he did not differentiate strongly between the teacher-student relationship and the friend-friend relationship. See for example the very end of his <cite>Letter to Menoikeus</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>So practice these and similar things day and night, by yourself and with a like-minded friend, and you will never be disturbed whether waking or sleeping, and you will live as a god among men: for a man who lives in the midst of immortal goods is unlike a merely mortal being.</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, we find something similar in the Confucian tradition. Consider this quote from Book VII of the <cite>Analects</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>The Master said, "When I walk along with two others, they may serve me as my teachers. I will select their good qualities and follow them, their bad qualities and avoid them."</blockquote>
<p>The Neo-Confucians held similar views; a good example is Wu Yubi, a Confucian teacher who lived in the 1400s (cf. M. Theresa Kelleher, <cite>The Journal of Wu Yubi</cite>, p. 156).</p>
<p>For some months I've been pondering the many pairs of terms we use for relationships that can involve ethical or psychological authority: therapist-patient, counselor-client, teacher-student, mentor-youth, coach-protege, minister-layman, priest-parishioner, prophet-disciple, guru-seeker, guide-traveller, leader-follower, expert-beginner, parent-child, etc. In the recent tradition of philosophical counseling, certain providers try to avoid such terms entirely; for instance, Gerd Achenbach, who started a philosophical practice at K√∂ln Germany way back in 1981, says that he is merely a host and the people who visit him are his guests. This is broadly consistent with the "philosophical midwifery" that Socrates practiced - for he, too, called his interlocutors friends, not students, disciples, followers, patients, or clients.</p>
<p>Naturally, it's one thing to use neutral, non-authoritarian terminology, and perhaps quite another to foster an egalitarian relationship or environment between two people when one of them might be considered more knowledgeable or experienced. For instance, the latter is decidedly my intent when I mentor people; although I think that I mostly succeed, I can't be certain that I always do...</p>

<h2><a href="1683.html">Aristotle Research Report #17: Let the Re-Reading Begin</a></h2>
<h3>2021-11-28</h3>
<p>Just under two years ago, I thought I was done with phase one of my research into Aristotle's views on human flourishing, having at that point read around 120 distinct works by or related to Aristotle (including all of Plato's dialogues). Well, I was wrong: since then I've read an additional 150 works, almost exclusively in the scholarly literature on Aristotle. Now I have three whole shelves of books about Aristotle in my office.</p>
<p><img src="/images/aristotle-1a.jpg"></p>
<p>At this point I'm finally ready to begin the process of re-reading - or, to be precise, going over the many passages that I've marked up in these works, organizing the material along topical lines, identifying key themes, and coming to conclusions about the nature and value of Aristotle's insights. But first I think I'll take a break for a few months!</p>
