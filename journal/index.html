<h2><a href="1728.html">Controversies</a></h2>
<h3>2022-08-04</h3>
<p>While reading the autobiography of Charles Darwin a few weeks ago, I came across the following passage:</p>
<blockquote>I rejoice that I have avoided controversies, and this I owe to [Charles] Lyell, who many years ago, in reference to my geological works, strongly advised me never to get entangled in a controversy, as it rarely did any good and caused a miserable loss of time and temper.</blockquote>
<p>This passage is slightly ironic, because no scientific work has been more controversial over the last 175 years than Darwin's theory of evolution. Clearly, Darwin did not shy away from explosive topics, so what did he mean by avoiding controversies?</p>
<p>A peek at my trusty 1828 edition of Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language yielded a definition I immediately fell in love with: a controversy is "an agitation of contrary opinions" (similar, perhaps, to a murder of crows or an exaltation of larks, as I explored long ago in my nonsense poem "The Problem of the One and the Many").</p>
<p>Because I said quite enough on the subject of opinions in a series of blog posts last year, today I'd like to think about the agitation aspect.</p>
<p>Agitation implies a number of phenomena, all negative: a violent stirring of emotions, a tumultuous confusion of voices, a disorderly mob of opposing groups, and the like. In the agitation of contrary opinions, there are two primary vicitms:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The reasonable weighing of evidence and insights in pursuit of truth and wisdom.</li>
  <li>All feelings of calm, tranquility, and serenity (as Darwin put it: "a miserable loss of [good] temper").</li>
</ol>
<p>Sadly, we all seem to be in a state of constant agitation these days, tossed about in a neverending battle of in-groups vs. out-groups in which we're nearly forced to take one side or the other side. But only nearly: each of us can decide to step outside the fray, to go beyond binary allegiances, to focus on the eternities, to never get entangled in the deafening controversies that keep us divided - but instead to think with clarity based on evidence and act with integrity based on principle.</p>
<p>There's a good reason why I don't pontificate about current controversies at my weblog, and I plan to keep it that way.</p>

<h2><a href="1727.html">Mental Junk Food</a></h2>
<h3>2022-08-01</h3>
<p>These days every article, video, podcast, or tweet needs to scream for your attention. Even worse, much of what you're shown online is determined by algorithms that put a premium on popularity, which is itself driven by the all-too-human feelings of greed for sensation and fear of disaster. In this brave new world of ours, news is literally a form of mental junk food.</p>
<p>One solution, of course, is to quit consuming the news. However, despite the fact that I've been on a low-information diet for many years and I endeavor to read not the times but the eternities, I recognize that it's not so easy for everyone to break the habit of believing that recently manufactured information is more important than agelessly organic wisdom.</p>
<p>Another solution might to heighten your awareness of what you're consuming. Just as nutrition labels have nudged many people toward better eating habits, perhaps we need nutrition labels for online content. Unfortunately, there are billions of web pages and thousands of news websites, so we can't hand-curate all that content. Paradoxically, we need computers to save us from the computers.</p>
<p>Enter Otherweb, a different sort of news service that gives you objective summaries of the latest news (without ads), enables you to set minimum quality levels, and even shows its work by providing helpful nutrition labels. If you want to learn what's new without that sugar high of mental overstimulation, I highly recommend giving Otherweb a try (and, if you're so inclined, providing feedback at Product Hunt). Your mind will thank you.</p>
<p>[Full disclosure: I'm an advisor to Otherweb because I strongly agree with its mission of fixing the world's information ecosystem.]</p>

<h2><a href="1726.html">Constraints</a></h2>
<h3>2022-07-28</h3>
<p>Recently I read two interesting quotes about the presence of constraints in life. The first was in a book of interviews on poetic structure entitled <cite>Fourteen on Form</cite>, in which one of the poets observed that students of his accustomed to writing free verse often didn't like writing in meter or rhyme because they couldn't say exactly what they wanted to say. The second was in an interview with the late, great jazz pianist and composer Lyle Mays, who said that you need to face some restrictions in order to stimulate creativity and have interesting problems to solve (you can hear the results in his final work, entitled Eberhard).</p>
<p>These statements are paradoxical. Isn't complete freedom the ideal? Aren't constraints distressingly limiting? How can I be my "true self" (a topic for another day) if I'm hemmed in by restrictions?</p>
<p>I don't see it that way. Great artworks like Shakespeare's sonnets or Bach's cello suites grew out of the very constraints of the forms in which the artists worked. Great buildings like Fallingwater do justice to their site and of course need to keep out the wind and rain (even though Frank Lloyd Wright is reputed to have said that "it's not architecture if the roof doesn't leak"!). Great athletes like Michael Jordan or Roger Federer are, after all, playing a game with well-defined rules. Great companies can't just do whatever they want but need to make products and services that both meet the needs of their customers and turn a profit so that they can stay in business. Great friendships and marriages are founded in give and take, mutual respect, and compassion that flows in both directions. Et cetera.</p>
<p>As the quote from Lyle Mays indicates, the positive power of constraints is not just about the outcome but more fundamentally about the process. Creatively solving a challenging problem is deeply engaging, whereas "tennis without a net" is simply a bore because it is way too easy.</p>
<p>So here's to constraints!</p>

<h2><a href="1725.html">Both Sides, Now</a></h2>
<h3>2022-07-21</h3>
<p>You hear it all the time: "this is a topic that both sides can agree on" ... "both sides are to blame for this mess" ... "she is one of those rare people who appeals to both sides" ... and so on.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>The first mistake we make is in thinking that there are only two perspectives, two outlooks, two worldviews, two groups.</p>
<p>For example, recently while visiting some relatives of mine in Canada I glanced at a book by Canadian journalist Stephen Marche entitled <cite>The Next Civil War</cite>, which seems to be based on the assumption that there are two sides arrayed against each other ready to go to war (!) over the future of America.</p>
<p>Puh-lease!</p>
<p>This kind of simplistic sensationalism makes good copy and no doubt sells books, but it's false to the much more complicated realities of life. Even in the relatively benighted realm of politics (which I attempt to studiously avoid), folks like the Pew Research Center (see their political typology report) recognize that there are more than two affiliations in America. For myself, I count economic conservatives, social conservatives, populists, centrists, liberals, progressives, Greens, socialists, libertarians, and probably a few others. (For a deep analysis of the four founding cultures in America, read <cite>Albion's Seed</cite> by historian David Hackett Fischer.)</p>
<p>To go even further, looking at the world in terms of isms is itself a simplification, because when you start talking about particular issues (say, strategies to address homelessness or proposed zoning changes in your locality) things can get nuanced rather quickly and it's not necessarily easy to predict where actual people will come down on such issues.</p>
<p>Recall the old joke: "There are only two kinds of people in the world: those who think there are two kinds of people in the world, and those who don't." You can be part of the solution by going beyond binary and recognizing that there are multiple perspectives out there, not just two.</p>
<p>P.S. Musically attuned readers will have already recognized that the title of this post refers to the great Joni Mitchell song "Both Sides, Now" (which was featured in last year's delightfully predictable yet heartwarming movie CODA).</p>

<h2><a href="1724.html">Have a Beautiful Life</a></h2>
<h3>2022-07-14</h3>
<p>Last week I explored how we might apply Aristotle's ideas about ethical beauty to the "micro level" of specific virtues and particular situations. This week I'd like to see how we might apply the same basic insights to the "macro level" of living a beautiful life.</p>
<p>Here again I'll consider Aristotle's six criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>Coherence (τάξις) is all about the arrangement of the parts of a thing. Several "things" seem relevant in this context. The first thing is what the ancients called the soul or ψυχή (my preferred translation is "aliveness"); Aristotle talked about the "nutritive soul" (physical needs like metabolism and growth, which we share even with the plants), the "perceptual soul" (wants engendered by the ability to perceive and move around in the world), and the "intellective soul" (wishes and imaginings made possible by the human faculty of λόγος = reason-and-speech). Finding the right balance or arrangement among these aspects of oneself contributes mightily to living well. The second thing is the various domains of life - health and vitality, achievement and purpose, relationships and caring, character and self-improvement, wisdom and learning, wonder and spirituality, etc. Here, too, generating deep coherence among them matters a great deal.</li>
<li>Proportion (συμμετρία) might be closely related to coherence, in the sense that most people don't want any particular aspect or pursuit to take up a disproportionate amount of time and energy. If all you do is, say, engage in physical exercise to stay healthy, then you might neglect other parts of life that need attention. However, what's proportionate for one person might not be proportionate for another: some folks really do focus most of their energies on just one or two aspects of life (say, great artists or scholars) and seem to be happy that way. Know thyself!</li>
<li>Order (τὸ ὡρισμένον) might involve a due ordering of your purposes in life: for instance, knowing what is valuable in itself vs. a means to an end. As an example, Aristotle argued that physical health is not a core constituent of eudaimonia but a precondition for the more fundamental pursuits involved in living a good life, such as relationships with other people. Similarly, he argued that wealth is not an end in itself.</li>
<li>Stature (μέγεθος) could be interpreted in terms of the scope or timespan involved in living well. A famous quote from Aristotle's <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> observes that "one swallow does not make a spring, nor does one day; and in the same way one day or a short time does not make a person blessed and happy". Achieving eudaimonia requires a lifelong approach to learning, self-improvement, relationships, and one's goals and purposes. That's stature.</li> 
<li>Unity (τὸ ὅλος) might imply what I like to translate as "wholeness" (αὐτάρκεια): a sense that your life isn't missing anything important; a related topic could be having a comprehensive understanding of life and your place in it, and applying that wisdom as unifying a force in your life.</li>
<li>Significance (σπουδαῖα) refers to the seriousness, significance, worth, and meaning of your life and the actions, projects, relationships, goals, and purposes that make it up. One of my favorite books about Aristotle's views on human flourishing is <cite>Taking Life Seriously</cite> by Francis Sparshott and that captures this idea quite well!</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, I'll note that these applications of Aristotle's ideas are quite speculative, but I hope you find them provocative for your own reflections.</p>

<h2><a href="1723.html">Beautifully Right</a></h2>
<h3>2022-07-07</h3>
<p>I seem to have fallen into a natural rhythm of alternating my posts between lighter and heavier topics; last week I talked about substitutions, so this week I figured I'd delve into something I touched on last year: what Aristotle means by acting for the sake of what is beautifully right.</p>
<p>It's fascinating that Aristotle uses the same word (καλός) to talk about both art and action. I render it as "beautifully right". Indeed, I believe that the so-called "doctrine of the mean" is merely a first approximation of good action and excellent character, since all it says is to avoid the extremes and instead pursue what's intermediate. A more precise formulation is to act for the sake of τὸ πρέπον or τὸ καλόν - for the sake of what is admirably appropriate or beautifully right.</p>
<p>How do we unpack this? As I explained in my post last year about the sources of beauty in Aristotle's philosophy (details there), five factors are involved, which I translate as coherence, proportion, order, stature, unity, and significance.</p>
<p>Let's see how these might apply to a specific situation, say generosity in helping a friend in need. Perhaps your friend is going through a difficult time in a relationship and could use several forms of assistance (e.g., moral support, legal advice, temporary financial support) over a period of a few months. How might we apply Aristotle's insights?</p>
<ol>
<li>Coherence (τάξις) refers to making all the parts of your assistance fit together well so that they are consistent, mutually reinforcing, and the like.</li>
<li>Proportion (συμμετρία) means ensuring that your actions correspond to your friend's need. Perhaps she could use a temporary loan of $1,000 to pay some emergency expenses - it isn't proportionate to lend her $100 or $10,000 (even if you could afford to do so).</li>
<li>Order (τὸ ὡρισμένον) is, to put it negatively, a lack of chaos; in this situation it might imply that you are steadfast in your support, that your emotional tone is consistent throughout your interactions, etc.</li>
<li>Stature (μέγεθος) refers to the magnitude of your generosity - perhaps ensuring that it is commensurate with how important this friendship is to you both and consistent with what you're realistically able to offer (perhaps you don't know anything about the legal issues but you can introduce her to a lawyer friend of yours).</li>
<li>Unity (τὸ ὅλος) captures an almost artistic sense that nothing is missing and that superfluous aspects are appropriately excluded (e.g., your friend needs moral, legal, and financial assistance but that doesn't mean you should buy her random gift cards, too).</li>
<li>Significance (σπουδαῖα) indicates that you take the matter seriously and act in a way that is deeply meaningful to the people involved.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are inklings that these criteria apply at the "macro" level of life in general as well as the "micro" level of particular situations, but I'll explore those in a future post.</p>
<p>I hasten to add that Aristotle doesn't spend a lot of time explaining these ideas in his writings, so this brief unpacking is speculative and intended to spur your own thinking. However, by doing this work we can see that there might be much more to Aristotle's ethical insights than "moderation in everything" (which he never said!). Instead, doing good involves discovering the practical truth in a given situation and then applying that knowledge by acting in a way that's admirably appropriate and beautifully right (by the way, this shows that Aristotle perceived a deep unity between the true, the good, and the beautiful). Not that any of this is easy, mind you, but at least Aristotle might have given us some guideposts along the way.</p>
