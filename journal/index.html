<h2><a href="1693.html">MLK and Personalism</a></h2>
<h3>2022-01-17</h3>
<p>In my recent post on idealism and identity, I mentioned my attraction to the philosophy of personalism, with its emphasis on human dignity. It is perhaps a little-known fact that Martin Luther King, Jr., was greatly influenced by that very philosophy. Early in life he ventured north to study at Boston University, then the center of personalist thought in America, where he completed his doctorate under theologian Edgar Sheffield Brightman. We can see the deep influence of personalism on King's views in two quotes from his famous "I Have a Dream" speech:</p>
<blockquote>We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny.</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.</blockquote>
<p>As noted in my 2019 post on personalism, I've compiled a long reading list about this school of thought, which I'll report on as I make progress.</p>

<h2><a href="1692.html">Idealism and Identity</a></h2>
<h3>2022-01-15</h3>
<p>Personal identity is a deep, and deeply meaningful, subject: at some level, what's more important than what makes you you? Paradoxically, throughout history and across cultures, often <em>personal</em> identity has been a <em>social</em> construct, tied closely to tribe, clan, family, ethnic group, race, caste, class, societal role, and so on - usually in opposition to some Other ("I'm a Capulet, not a Montague", "I'm a proletarian, not a bourgeois", etc.).</p>
<p>By contrast, the great wisdom traditions (what I once called the Minerval Arts) usually emphasize what Socrates called "the care of the soul": cultivating the moral and intellectual virtues, seeking wisdom and truth, consistently doing good works, becoming one with the divine, or in general realizing an ideal conception of the human person in your own life.</p>
<p>Naturally, things aren't quite that simple (they never are!). Personal flourishing could be difficult or next to impossible if you're a member of an untouchable caste, if you're shipped off to a concentration camp, or if you're so poor that you're hemmed in by what Earl Shorris (in his excellent book <cite>Riches for the Poor</cite>) called the "surround of force". On the other side of the equation, we know from history and from hard experience that it's all too easy for self-cultivation to morph into narcissism, truth-seeking into dogmatism, doing good into authoritarianism, religion into sectarianism, idealism into fanaticism.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I find the wisdom traditions deeply attractive, for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They provide stronger foundations for a culture of human flourishing than do conceptions of personal identity that are based on unchosen, immutable characteristics of human beings within strictly-defined groups.</li>
  <li>Despite their focus on self-improvement, because they almost always build up <em>communities</em> of learning and practice they do not advocate purely solitary pursuits; for instance, even an outwardly hedonistic tradition like Epicureanism stressed the importance of friends helping each other to become better people.</li>
  <li>The ethical virtues they encourage are usually quite pro-social (generosity, moderation, tolerance, justice, etc.) - more so than ways of life that are based on group solidarity and cohesion, where in-group psychology frequently leads to intolerance of those outside the group.</li>
  <li>Similarities across wisdom traditions have the potential to bridge otherwise intractable cultural divides; examples include Taoism and Epicureanism, Stoicism and Christianity, Confucianism and Aristotelianism, Buddhism and Pyrrhonism.</li>
  <li>They leave some measure of space in human life for reflection, learning, choice, effort, and hope; without these, life would feel awfully barren.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, at least for myself, over any strict form of socially-constructed identity I heartily prefer even an uncertain and unreliable but idealistic personalism.</p>
<p>P.S. After writing this entry, I found a fine expression of the value of idealism in Rob Riemen's book <cite>Nobility of Spirit: A Forgotten Ideal</cite> (pp. 57-58):</p>
<blockquote>There can be no civilization without the realization that human beings have a double nature. They have a physical, earthly existence but are distinguished from other animals by <em>also</em> having a spiritual being and by knowing the world of ideas. They know about truth, goodness, and beauty, are familiar with freedom and justice, love and charity. The basis of every form of civilization is the concept that humans derive their dignity and true identity not from what they are - flesh and blood - but from what they should be: the embodiment of these immortal life-affirming qualities, these values that encapsulate the finest aspects of human existence, the image of human dignity.</blockquote>

<h2><a href="1691.html">Cultivating Curiosity</a></h2>
<h3>2022-01-08</h3>
<p>In my drive to hold fewer opinions (or at least hold them less strongly), for a while I tried to cultivate a healthy skepticism about things I believe - for instance, by attempting to question one opinion every week. This didn't work, at least for me, because it felt too negative. Instead, now I'm working to cultivate curiosity. Here are a few thoughts on the process.</p>
<p>First, opinions are not free-floating entities in the world, but are held by people (sometimes so strongly that their identity is bound up with their beliefs). Thus I seek to consider why someone might hold an opinion that I don't. There could be many reasons: their experiences are different from mine, they've read different books than I have, they're at a different time of life than I am, their cultural background is different from mine, they prioritize things differently than I do, etc.</p>
<p>Second, I seek to decouple an opinion from what I perceive as its implications in the world and treat it in a purely intellectual or exploratory fashion. (This might be similar to what Julia Galef calls the scout mindset, although I've not yet read her book.) The core experience is getting to the point where I can say to myself, "huh, that's an interesting way of looking at things" without judging people who might look at things that way.</p>
<p>Third, coming back to myself, I apply these two techniques to my own opinions. Maybe I think what I think because I've had certain experiences or I've read certain books or I grew up in a certain time and place (etc.). Maybe other ways of looking at things are just as interesting as mine, or better illuminate phenomena or explain causes than mine does, or provide a valuable perspective that I hadn't considered (etc.).</p>
<p>Becoming more curious doesn't necessarily mean that I change my mind, because I'm not convinced that I can really do that. Instead, changing my mind seems like a gradual process, not a matter of flipping a switch or actively pushing myself in a certain direction.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, cultivating curiosity is not merely mental but has practical benefits. As I observed in my last post, cultivating curiosity with regard to other people leads to cultivating empathy. I'll need to ponder whether it might lead to cultivating other virtues as well, such as patience or generosity.</p>

<h2><a href="1690.html">Cultivating Empathy</a></h2>
<h3>2022-01-01</h3>
<p>If you ask those I work with or mentor what my distinctive personal qualities are, I suspect that on the short list you might find empathy. For instance, I often reach out to work colleagues if I know that they face significant challenges, if their skills aren't being fully utilized, if they're not appreciated as much as they should be, if someone on their team has resigned, or on the positive side if they've been doing great work.</p>
<p>It might surprise such people to learn that I am not a naturally empathetic person. Another of my distinctive qualities is a sense of perspective, which in my case is connected with an attitude of distance or detachment. As I've worked more closely with people over the last ten years of my career, I've had to push myself to reach out, to listen, to empathize. By counteracting one of my natural tendencies, I've turned empathy into something approaching the "second nature" of an excellence of character.</p>
<p>As Aristotle says in Book Two of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>We must consider the things towards which we ourselves also are easily carried away; for some of us tend to one thing, some to another; and this will be recognizable from the pleasure and the pain we feel. We must drag ourselves away to the contrary extreme; for we shall get into the intermediate state by drawing well away from error, as people do in straightening sticks that are bent.</blockquote>
<p>Although I don't want to over-simplify what's involved in cultivating empathy or other character strengths, in my experience much of it is simply stopping to think about other people. "She's been working so hard on this project, I wonder how she's holding up?" "So-and-so just resigned, I should see how his teammates are doing." "I've really been impressed by how she's handled interactions with this client, I think I'll let her manager know." And so on. Such questions naturally lead to being curious about others, to caring about them, and to reaching out to them. By building up a practice of such thoughts and actions, I've become much more empathetic over time.</p>
<p>In future posts I'll explore in greater depth the topic of cultivating various virtues, with insights from thinkers as varied as Aristotle, Confucius, Ben Franklin, and positive psychologists like Martin Seligman and Chris Peterson.</p>

<h2><a href="1689.html">Monadnock Valley Press Annual Report 2021</a></h2>
<h3>2022-01-01</h3>
<p>Happy Public Domain Day!</p>
<p>Over at monadnock.net (my site for public-domain writings), in 2021 I republished works by Joseph Addison, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Homer, Langston Hughes, Henrik Ibsen, William James, Lucian, Alexander Pope, Edwin Arlington Robinson, Voltaire, and Virginia Woolf. Inspired in part by a conversation with Gytis Daujotas of Library Athena, I also optimized quite a few longer works for online reading by breaking them into smaller chunks (typically one web page per chapter for novels, per poem for poetry collections, per act for plays, and per section or chapter for nonfiction works).</p>
<p>For 2022 and beyond I've greatly expanded the publication roadmap to include, among other things, many more novels. In the early years I shied away from publishing novels because their length makes them hard to read online, but now that I've started "chunking" large works I feel that novels are fair game. Thus you'll see novels by the likes of Jane Austen, George Eliot, and Victor Hugo on the list of works that I plan to republish in future years.</p>

<h2><a href="1688.html">Questions and Answers</a></h2>
<h3>2021-12-29</h3>
<p>Consider the following statements... "There are no answers, only questions." "Life is all about the journey, not the destination." "A teacher or a counselor should encourage dialogue, not provide direction." All true as far as they go. And yet.</p>
<p>Life is finite. There is no escaping the necessity for answers and destinations and directions, even if in some sense they are never final but only provisional. If you ask the love of your life for an answer to the question "Will you marry me?" then presumably you don't want to hear that there are no answers, only questions! Any journey worthy of the name consists of a series of interim destinations, not completely random wanderings. Dialogue is delightful, but at its most constructive it results in realizations - often inspired by directions that a person or a book suggests - enabling you to make decisions about your future.</p>
<p>Here as always there is a balance to be struck.</p>
<p>On the one hand, if you're merely handed the answers or informed of your destination or told what direction to go in, then you're not truly learning or building the skills you must acquire in order to live well. On the other hand, a genuinely wise person knows that some answers and destinations and directions are better than others, and strives to help others avoid the brambles and stay on a path to flourishing and fulfillment.</p>
<p>And here as always it's finding the beautifully right balance that is the greatest challenge. As Spinoza says at the very end of his <cite>Ethics</cite>, "all things excellent are as difficult as they are rare."</p>
