<h2><a href="1941.html">Scaling the State</a></h2>
<h3>2025-03-04</h3>
<p>By no means do I have "the solution" for what ails the American body politic - as always, there are many causes (and many competing solutions) for our current predicament. And to be clear, I speak not about the day-to-day ins and outs of what's happening in the District of Columbia - who can keep track of it all? - but about longer-term trends. One of those trends is the ever-increasing centralization of governance at the national level.</p>
<p>As I understand it from my readings in American history, the Framers had great admiration for small republics ancient and modern (Athens, Rome, Florence, Venice, Switzerland, etc.) and wished to emulate their success. It was James Madison who had the insight to forge a republic on a larger scale than any previous state except perhaps the Roman Republic. Yet it's pretty clear that things aren't working out quite as the Framers planned.</p>
<p>Part of the challenge is that it's hard to scale the state. The best-governed countries in the world are all relatively small. If we take lack of corruption as a rough proxy for quality of governance, the best-governed countries are as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Denmark (population 6m)</li>
  <li>Finland (population 5.6m)</li>
  <li>Singapore (population 6m)</li>
  <li>New Zealand (population 5.5m)</li>
  <li>Luxembourg (population 700k)</li>
  <li>Norway (population 5.5m)</li>
  <li>Switzerland (population 9m)</li>
  <li>Sweden (population 10.5m)</li>
</ol>
<p>For purposes of comparison, the population of those countries ranges from about the size of Vermont to about the size of Michigan. Of course, good government depends on many factors other than the size of the population (culture, laws, historical precedent, institutions, etc.), but size isn't nothing, either. Would an Anglosphere country such as New Zealand be as well governed if instead of having 5.5 million people it had 340 million people like the USA? I doubt it.</p>
<p>Another factor underlying the quality of governance is simple competence. More specifically, as countless corporate conglomerates have discovered, it's difficult to do many things well. The Constitution defined a short list of national matters to be handled by the national government, with everything else to be handled by states, counties, towns, cities, and other localities closer to the people. The short list did not include housing, education, energy, transportation, labor relations, and a whole host of other things that partisans fight over these days at the national level. Moreover, many of those now-national functions are also duplicated at the state level, leading to further inefficiencies.</p>
<p>Could it be that engaging in these activities only at the state (or more local level) might lead to better governance across the board in polities more on the scale of the independent nations listed above? It certainly seems like a direction to pursue, especially since that's how the American system was set up to operate in the first place.</p>
<p>But I'm just one powerless person without any influence over national, state, or local affairs, so who am I to prescribe political remedies?</p>

<h2><a href="1940.html">Writing as Thinking</a></h2>
<h3>2025-03-03</h3>
<p>Why write? I can't speak for anyone else, but for me writing is a form of thinking. Although I often have vague notions floating around in my head, they don't crystallize until I formulate them in black and white. Before words can inform, they must be formed.</p>
<p>The best examples from my own practice are the short books I write to set down my encounters with great thinkers like Nietzsche, Thoreau, and now Aristotle. For instance, as I've worked through Aristotle's philosophy over the last five years I've probably read 50,000 pages by and about him - his complete works, the dialogues of Plato, and countless books and papers from the scholarly literature. Yet that was just the beginning, since the reading itself has been followed by copying thousands of marked-up passages into the digital equivalent of an old-fashioned commonplace book (still in progress), noticing connections among these passages, making integrations across Aristotle's works from metaphysics to biology to ethics to aesthetics, consulting the original Greek texts, figuring out my preferred (often novel) renderings for key philosophical terms, posing questions to myself, spelling out my provisional conclusions about those questions either in private notes or public blog posts, comparing Aristotle's views with those of more modern thinkers, identifying situations in my own life where I can apply what I've learned, and in general pondering the meaning of it all. And that's all before putting pen to paper in a definitive manner!</p>
<p>Indeed, I realized recently (upon reading a post on writing by my friend Betsy Mikel) that I'm not necessarily even wedded to writing a book about Aristotle's conception of human fulfillment - except it's only by doing so that I'll actually understand what he said and how I can put his insights to work in my own efforts to do a better job at living.</p>
<p>This sketch of my writing/thinking process illustrates my I'm so skeptical about prompting "artificial intelligence" software for "the answers" to the most enduring perplexities of human existence. As Hannah Arendt described years ago in her magisterial book <cite>The Life of the Mind</cite>, the purpose of this kind of deep thinking (as opposed to problem-solving, goal-oriented cognition) isn't to obtain "the answers" at all. Instead, deep thinking is an end in itself. Aristotle put it by saying that human fulfillment extends as far as awareness [theoria] does, but the idea was more memorably captured by Socrates when he declared in his courtroom defense that the unthinking life is not worth living for a human being.</p>

<h2><a href="1939.html">The Joy of Creation</a></h2>
<h3>2025-03-02</h3>
<p>Several times now I've been exposed to "poems" generated by LLMs, whether sent to me by friends or posted by bloggers. Leaving aside their questionable quality, I would never use LLMs in this way. To me, the joy of creation lies not in the artifact but in the artistry. Would you prompt an LLM-equipped robot to attend a concert or sporting event on your behalf, take a walk with your child, or meet your best friend for lunch? I shudder to think that people might do such things before long. Similarly, writing poems, composing music, making pottery, and the like are not instances of drudgery but creative acts emblematic of the life of a free person.</p>
<p>For tasks in which efficiency, productivity, impressing your boss, and getting the right answer are paramount, I sort of understand the appeal of LLMs. Thankfully, now that I'm out of the workforce I no longer need to do such things. Instead, I have the freedom to think and play and create in the realms of music, poetry, and philosophy to my heart's content at my own pace. Because I find these activities perfectly delightful on their own, I'd find it intrusive and degrading to interact with an LLM while engaging in them.</p>
<p>It's becoming increasingly evident that our human world is being invaded by "artificial intelligence" (I always use scare quotes because the term begs many questions). People who are dear to me use LLMs every day to complete the banausic tasks their work requires, and I don't judge them for it. But each of us must be intentional and deliberate about whether and where we will use this new technology. For me, I draw the line at autotelic activities that are and of right ought to be ends in themselves.</p>

<h2><a href="1938.html">In Medias Res</a></h2>
<h3>2025-03-02</h3>
<p>(This post introduces my new Substack newsletter, <a href="https://beautifulwisdom.substack.com/">Beautiful Wisdom</a>.)</p>
<p>Well, here we are in the middle of things. I mean that in several senses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Personally, I've been writing, publishing, and blogging for 25+ years. Posting at Substack is a continuation and evolution of that long-running activity, not something fundamentally new for me.</li>
<li>Historically, culturally, and technologically, it appears that we're in the thick of massive changes. Yet appearances can be deceiving, and I plan to bring the insights of history and philosophy (as well as my quarter century in the software industry) to bear on understanding where we've been, where we are, and where we're going.</li>
<li>Politically, the pendulum seems to be swinging wildly from left to right. Although I prefer to steer clear of political topics, occasionally I'll be speaking from the middle in favor of moderation, brotherhood, and being reasonable - all the while doing what I can to live up to the American ideals of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</li>
<li>Philosophically, my perspective is broadly consistent with the classical and especially Aristotelian focus on practical wisdom, human fulfillment, a noble way of life, and doing justice to the complexities of our common experience by finding a middle way between extremes.</li>
</ol>
<p>As to the title of this venue - Beautiful Wisdom - it represents my commitment to appreciating the enduring and evanescent beauty of the world we live in, bringing something beautiful into existence by composing poetry and music, and treating people as beautifully as I can in my all-too-brief span on this earth.</p>
<p>Onward and upward!</p>

<h2><a href="1937.html">A Poem a Day Keeps the Doldrums Away</a></h2>
<h3>2025-02-25</h3>
<p>To keep my sanity and experience more beauty in life, I endeavor to read a few poems every day. To facilitate this practice among other people, I've decided to start a Substack newsletter with a simple mission: publish one classic poem a day from the vast store of English-language verse in the public domain that I've already uploaded to the Monadnock Valley Press website. Check it out at the link below.</p>

<h2><a href="1936.html">Inwardly Free</a></h2>
<h3>2025-02-09</h3>
<p>A while back I learned of a poet and historian named Peter Viereck (1916-2006), who not only won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1949 but also wrote insightful books of social and literary criticism in the American individualist tradition of Emerson, Thoreau, and Randolph Bourne. In his now-forgotten book <cite>The Unadjusted Man</cite>, published in 1956, Viereck celebrated the kind of person who dodges the pressures of conformity (what he called "overadjustment") to maintain a measure of intellectual independence. Here is a fine passage about one path to becoming an "unadjusted man":</p>
<blockquote>To remain an individual in an overadjusted society, start out, first of all, by being an amateur at everything, never a professional. This is true whether you are a poet, scholar, or political leader, whether you are an artist of life, love, or billiards. According to Mark Twain, to play billiards moderately well is the sign of a gentleman; to play it too well is the sign of a mis-spent life. In an age of boorish, narrow specialists and of efficient experts who do everything "too well" in unimaginative, slavish stereotypes, in such an age only the amateur stays inwardly free. An amateurish life is a life of harmonious proportion because it alone finds time to cultivate the complete human being, public and private, cerebral and emotional. A free society requires not only free ideals, free institutions, but free personalities. The free personality is an "amateur" in both senses: (1) he who does things for love, not utility; (2) the non-technician, not yet deprived of creative imagination by expertise.</blockquote> 
<p>Although Viereck paints with too broad a brush - to take but one example, pianist Glenn Gould was both a consummate professional and a consummate individualist - his central point about being "inwardly free" is worthy of serious consideration. At root this is a matter not necessarily of professional status but of <em>attitude</em>. I'll grant that the attitude - similar, perhaps, to the "beginner's mind" that Buddhists try to manifest - might be easier to keep if one doesn't feel a need to achieve the status, yet it does seem like something that even non-amateurs could cultivate...</p>
