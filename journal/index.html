<h2><a href="1733.html">Good Things Come in Threes</a></h2>
<h3>2022-09-01</h3>
<p>In my recent post "There's No Such Thing as the Mind", I expressed astonishment at a statement by Italian philosopher Maurizio Ferraris to the effect that one's body is part of the external world. This raises the question of what exactly is internal vs. external, and how to categorize the various good things we value in life.</p>
<p>A distinction between external goods and other goods goes back at least as far as Aristotle, for whom these "other goods" included goods of the body and goods of the soul. External goods include wealth, possessions, reputation, honor, status, power, position, and other results of good fortune in life. Goods of the body include health, strength, vitality, and the like. Goods of the soul include knowledge, wisdom, awareness, memory, experience, emotions, talents, skills, character, personality, and so on.</p>
<p>On this schema, it's not completely clear to me how to categorize certain good things in life. (Not that categorizing things is necessarily all that meaningful!) For instance, take skills like the ability to play the piano: in some ways it's a good of the soul but in other ways it's a good of the body (we talk about muscle memory and knowledge being in your fingers and such). Note that this is yet another reason not to draw hard boundaries between body and soul; we can consider both goods of the body and goods of the soul to be internal goods.</p>
<p>Another key example is that of close personal relationships (what Aristotle calls φιλία - usually translated as friendship but in ancient Greek it included marriage, family, and partnerships of many kinds). Aristotle says that friends are the greatest of external goods, but this doesn't feel quite right. Enlightenment on this topic came to me recently in reading <cite>Virtue and Psychology</cite> by Blaine Fowers, who carves out, in addition to external goods and internal goods, a category of shared goods. These are good things that arise only through coordinated activity among two or more people, such as friendship, marriage, family, teamwork, service, solidarity, and community.</p>
<p>What's the upshot of all this categorizing? In practice, is it helpful to understand whether a good thing in your life is internal, external, or shared? I think so.</p>
<p>Consider, for instance, the prospect of getting fired (which has happened to me twice in my career). True, it's no fun to lose your job (an external good), but knowing that you still have the underlying skills and talents (internal goods) that enabled you to be a productive worker in the first place can give you confidence that the loss is in all likelihood only temporary.</p>
<p>Consider, also, the importance of close personal relationships like marriage and friendship. In her book <cite>Friendship, Robots, and Social Media</cite>, Alexis Elder provides an excellent account of how a friendship is a joint project - a kind of "third thing" above and beyond the two persons involved. (Although I haven't read it yet, I gather that Terry Real makes similar points with regard to marriage in his book <cite>Us: Getting Past You and Me to Build a More Loving Relationship</cite>.) It's not as if this kind of partnership is a purely instrumental means to the independent end of my own pleasant experiences; instead, the partnership is an inherent constituent of living well. More on this theme next week...</p>

<h2><a href="1732.html">Thoughts, Actions, Values</a></h2>
<h3>2022-08-25</h3>
<p>Aristotle's <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> famously begins with the following sentence (as translated by W.D. Ross):</p>
<blockquote>Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things aim.</blockquote>
<p>We can see here a point of connection between my two recent posts "There's No Such Thing as the Mind" and "It's Values All the Way Down". For Aristotle, who founded the science of biology, all of our physical activities <em>and also all of our intellectual activities</em> are rooted in the needs and yearnings of our aliveness.</p>
<p>The equally famous first sentence of Aristotle's <cite>Metaphysics</cite> goes like this (translated by yours truly):</p>
<blockquote>All people naturally reach out to know.</blockquote>
<p>Yet he means not disembodied minds seeking value-free science, but living, breathing human beings seeking value-infused sagacity (σοφία). In line with Aristotle's threefold analyses of both ethical and intellectual virtues, the opposites of sagacity are on the one hand ignorance (the absolute lack of knowledge) and on the other hand sophistry (mere knowledge without the benefit of insight into or guidance by what is best).</p>
<p>The fact that no human endeavors, not even our intellectual endeavors, are completely value-neutral is not something to be lamented but something to be celebrated, because it is a sign and consequence of our deeply integrated nature as thinking, acting, valuing creatures.</p>

<h2><a href="1731.html">Meditations on Bach #11: Mocha 5 Bass</a></h2>
<h3>2022-08-23</h3>
<p>I'm delighted to report that today I took delivery of a custom-made Symphony electric bass from Stradi Basses in Poland. It is absolutely gorgeous, sounds wonderful, and plays beautifully! Luthier Marek Dąbek was a dream to work with and he met all of my requirements with true craftsmanship and creativity, building with the expert assistance of his wife Agnieska an instrument we're calling the "Mocha 5". I now have a magnificent five-string bass, natively tuned in fifths using custom strings by Italian string maker Galli, that will provide a strong foundation for my transcriptions of the Bach Cello Suites (as well as some original solo bass pieces I'm composing). Wow! Thank you, Marek and Agnieska!</p>

<h2><a href="1730.html">It's Values All the Way Down</a></h2>
<h3>2022-08-18</h3>
<p>One often hears the claim that science must be value-neutral, especially in social sciences like economics, psychology, and sociology. This claim is one instance of fact-value dualism: the doctrine that facts are facts, values are values, and never the twain shall meet. Another instance of this dualism is the assertion (traceable to British empiricist David Hume) that you can't derive an "ought" from an "is".</p>
<p>Given my well-known aversion to dualisms of all kinds, it should come as no surprise that I'm not impressed by these claims and assertions. For those who are inclined to theoretical philosophy, a fine rebuttal can be found in Hilary Putnam's book <cite>The Collapse of the Fact/Value Dichotomy</cite>. Here's how I would illustrate the matter in a more homely fashion...</p>
<p>Empiricist: Science must be value-neutral!</p>
<p>Me: So you're saying that scientists ought to practice value-neutrality?</p>
<p>Empiricist: Yes, of course!</p>
<p>Me: Or, in other words, that value-neutrality is a core value of all scientific endeavor?</p>
<p>Empiricist: Indeed it is!</p>
<p>Me: Well then, it sounds like science isn't value-neutral with regard to the value of value-neutrality, is it?</p>
<p>Empiricist: Hmm...</p>
<p>This might sound like a purely abstract issue, but it has very practical consequences. For instance, in economics the doctrine of fact-value dualism leads theorists to say that all we can study is utility-maximization; because utility is essentially equivalent to pleasure (cf. Jeremy Bentham) or in scientifically dressed up language "desire satisfaction", this doctrine effectively smuggles hedonism in through the back door. So much for value-neutrality!</p>
<p>The solution to this kind of smuggling is to trade openly in values, as it were: to be honest about the values we bring to the topic before us, to engage in dialogue with those who see things differently, to critique and revise our commitments where necessary, and so on. Naturally, this is difficult and messy, but it's much more realistic and reasonable than trying to rule values out of court with a wave of one's hand.</p>

<h2><a href="1729.html">There's No Such Thing as the Mind</a></h2>
<h3>2022-08-11</h3>
<p>Not long ago, a friend recommended that I check out the work of Italian philosopher Maurizio Ferraris, so I promptly ordered his book <cite>Manifesto of New Realism</cite> via interlibrary loan. Overall it is a valiant attempt to dig out of the hole of postmodernism - valuable, at the very least, for those who have fallen into that particular hole in the first place. Ferraris identifies one aspect of the constraints I talked about recently, in the form of what he calls "unamendability" (i.e., the fact that some aspects of reality cannot be changed by human wishes and ideas). On page 35 of the English translation, he writes:</p>
<blockquote>As I said, I propose we define this fundamental character of reality's "unamendability": the fact that what we face cannot be corrected or changed by the mere use of conceptual schemes, unlike what happens in the hypothesis of constructivism. This, however, is not only a limit, it is also a resource. Unamendability, in fact, informs us about the existence of an external world, not in relation to our body (which is part of the external world) but in relation to our minds and more specifically with respect to the conceptual schemes with which we try to explain and interpret the world.</blockquote>
<p>I'd like to draw attention to his astounding claim that one's body is part of the external world! This implies that there exists an internal world consisting only of a <em>thing</em> called mind. To believe this is to commit the fallacy of reification: treating an abstraction (in this case certain activities of human beings, for instance speech, understanding, and concept-formation) as an independently existing entity (in this case "the mind"). It's surprising to me that an otherwise quite sophisticated thinker could accept the conceptual crudities of this kind of mental idealism, but so it seems to be.</p>
<p>For myself, I prefer a common-sense personalism that considers each human being to be an integrated whole with an indivisible identity.</p>

<h2><a href="1728.html">Controversies</a></h2>
<h3>2022-08-04</h3>
<p>While reading the autobiography of Charles Darwin a few weeks ago, I came across the following passage:</p>
<blockquote>I rejoice that I have avoided controversies, and this I owe to [Charles] Lyell, who many years ago, in reference to my geological works, strongly advised me never to get entangled in a controversy, as it rarely did any good and caused a miserable loss of time and temper.</blockquote>
<p>This passage is slightly ironic, because no scientific work has been more controversial over the last 175 years than Darwin's theory of evolution. Clearly, Darwin did not shy away from explosive topics, so what did he mean by avoiding controversies?</p>
<p>A peek at my trusty 1828 edition of Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language yielded a definition I immediately fell in love with: a controversy is "an agitation of contrary opinions" (similar, perhaps, to a murder of crows or an exaltation of larks, as I explored long ago in my nonsense poem "The Problem of the One and the Many").</p>
<p>Because I said quite enough on the subject of opinions in a series of blog posts last year, today I'd like to think about the agitation aspect.</p>
<p>Agitation implies a number of phenomena, all negative: a violent stirring of emotions, a tumultuous confusion of voices, a disorderly mob of opposing groups, and the like. In the agitation of contrary opinions, there are two primary vicitms:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The reasonable weighing of evidence and insights in pursuit of truth and wisdom.</li>
  <li>All feelings of calm, tranquility, and serenity (as Darwin put it: "a miserable loss of [good] temper").</li>
</ol>
<p>Sadly, we all seem to be in a state of constant agitation these days, tossed about in a neverending battle of in-groups vs. out-groups in which we're nearly forced to take one side or the other side. But only nearly: each of us can decide to step outside the fray, to go beyond binary allegiances, to focus on the eternities, to never get entangled in the deafening controversies that keep us divided - but instead to think with clarity based on evidence and act with integrity based on principle.</p>
<p>There's a good reason why I don't pontificate about current controversies at my weblog, and I plan to keep it that way.</p>
