<h2><a href="1963.html">Whence Wonder?</a></h2>
<h3>2025-05-23</h3>
<p>Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle held that philosophy - the love and practice of wisdom - begins in wonder. But whence wonder?</p>
<p>At the beginning of his <cite>Metaphysics</cite> (982b12 ff.), Aristotle observes that in the lead-up to philosophy people wondered first about "the strange things near at hand" and then about celestial phenomena like the moon, the stars, and the origin of the universe. What were these "strange things" that people found so fascinating and astonishing?</p>
<p>One prominent example might have been the ambiguous, confusing nature of human beings. Consider the wonder or amazement (θαύμα) with which we can be struck speechless or reduced to babbling (ψελλίζω) when we weigh (ὑπολαμβάνω) the overlapping nature (ἐπάλλαξις) of human beings, wavering or teetering (ἐπαμφοτερίζω) as we do between independent and herdlike, competitive and cooperative, deceptive and truthful, ignorant and insightful, cunning and just, foolish and wise, beastly and godlike.</p>
<p>There's a cluster of concepts here that might not be immediately obvious. To unravel things we can start by pulling on any one of the threads, so let's look at ἐπάλλαξις, which is a certain overlapping or intermixture of characteristics. If we think of Aristotle as a strict taxonomist like Linnaeus, we'd be wrong. In his biological works, Aristotle identified numerous animals that have overlapping characteristics and thus "waver" or "teeter" or "dualize" (ἐπαμφοτερίζω) between natural kinds: seals dualize between water animals and land animals, hermit crabs between crustaceans and testaceans, sea anemones between plants and animals, apes and monkeys and baboons between humans and quadrupeds, etc. Similarly, although Aristotle famously said that human beings are political animals, we are also "social solitaries" who tend toward both ends of the continuum from independent to herdlike (<cite>Historia Animalium</cite>, 487b33 ff).</p>
<p>Ambiguities like these can reduce one to babbling (ψελλίζω): if someone asks you whether seal are land animals <em>or</em> water animals - or whether humans are, say, competitive <em>or</em> cooperative - you might not be able to say. Moreover, in his <cite>Magna Moralia</cite> (1197a31), Aristotle says that ὑπόληψις (the noun derived from ὑπολαμβάνω, in the sense of taking something up for consideration, entertaining a notion, or weighing alternative accounts) is that whereby we "waver" or "teeter" (ἐπαμφοτερίζω) between thinking that something is one way or another.</p>
<p>Yet Aristotle was anything but an epistemological defeatist: "the strange things near at hand" inspire us to wonder and then to inquiry, thought, and dialogue. Indeed, the longer I live and the more deeply I reflect, the more I wonder about the sorts of overlapping, dualizing phenomena that seem to be characteristic not only of human affairs but also of physics (light is both a particle and a wave), biology (are viruses alive or not?), history (in which there's never just one cause), and so on. There are endless sources of wonder in life, if only we can attune ourselves to them!</p>

<h2><a href="1962.html">Reading Spinoza</a></h2>
<h3>2025-05-22</h3>
<p>Over the last few weeks I've been re-reading Spinoza's <cite>Ethics</cite> yet again, this time inspired by a review of Kieran Fox's newly-published spiritual biography of Einstein, which noted that when pressed about his religious beliefs the great scientist claimed to believe in Spinoza's God.</p>
<p>Even though I took a graduate-level course on Spinoza back in college and have read the <cite>Ethics</cite> several times, I must confess that I find the nature of Spinoza's God to be rather opaque. However, I'm not alone in this regard, because apparently it's a matter of some scholarly contention. Clare Carlisle's recent book <cite>Spinoza's Religion</cite> might clarify matters, but I haven't read it yet.</p>
<p>My professor at Columbia repeatedly enjoined us to "don our Spinozistic glasses" when attempting to understand Spinoza's ideas, but I'm finding it helpful to don a wide variety of glasses: Platonic, Aristotelian, Taoist, Hindu, Buddhist, even Randian! Following Hannah Arendt's suggestion that "the god of the philosophers" is being itself, as I'm reading I will sometimes test Spinoza's statements about God by substituting terms like Being, What-Is, Existence, the All, the One, the Infinite, Brahman, and Tao. Some of these work at times, but not at others; for instance, although Spinoza talks about "the mind of God", I can't make sense of phrases like "the mind of Existence" or "the mind of Tao".</p>
<p>Given my immersion in Aristotle and Greek philosophy more generally, substitutions for other terms can ease the path to understanding, at least for me. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>"substance" is an English rendering of Latin "substantia", which in turn was a translation of the Greek word οὐσία meaning "thinghood" or "entity" (this last term seem to map most closely to Spinoza's "substance")</li>
<li>"essence" is an English rendering of Latin "essentia", which in turn was a translation of the cumbersome Aristotelian phrase τό τί ἦν εἶναι or "what it is to be a thing"</li>
<li>for "attribute" I've been substituting "way of being" (my preferred rendering of Greek εἶδος)</li>
<li>for "mode" I've been substituting "instantiation"</li>
<li>for "accident" I've been substituting "aspect"</li>
</ul>
<p>These substitutions aren't always workable, and I suppose they might take me further from Spinoza's intended meanings, but as Aristotle said we often need to start from what is more familiar to us, especially when the intellectual road is rough and full of impasses.</p>

<h2><a href="1961.html">Freedom of Screech</a></h2>
<h3>2025-05-13</h3>
<p>My alma mater, Columbia University, was back in the news yet again last week because some screeching students took over parts of Butler Library while serious students were preparing for final exams. The details are unimportant in this context; instead I'm puzzled by what passes for speech these days.</p>
<p>In ancient Greek, the word λόγος means, at root, both thought and speech: it is simultaneously the thinking that reveals itself in speech and the speaking that reveals what a person is thinking. Mindlessly chanting slogans with one's fellow "activists" barely counts as speech, if you ask me, because there is barely any thought behind it - to mention a few more meanings of λόγος, those who merely screech offer no reasoned account of their ideas and are not seeking a conversation in pursuit of truth. Comparatively speaking, the anti-war protesters who engaged in sit-ins at Columbia 60+ years ago were paragons of intellectualism, for many of them held teach-ins and earnestly sought to persuade others of their point of view.</p>
<p>Freedom of speech is enshrined in the First Amendment for many good reasons, but I am far less impressed by freedom of screech, especially since it is typically accompanied by physical intimidation that goes well beyond peaceful association with likeminded others.</p>

<h2><a href="1960.html">Intellectual Honesty</a></h2>
<h3>2025-05-08</h3>
<p>In his book <cite>The Faith of a Heretic</cite>, Walter Kaufmann spells out an ethic of intellectual honesty. (The book covers many other topics, but that's the core of it.) He sets admirably high standards for himself and anyone else who would, in the words of his fellow philosopher Jan Patočka, live in truth. As Kaufmann presents it, intellectual honesty is a challenging virtue because we're all liable to limit ourselves to the comfortable confines of what we already know - or think we know.</p>
<p>Here are some of the particular practices suggested by Kaufmann that I found especially significant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a keen intellectual conscience, i.e., make your beliefs, opinions, statements, and philosophical commitments a matter of conscience. Specific qualities here include being imaginative, careful, and scrupulous.</li>
<li>Don't fear disagreement. Indeed, "fear of disagreement is for a philosopher what fear of getting hurt is for a soldier - cowardice." Shun facile agreement, seek out disagreement, and explore plausible alternatives to your own long-held views.</li>
<li>Avoid self-deception. Because (as I like to say) self-deception is the easiest thing in the world, avoiding it can be quite difficult and involves, among other things, trying to see your own faults - perhaps with a little help from your friends or your intellectual opponents.</li>
<li>Don't think in labels or assume that label-like concepts ("good", "evil", etc.) have one central meaning that everyone agrees on. The most important concepts are fundamentally contested.</li>
<li>Raise your standards and demand more of yourself. Most people are honest, but (according to Kaufmann) minimally so because they don't want to rock the boat. The deeply honest person should seek out other perspectives, criticize their own positions, remain open to objections, and retain only what stands up in the face of thoroughgoing examination.</li>
<li>Don't begin with your own viewpoint and then repudiate whatever conflicts with it; instead, repeatedly encounter other viewpoints in a spirit of dialogue, opening yourself to objections, concerns, alternatives, modifications, replies, and refutations.</li>
<li>Get specific. For instance, when weighing the place of a particular character trait in your own personal ethic, reflect on the ramifications of abandoning it altogether, consider what can be said against it, imagine what society would be like without it, etc.</li>
<li>Don't be noncommittal. Take a stand, stick your neck out, and engage in what John Herman Randall (in his book on Aristotle) called "the passionate search for passionless truth."</li>
</ul>
<p>Although these principles are admirable, it's hard to put them into practice!</p>

<h2><a href="1959.html">The Object of the Declaration</a></h2>
<h3>2025-05-08</h3>
<p>Exactly two hundred years ago today, Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to one Henry Lee, who had inquired about the genesis of the Declaration of Independence. Here is what Jefferson had to say (original spelling retained):</p>
<blockquote>That George Mason was author of the bill of rights, and of the constitution founded on it, the evidence of the day established fully in my mind. Of the paper you mention, purporting to be instructions to the Virginia delegation in Congress, I have no recollection. If it were any thing more than a projét of some private hand, that is to say, had any such instructions been ever given by the Convention, they would appear in the Journals, which we possess entire. But with respect to our rights and the acts of the British government contravening those rights, there was but one opinion on this side of the water. All American whigs thought alike on these subjects. When forced therefore to resort to arms for redress, an appeal to the tribunal of the world was deemed proper for our justification. This was the object of the Declaration of Independence. Not to find out new principles, or new arguments, never before thought of, not merely to say things which had never been said before; but to place before mankind the common sense of the subject, in terms so plain and firm, as to command their assent, and to justify ourselves in the independent stand we are compelled to take. Neither aiming at originality of principle or sentiment, nor yet copied from any particular and previous writing, it was intended to be an expression of the american mind, and to give to that expression the proper tone and spirit called for by the occasion. All its authority rests then on the harmonising sentiments of the day, whether expressed, in conversns in letters, printed essays or in the elementary books of public right, as Aristotle, Cicero, Locke, Sidney &amp;c. The historical documents which you mention as in your possession, ought all to be found, and I am persuaded you will find, to be corroborative of the facts and principles advanced in that Declaration.</blockquote>

<h2><a href="1958.html">Michelle Marder Kamhi, RIP</a></h2>
<h3>2025-05-03</h3>
<p>I was saddened to learn the other day that my friend and mentor Michelle Marder Kamhi has passed away. Chris Sciabarra has written a more complete remembrance of our mutual friend, so I will add only a few personal notes.</p>
<p>During my college years at Columbia University, I spent quite a bit of time with Michelle and her husband Lou Torres (whom I'd met even earlier when he gave a talk on art appreciation at the American Renaissance School). It was my good fortune to assist them with <em>Aristos</em>, the independent arts journal they published for many years. Michelle was ever gracious and considerate, interested in hearing my thoughts on a wide variety of topics, curious about my studies in philosophy and ancient Greek, and extremely kind to someone who was so young and inexperienced. Her knowledge of art history was immense, but even greater was her passion about the arts. Visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art with Michelle and Lou was an education unto itself! We also liked to walk from their brownstone on West 94th Street toward the Hudson River, where at Riverside Drive we would soak in the inspiring equine sculpture of Joan of Arc by Anna Hyatt Huntington. From Michelle and Lou I learned about so many artists I never would have encountered otherwise, and about the deep meaning and importance of art in human existence.</p>
<p>More recently, I helped Michelle and Lou to archive the <em>Aristos</em> website so that it will be available in perpetuity on the Internet. Even though at the time Michelle was struggling with the serious illness that would eventually take her life, she was characteristically and unfailingly gentle and patient. Michelle was a beautiful person and I will miss her very much.</p>
