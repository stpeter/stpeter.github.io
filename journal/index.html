<h2><a href="1856.html">Walking with Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics I.6</a></h2>
<h3>2024-03-29</h3>
<p>After the preliminaries in Nicomachean Ethics I.1-5, Aristotle considers a rather abstract question: is there some universal good or "Form of the Good" that is common to all good things? Aristotle's friends in Plato's Academy thought so, but in pursuit of truth Aristotle finds that he must disagree, for several reasons.</p>
<p>First, because "<em>good</em> is meant in as many ways as <em>being</em> is", we can't provide a unified account of the good that explains the goodness of entities that are inherently valuable (e.g., god), good qualities (e.g., the excellences of character), good amounts (e.g., the right level of wealth), good relations (e.g., the usefulness of a tool in relation to a given task), good occasions (e.g., the opportune moment to praise someone), good places (e.g., a dwelling), etc.</p>
<p>Second, if there were one Form of the Good then one kind of knowledge or understanding would encompass them all. However, in fact, the opportune moment (say) in war is studied by the craft of generalship, whereas in health it is studied by the craft of medicine.</p>
<p>Third, it's unclear how knowledge of the universal good (even if we could even acquire it) would actually help weavers or carpenters or doctors to better practice their craft; the gulf between the universal and the particular is too wide: a doctor treats human beings or a particular person, not "the good" in general.</p>
<p>In short, the universal good is not the kind of thing that a human being could know or do or have; what we are seeking is the highest good achievable through human action, not an abstraction beyond our ken. Although Aristotle has his unworldly moments, as we'll see, in general his inquiries stay grounded in human life and human experience. Good thing, too, because we're about to move on (in I.7) to a rather knotty line of reasoning about the characteristic activity or "task" of human beings...</p>

<h2><a href="1855.html">Walking with Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics I.1-5</a></h2>
<h3>2024-03-27</h3>
<p>Here in the late stages of preparation for writing my book <cite>Complete Yourself: Aristotle on Human Fulfillment</cite>, I've started a close re-reading of Aristotle's <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> (to be followed by a similar reading of his <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite>). Because it might prove useful both to myself and to others, I'll post notes on my readings as I go along, in a new series entitled "Walking with Aristotle".</p>
<p>In the first five chapters of Book I, Aristotle lays out some preliminary considerations for our journey with him.</p>
<p>First, what is the goal of our inquiry? It is to elucidate the highest good achievable through action, not merely in theory but also in practice so that we can become better human beings. And "everyone agrees" that this highest good is living well and acting well, which is the same thing as eudaimonia (commonly translated as "happiness", although I prefer "fulfillment").</p>
<p>Second, what level of precision should we expect from our inquiry? There is much disagreement and inconsistency about these matters (e.g., on its own wealth is a good thing, but depending on who has the money the result of great wealth could be a great evil). Thus the best we can do is to provide a rough outline of the highest good.</p>
<p>Third, in what direction will our journey proceed? We are travelling inductively from what's near and familiar to us toward the ultimate sources and principles of things, rather than deductively from the ultimate sources and principles toward what's near and familiar to us. Thus we'll judge theories based on the degree to which they accord with human actions and the human way of life, not judge human actions and the human way of life based on the degree to which they accord with some pre-existing theory.</p>
<p>Fourth, what kind of person is our ideal conversation partner? Someone who has a certain level of maturity (e.g., whose actions and commitments are guided by their best experiential understanding of human capacities and the highest good) and who cares to keep improving as a human being. Pointedly not someone who acts badly (e.g., who is pushed along by their every random feeling and impulse) and who needs to be convinced to become good, because the claims of wisdom have no hold on such a person.</p>
<p>Here Aristotle also introduces, almost by the way, a number of concepts that will loom large in our conversation with him (see my Aristotelian glossary for more about these terms):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Knowledge or understanding</li>
  <li>Capacities or powers</li>
  <li>Skills or crafts</li>
  <li>Beauty or rightness</li>
  <li>Choice or commitment</li>
  <li>Action or activity</li>
  <li>Reason or awareness</li>
  <li>Stable traits or qualities of a person</li>
  <li>Excellences or thrivings of character</li>
  <li>Habits or practices</li>
  <li>Completeness or perfection</li>
  <li>Living well or fulfillment</li>
</ul>
<p>He also briefly mentions four ways of life that the ancient Greeks traditionally considered and contrasted with each other: the lives of money-making, of pleasure and enjoyment, of honor and status through civic leadership, and of inquiry and contemplation.</p>
<p>We'll see how many of these ideas come together as we take this long walk with Aristotle.</p>

<h2><a href="1854.html">Nietzsche's Teachings</a></h2>
<h3>2024-03-26</h3>
<p>The other day a friend of mine asked me for my overall assessment of Friedrich Nietzsche. At first I jokingly replied that each of the seventy-two poems in my book <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite> might present a unique perspective, whereas all together they might not yield a unitary view. Then I decided to re-read the book, which led me to identify six main themes in what I take to be Nietzsche's positive philosophy of life:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Be radically honest with yourself, with the goal of enlightenment.</li>
  <li>Find your own truth, with the goal of liberation.</li>
  <li>Craft your own life, with the goal of independence.</li>
  <li>Cultivate what is near and dear, with the goal of simplicity.</li>
  <li>Be moderate and self-controlled, with the goal of tranquility.</li>
  <li>Pursue work over happiness, with the goal of greatness.</li>
</ol>
<p>There's a reason, perhaps, why the two words most often rhymed in these poems are "soul" and "goal", for it strikes me that Nietzsche's overarching message is the deep significance of self-mastery.</p>

<h2><a href="1853.html">Work as a Gift</a></h2>
<h3>2024-03-11</h3>
<p>While reading British anthropologist Alan Macfarlane's fascinating book <cite>Japan through the Looking Glass</cite> recently, I was introduced to a conception of economic interaction almost entirely different from that in the West:</p>
<blockquote>Working for an employer is seen as a gift of one's labour and the wages are the return of the gift. The Japanese word for salary is <em>roku</em>, which means 'gift'.... [Macfarlane's friend Toshiko Nakamura] enlightened us further. Payments for goods and those for services are considered to be totally different things in Japan, she said. Up to the nineteenth century school fees were not an obligatory but a voluntary payment, usually made in goods rather than money.... There are still a lot of 'voluntary' fees in Japan. Toshiko's sister-in-law teaches piano but finds it nearly impossible to ask for payment and relies on the parents of her students to do the honourable thing. Often when fees are paid, presents are also given at certain times of year which underlines the idea of payment as a 'gift'. Thus fee payment is part of a social relationship, not a cold economic transaction.</blockquote>
<p>Although I had only glimmers of that attitude during my business career - mostly at one technology firm that felt almost like a family - now that I'm freed from need and can collaborate only with people whose company I enjoy, my work feels much more like a gift. Sometimes I even receive a gift in return, as I was delighted to do today from my friend Christoph Kerschbaumer in return for my help with editing his excellent new book <cite>Beyond the Code: Setting You up for Success as a Software Engineer</cite>.</p>

<h2><a href="1852.html">A Plague on Both Your Houses!</a></h2>
<h3>2024-03-07</h3>
<p>We all know the story of Romeo and Juliet, that pair of star-crossed lovers who through a series of mishaps and misunderstandings end up committing suicide. Yet amidst the tragedy and the romance we pay less attention to the civic background: duelling families whose constant strife seriously jeopardizes the peace in the Verona of old. Both the prince and the people are fed up with the Capulets and the Montagues; in Shakespeare's rendering, when the prince's kinsman Mercutio is mortally albeit unintentionally wounded by Romeo in yet another street fight, he cries out "a plague on both your houses!"</p>
<p>I suspect this is how many Americans feel about the Democrats and Republicans. Here in Colorado, nearly half of registered voters are independent, yet by design our options at the ballot box are pretty much limited to the two big parties, which in turn are beholden to their least moderate elements. Both locally and nationally, neither party wants to work with their enemies across the aisle, fingerpointing and backstabbing are the order of the day, and good governance is merely a fond wish (why solve any problems when you can use the lack of solutions to rile up your base?). And here we are again with a "choice" between Trump and Biden, whose "leadership" has been rivalled in American history only by the incompetent presidents of the 1850s. It's no wonder that some folks speculate (without justification, in my view) about a coming civil war.</p>
<p>Although I am far from having the answers, I do think political moderation and acting locally are two important pieces of the puzzle, which each of us can pursue both individually and in our own communities. If more people reflect on our situation and decide to model reasonable civic-mindedness, perhaps together we can pull ourselves back from the brink.</p>
