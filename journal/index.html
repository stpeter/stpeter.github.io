<h2><a href="1950.html">Where I Stand</a></h2>
<h3>2025-04-08</h3>
<p>Spurred by Garry Kasparov's call for a positive vision of the free society, Arnold Kling posted a list of the causes he is for. It seems like a good idea to reflect on these matters from time to time - perhaps especially at this time. Therefore - while recognizing both that I'm politically powerless and that my views have significance only for me - here I'll very briefly set out ten principles that I hold to be important in the political realm.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ethics. My ideal president is George Washington, a leader who had the highest principles of personal conduct along with an unwavering devotion to public service.</li>
  <li>Freedom. The American ideals espoused in the Declaration of Independence are eminently worth preserving, fighting for, and extending to more aspects of our society.</li>
  <li>Opportunity. Too many Americans have precious little opportunity to advance in life because of horrendous schools, unsafe neighborhoods, welfare programs that actively discourage moving up into the middle class, etc. We pay lip service to addressing these problems, but to our shame we haven't made real progress.</li>
  <li>Flourishing. A flourishing society requires flourishing individuals, families, and communities - in other words, prioritizing the general welfare, not demagogues, oligarchs, and special interests.</li>
  <li>Moderation. Aristotle said that law is reason codified, and that those who rule must be servants and protectors of the laws. This requires not only the ability to reason well about the common good, but a dedication to being reasonable.</li>
  <li>Effective governance. Our system of government has become ineffective at all levels, but especially at the federal level. Governments are trying to do too many things - and doing a poor job on most of them. We could use a lot more of Adam Smith's "peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice".</li>
  <li>Federalism and localism. To be effective, governance should happen much closer to the people. All functions except those explicitly ceded to the federal government in the Constitution should be performed by states, cities, towns, counties, neighborhoods, and voluntary associations of all kinds.</li>
  <li>Pluralism. From the very beginning, America has contained many different regions, ethnicities, religions, ideologies, and cultures. Like a jazz big band, these different "sections" come together to make beautiful but sometimes cacaphonous music. Let's cherish and nurture it.</li>
  <li>Brotherhood. We Americans are all in this together; despite our differences, we should have a common regard for each other and a common commitment to the never-ending mission of realizing our American ideals in practice.</li>
  <li>A free world. It's a legacy of our revolution that America has always been a beacon of freedom; we should live up to that promise by working with our friends and allies around the globe and by welcoming law-abiding, freedom-loving people from all over the world to join the American project.</li>
</ol>
<p>At least that's how I see things now...</p>

<h2><a href="1949.html">Talking vs. Thinking</a></h2>
<h3>2025-04-07</h3>
<p>A friend and I have begun a pair reading of <cite>The Faith of a Heretic</cite> by Walter Kaufmann. It's the second time through for both of us and we have mutual admiration for Kaufmann, so we're excited about digging into this most personal of Kaufmann's books on philosophy and religion.</p>
<p>Here in the early going, I was struck by this paragraph in a section on intellectual honesty:</p>
<blockquote>Perhaps the single best example of the common lack of high standards in questions of honesty is our tendency to think in labels. Terms like existentialism, pragmatism, and empiricism, liberalism and conservatism are, more often than not, so many excuses for not considering individual ideas on their merits and for not exposing oneself to the bite of thought. For less educated people, words like Jew and Catholic, Democrat, Republican, and Communist do much the same job. These labels have some uses that are perfectly legitimate, but frequently they function as an aid to thoughtlessness and permit people to appear to <em>think</em> when they are merely talking.</blockquote>
<p>There's an awful lot of "merely talking" in the world, isn't there? In my life I've been just as guilty as the next person, but I've been striving to leave labels, isms, epithets, and slogans behind me. It's surprisingly hard work!</p>
<p>One of my methods is what I call encountering - deeply reading and considering the complete works of particular thinkers from the past. A good example is Thoreau. Having read everything he wrote, I have to wonder: Was Thoreau a transcendentalist? What does the label even mean? Could it be that, despite some similarities (what Wittgenstein might call "family resemblances"), lumping Thoreau in together with Kant, Fichte, Schelling, Swedenborg, Böhme, Carlyle, Coleridge, and the like actually lessens our understanding of Thoreau's individuality and multifarious insights?</p>
<p>Although encountering in my sense is a number of steps beyond steelmanning, unfortunately it takes extreme discipline and dedication - one might have time for only half a dozen encounters in life. I'm hopeful that Kaufmann's example and suggestions might help me discover thinking practices that aren't quite so intensive.</p>

<h2><a href="1948.html">Aristotle on Freedom</a></h2>
<h3>2025-03-31</h3>
<p>As mentioned two weeks ago in my note "Translation as Thinking", the concepts used across time and space (and, even, across writers) can vary quite significantly in the meanings they capture. This is especially true regarding concepts that are rather vague in the first place, such as virtue, happiness, democracy, and - the subject of today's post - freedom.</p>
<p>Although I'm far from the first to observe that the ancients thought differently about liberty and freedom than we moderns do - Benjamin Constant gave a famous talk on the topic over two hundred years ago - recently I've been struck by how foreign to us the classical Greek conceptions really are. While translating Aristotle's short "handout" <cite>On Thrivings and Failings of Character</cite>, I struggled to render the Greek word ἐλευθεριότης; the sense is wider than the usual Englishing of "generosity", whereas "liberality" sounds somewhat old-fashioned. So I looked up "liberal" in my 1828 edition of Webster's dictionary and struck paydirt on the first definition: "free of heart". That captures it perfectly, because ἐλευθεριότης is derived from the Greek word for freedom: ἐλευθερία.</p>
<p>Yet what did those old Greeks mean by freedom and free-heartedness? They definitely did not mean complete license to do whatever one pleases, for which they had a different word: ἐξουσία. Indeed, in Book XII of the <cite>Metaphysics</cite> Aristotle makes a passing remark that the freeborn members of an ancient Greek household were least at liberty to act as chance may have it, since their actions had to be well-ordered toward the common goals and common good of household management (οἰκονομία - whence our word "economics").</p>
<p>This idea that "something one and common is the work of all" figures prominently when Aristotle talks about social animals like bees, ants, and humans (the quote is from the <cite>Historia Animalium</cite>). In the historical context of classical Greece, where warfare between city-states was endemic, the primary common goal was simple survival and independence, because being conquered by another polis meant death or enslavement for the citizens. This is a core meaning of the word freedom in English, too: to be free means that you and your friends and frithmates are not in thrall to some other group but can control your group's destiny.</p>
<p>Yet Aristotle argues that mere survival is not the highest goal: we want not merely to live, but to live <em>well</em>. Because war is for the sake of peace and work is for the sake of leisure, military and productive activities are secondary to more glorious pursuits like wisdom, learning, conversation, music, dancing, poetry, art, religious festivals, athletic games, and all the other pastimes we humans have created to celebrate life.</p>
<p>This is why, according to Aristotle, free-hearted people are not only generous in our modern sense of charity (derived in large measure from Christian ethics), but also spend lavishly on necessities, delight in beauty, liberally express their love for family and friends and fellow citizens, and achieve quialities like adaptability, kindness, compassion, goodwill, and mutual understanding.</p>
<p>Thus we can see that for Aristotle and the ancient Greeks more generally, freedom meant being a well-ordered person whose internal harmony shone outward into harmonious relations with other people and the world at large. These insights explain a perhaps otherwise cryptic remark in <cite>On Thrivings and Failings of Character</cite>: "a person in seriously excellent condition is a model for a well-governed society." But perhaps not so cryptic after all, because a similar premise lies at the base of Plato's <cite>Republic</cite> and the entire Socratic tradition of classical philosophy.</p>
<p>At root, I would say, Aristotelian freedom is the capacity - perhaps even the capaciousness of mind and heart - to consistently act for the sake of what is beautiful in life. Although we hear an echo of this noble vision in Jefferson's "pursuit of happiness" (properly understood), it seems to me that we frivolous denizens of the twenty-first century no longer understand the depth, seriousness, and greatness that true freedom once implied, both personally and societally. The loss is ours.</p>

<h2><a href="1947.html">A Signal Failure</a></h2>
<h3>2025-03-30</h3>
<p>It's rare that I comment on day-to-day political happenings. Not only are they quite distressing of late, but in general I prefer to read not the Times but the Eternities, as Thoreau said. However, the recent kerfuffle regarding use of the Signal messaging app by Trump administration officials is too tempting a target, because I worked on secure messaging systems for 25+ years and can offer some insights.</p>
<p>The messaging technology I worked on started out as the Jabber open-source project in 1999 and was standardized at the Internet Engineering Task Force under the acronym XMPP in 2004. In fact, I authored the documentation, codified in RFC 3920 and RFC 3921 (updated by RFC 6120 and RFC 6121 in 2011). Once this protocol was published as an industry standard, it was widely deployed within the U.S. government, NATO, etc. The beauty of XMPP is that anyone can run their own server with their own access control policies. As an example, the U.S. Department of Defense ran an XMPP service on their own secret communications network and used DoD "common access cards" for authentication. As a result, only DoD employees could use the service.</p>
<p>By contrast, although Signal is a fine consumer-oriented app with strong security and a friendly onboarding process and all that, pretty much anyone can create a Signal account. As a result, it's possible for senior administration officials to invite journalists to their chat groups, which would have been impossible if said officials had been using a government-run XMPP service instead.</p>
<p>Of course, this all assumes that the U.S. government is still running internal XMPP services (I'm no longer in the loop on such things) and, even more challenging, assumes that administration officials would give up their consumer apps in favor of internal messaging systems running on secret communication networks. That would be the responsible thing to do, but responsibility seems to be in short supply these days...</p>

<h2><a href="1946.html">Translating as Thinking</a></h2>
<h3>2025-03-17</h3>
<p>As noted as far back as 2016, I've been ruminating for years about how to render certain key terms of Aristotle's philosophy from ancient Greek into English. To date, the only outcome has been a glossary that I update regularly as I add more definitions and polish the existing ones. Recently I lighted upon a constructive way to put some of these renderings to the test: by translating a brief Aristotelian work whose title is usually presented as <cite>On Virtues and Vices</cite>.</p>
<p>Although most scholars consider this work to be spurious - at best written by an Aristotelian but not by Aristotle himself - in 2013 Peter L.P. Simpson published a paper making a plausible case that the work was a kind of handout used during Aristotle's lecture courses, since it matches the description of something cited in the <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite>. Duly encouraged, I decided to attempt a translation, which I ended up titling <cite>On Thrivings and Failings of Character</cite>.</p>
<p>The process was interesting and beneficial, at least for me - similar in some ways to running a unit test in computer programming. Just as writing is a form of thinking, so also is translating. If we envision a big field containing a whole lot of meaning, no one word can cover the entire field; that's one reason why in English we have so many synonyms. Things get even more interesting as you think through the overlapping ways that a word in ancient Greek covers part of the ground while a word in modern English covers some but not all of the very same ground. (And that's even leaving aside trying to honor the style and feeling of the original, as I've essayed when translating poems by the likes of Sappho and Horace, with varying levels of success.)</p>
<p>A notorious example is the ancient Greek word sōphrosunē / σωφροσύνη, which was sort of a catch-all concept in classical philosophy and culture, with meanings as diverse as moderation, temperance, self-control, self-knowledge, soundness of mind, balance, reasonableness, wisdom, prudence, virtue, even chastity. Classicist Helen North wrote a whole book about this one word! (For the record, I've settled on rendering σωφροσύνη as 'moderation'.)</p>
<p>Another factor I keep firmly in mind is the great cultural chasm between classical Athens and modern America. Although people often say that ancient Greece was the fountainhead of democracy and Western culture, it's also true that "the past is a foreign country", as David Lowenthal put it. For us, words like 'virtue' and 'soul' are weighted down with Christian theology, and we don't even use words like 'vice' and 'evil' anymore because that would be too judgmental. Thus my creativity with thrivings and failings instead of virtues and vices.</p>
<p>Translating this short piece (it's less than 2000 words in English) helped me work out some bugs in my glossary and better understand Aristotle's viewpoint, so I might try my hand at passages that include key concepts I didn't hit this time around, from works of Aristotle's like the <cite>Metaphysics</cite>, <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>, <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite>, and his early and mostly lost dialogue <cite>Protrepticus</cite>. If I do so, I'll definitely report on the results.</p>

<h2><a href="1945.html">The Divinity of Being</a></h2>
<h3>2025-03-15</h3>
<p>While continuing my travels in the land of Aristotle (specifically, entering passages from his Metaphysics into my digital commonplace book), I chanced recently upon the shoreline of the vast ocean of theology. Knowing that I would quickly drown if I ventured too far from shore, I merely picked up a few seashells, waded in up to my knees, and enjoyed the view of the endless depths. Even though these are mostly uncharted waters for me (despite a few related posts almost twenty years ago), I'll give a short report on my excursion.</p>
<p>Medieval theology produced a large number of arguments for the existence of god. Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas, Duns Scotus, Maimonides, and others applied their great minds to the task. After first assuming an individual divinity, they attempted to prove its being.</p>
<p>Yet if we undergo a kind of religious inversion, we can adopt a very different perspective: first we accept being and then we try to understand its divine aspects. This is not pantheism or even panentheism, but a two-fold amazement at the fact of existence and the fact that we have awareness of it.</p>
<p>Aristotle scholar Aryeh Kosman spelled out this inversion in his book <cite>The Activity of Being</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>Instead of imagining ourselves discovering what is divine and then coming to see it as the principle of being - of <em>ousia</em> - think instead of coming to see that which is the principle of being as, just because it is the principle of being, divine.... Instead of imagining a cardinal feature of god as awareness, think instead of coming to see the principle of the awareness that we have of the world - of the consciousness that we know as <em>nous</em> - as for that very reason divine.</blockquote>
<p>Here we can glimpse a radically naturalistic standpoint on the divine. There's a passage in the Metaphysics that points in this direction:</p>
<blockquote>If the divine being is always in this condition that we sometimes are, that is to be wondered at; and if it is in it to a greater degree than we are, that is to be wondered at still more. (1072b24-26)</blockquote>
<p>What Aristotle seems to be doing here is extrapolating from our human moments of highest awareness - of <em>theoria</em> - to the life of a being that could enjoy such awareness not as an occasional "peak experience" but as an endless, continuous activity. Then he concludes: wow, <em>that</em> would be a god if anything could be!</p>
<p>Another way to think about it was identified by Hannah Arendt in her book <cite>The Life of the Mind</cite>: the god of the philosophers is not Zeus (or Yahweh or Allah or Shiva or even Zarathustra), but Being itself. This new god launches a revolution in which myth is replaced by reason, theology by ontology, religion by philosophy.</p>
<p>Yet fomenting revolution is a dangerous business. Recall that Socrates was condemned to death on two counts: corrupting the youth and inventing a new god. The latter is usually interpreted as referring to the inner voice - or <em>daimonion</em> - that warned Socrates away from doing the wrong thing, but perhaps the unknown god that spoke to him was this new god of the philosophers.</p>
<p>It's something to wonder about, for sure...</p>
