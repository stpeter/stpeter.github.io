<h2><a href="1981.html">Imitation and Individuality</a></h2>
<h3>2025-08-20</h3>
<blockquote>All art is only done by the individual. The individual is all you ever have and all schools only serve to classify their members as failures. ~ Ernest Hemingway, <cite>Death in the Afternoon</cite>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Anybody can write like somebody else, but it takes a long time to get to write like yourself... ~ Ernest Hemingway, <cite>"Notes on Life and Letters"</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>These propositions, quoted in Albert Murray's book <cite>The Blue Devils of Nada</cite>, "preclude imitation in favor of individuality", as Murray observes. Here I'm especially interested in Hemingway's statement that schools of art <em>serve to classify their members as failures</em>. What exactly does that mean?</p>
<p>My interpretation is that schools of art - and, I might add, schools of philosophy - set forth theoretical archetypes for what a person is to create or how a person is to live. Too often, the leaders - and sometimes especially the followers - within a school or movement judge others for falling short of the ideal, for building things not defined in the blueprint, for creating and living in ways that aren't according to plan.</p>
<p>Yet the artist, the thinker, the individual human being exists not to follow the rules or paint within the lines, but to experience life completely and then out of that experience to shape something meaningful.</p>
<p>To be clear, this fundamental personalism does not exclude the possibility and often the necessity of collaboration, interaction, and interdependence: writers work with editors and publishers, playwrights work with actors and directors, sculptors work with foundries and gallery owners, composers work with performers, and so on. But at their best all of these folks work together as creative individuals, not as interchangeable representatives or enforcers of some constraining ideology.</p>

<h2><a href="1980.html">Thinking Historically</a></h2>
<h3>2025-08-16</h3>
<blockquote>Historians have a heavy responsibility not merely to teach people substantive historical truths but also to teach them how to think historically. ~ David Hackett Fischer</blockquote>
<p>Over the last few months I've read three books by my favorite historian, David Hackett Fischer: <cite>Historians' Fallacies: Toward a Logic of Historical Thought</cite> (1970), <cite>Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America</cite> (my third reading of this book, published in 1989), and <cite>African Founders: How Enslaved People Expanded American Ideals</cite> (2022).</p>
<p>Focusing here only on his methodology and not on the "substantive historical truths" he has revealed, Fischer sees himself as an empiricist, who strives to avoid the many misuses of history by asking open-ended questions that can be answered through well-reasoned explanations of judiciously selected facts about the human past.</p>
<p>Although an empirical approach to history sounds straightforwardly scientific, Fischer's copious catalogue of fallacies indicates that it's quite difficult to achieve: all too many historians twist the facts, ask inherently unanswerable questions, tell just-so stories, entertain without edifying, glorify or rebuke those who lived before our time, grind ideological or activist axes, etc.</p>
<p>Yet the longer I live and reflect, the more I appreciate the importance of historical knowledge in understanding "present trends and future tendencies" (Fischer 1970, p. 136). Every society has problems, and history can help us see them for what they are; it can also help us see the range of potential solutions (or, as Bertrand de Jouvenel said, the range of provisional "settlements" - for no societal problem is ever truly <em>solved</em>, since settlements necessarily involve what Thomas Sowell called "tradeoffs" and those can change over time in various ways). Specifically, historical insights can help us see which settlements and tradeoffs might be most workable in our present context - by asking questions such as this one from Fischer: "what, for example, are the historical conditions in which social stability, social freedom, and social equality have tended to be maximally coexistent?" (Fischer 1970, p. 315).</p>
<p>The foregoing uses of history are quite substantial, but it is another use that I find most meaningful: "historical scholarship can usefully serve to help us find out who we are" (ibid.). This use of history has its roots in ancient Greek historians like Herodotus, Thucydides, and Dionysius of Halicarnasus - who said that "history is philosophy teaching by examples". Fischer takes this to mean that historians should sit in judgment over people in the past, but he misunderstands what the Greeks meant by philosophy as the love of wisdom and the pursuit of self-knowledge (the famous γνῶθι σαυτόν from the temple of Apollo at Delphi). Indeed, this is just the kind of historical insight that Fischer excels at, especially in <cite>Albion's Seed</cite> and <cite>African Founders</cite>, which have helped me and no doubt thousands of others to understand America in its complexity, its high ideals, its repeated failings, and its ever-present potential for renewal and reform.</p>
<p>Ironically, Fischer is quite critical of anything like a philosophical approach to history, but I'm out of words for today so I'll have to write about that some other time.</p>

<h3>2025-08-15</h3>
<p>Here's something I'm struggling with: if talk is cheap and values are overrated, what's the worth of writing?</p>
<p>For various reasons, I find I have less to say these days, as I focus on the personal world of family, friends, colleagues, neighbors, and some music composition projects I'm working on. Yes, I'm still reading voraciously in and about history, literature, philosophy, music, etc. - and talking about these readings with a few friends - but I seem less inclined to write about these matters. One possibility is that I'm merely waiting for my reflections to gestate into something worth publishing; alternatively, perhaps I'm moving more in the direction of thinkers like Socrates and Pyrrho who never wrote anything at all. Time will tell.</p>
<p>In the meantime, posting might be more sporadic than usual.</p>

<h2><a href="1978.html">Personal World</a></h2>
<h3>2025-08-04</h3>
<p>Back in May, Discourse magazine published a fine essay by Martin Gurri entitled "My Moral Sphere". Consistent with my own stance toward life, Gurri argued that ethics is not what you profess about national or global issues, but how you treat the people around you. Here's his summary:</p>
<blockquote>My moral sphere is a small world, a limited space. The necessary virtues aren't complex: <em>humility</em> with my family, <em>integrity</em> at work, <em>neighborliness</em> in my community - add <em>loyalty</em> to friends, and one has the basic package.</blockquote>
<p>Although I might modify or expand his list, the core focus seems right to me. My moral sphere is a <em>personal world</em>, filled with individuals whom I endeavor to treat with dignity, respect, kindness, and love. It sounds so simple, yet anyone who has had to deal with a disruptive neighbor, backstabbing co-worker, abusive family member, or false friend knows that the personal world is the hardest of all.</p>

<h2><a href="1977.html">Values Are Overrated</a></h2>
<h3>2025-07-31</h3>
<p>Modern society is filled with incessant talk about the importance of good values. Yet talk is cheap and values are overrated. Much more important than values are commitments, practices, and actions.</p>
<p>To choose a few examples: it's easy for me to <em>say</em> that I value human freedom, interpersonal empathy, aesthetic excellence, and intellectual honesty. Yet am I deeply committed to those things? Have I built up practices for achieving them? Do I consistently take action to bring them into reality?</p>
<p>Inevitably, so much of what I read online is just words, words, words. And, to be clear, I'm as guilty as the rest! But if the unit of greatness in philosophy is a life, then whatever values I voice pale in comparison to the commitments I put into practice through recurrent actions in the context of both my long-term projects and my relationships with family, friends, workmates, and neighbors. Most everything else is, as Shakespeare said, sound and fury, signifying nothing.</p>

<h3>2025-07-21</h3>
<p>A recent essay by Fasil Merawi about Ethiopian philosophy set me to thinking (and to ordering a copy of the <cite>Hatatas</cite>). According to Merawi, there are two opposing philosophical camps in Ethiopia:</p>
<blockquote>The universalist camp charges the Africanists with blurring the distinction between the study of culture and the study of philosophy by trying to reduce philosophy into an ethnophilosophy (that is, the body of beliefs of a particular culture, usually indigenous, which is regarded as the expression of the collected beliefs of all the members of a given community and can be applied to the present moment without any change). In response, the Africanists see the universalists as worshipping the Eurocentric metaphysical structure and thereby losing sight of what it means to practise philosophy from a specifically African, Ethiopian and intercultural vantage point.</blockquote>
<p>The universalists seek insights that apply to all people and the "groupists" seek insights that apply to some people. However, both camps are missing a third alternative: the personalist seeks insights that apply to one person, i.e., the self.</p>
<p>Naturally, there is something universal about the quest for self-knowledge, since it figures prominently in most philosophical traditions (Greek, Chinese, Indian, etc.). And, because every person can be seen as a member of many groups (ethnic, national, generational, professional, etc.), understanding those group identities is a significant aspect of knowing oneself. Yet ultimately it is you as an individual who must sift through universal and group insights - and understand the identities of other people, too - in order to (as Plato put it in the <cite>Laches</cite>) formulate an account of your own life. <em>The unit of greatness in philosophy is a life.</em></p>
