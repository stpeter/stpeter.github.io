<h2><a href="1918.html">Walking with Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics X.1-5</a></h2>
<h3>2024-11-07</h3>
<p>In X.1-5 Aristotle revisits the topic of pleasure, reiterating some of the points he made in VII.11-14 (e.g., that every activity has its own inherent pleasure) but also extending them in several ways.</p>
<p>Aristotle presents evidence indicating that the enjoyment of an activity <em>completes</em> [τελειοῖ / teleioi] that activity. When we perceive with the senses or conceive with the mind, we are most completely active or "at work" if we are engaged with the most beautiful [καλός / kalos] and serious [σπουδαῖος / spoudaios] objects of awareness. The reason seems to be that we enjoy both the active <em>being</em> of what we perceive/conceive (say, the aliveness of a bird in flight) and our own active <em>awareness</em> of what we perceive/conceive. Although Aristotle doesn't put it quite this way, we could say that enjoyment is a form of awareness: it consists in awareness of the world and (since, as we saw in IX.9-12, for human beings living simply <em>is</em> perceiving and thinking) awareness of our own aliveness.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because pleasures are bound up with the activities they complete, they in turn are brought to completion in ways that correspond to the activities: the inherent [οἰκείος / oikeios] pleasures of sight differ from those of hearing or taste or touch, the pleasures of the mind differ from those of the senses, there are various pleasures of the mind (e.g., recollecting, imagining, hoping, learning, contemplating), etc. Thus pleasures are not interchangeable but deserve to be valued and pursued in ways that do justice to the nature of the underlying activities.</p>
<p>Based on these factors, Aristotle argues that the most complete activity is the most enjoyable: for instance, it's more pleasurable to deeply understand a significant concept than to become acquainted with p a trivial fact, or to witness a seriously worthy person performing a beautifully right action than to witness a worthless, morally corrupt person performing a repulsively ugly action. Naturally, there are many kinds of corruption and damage that human beings can experience, but corrupt/damaged people and their feelings and pleasures are not the standard of value in human life. Instead, the measure [κανόν / kanon] of what is truly enjoyable is the kind of person who is completely developed, mature, serious, worthy, good, beautifully right, wise, sagacious, fulfilled, etc.</p>
<p>These considerations lead up to Aristotle's final integrations in the remainder of Book X.</p>

<h2><a href="1917.html">Walking with Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics IX.9-12</a></h2>
<h3>2024-11-03</h3>
<p>In IX.9-12, Aristotle finishes off his consideration of love and friendship by wondering how many close relationships one really needs, the times in life when such relationships are most valuable, etc.</p>
<p>The first question is whether the person who leads a life of fulfillment (εὐδαιμονία / eudaimonia) needs any friends at all. One of the conditions for fulfillment, discussed in I.7, is that the complete good is characterized by αὐτάρκεια / autarkeia, typically rendered as "self-sufficiency" although I prefer "wholeness". Aristotle points out that it's absurd to say the fulfilled person wouldn't need close relationships, because we think such a person has all good things and loved ones are the greatest of external goods. The reason is that human beings are inherently social and we're naturally made for sharing the activities of life [συζήν / suzēn] with other people. Indeed, we can be more continuously [συνεχῶς / sunechōs] active if we are active with others; since fulfillment consists of activity [ἐνέργεια / energeia], and since activity consistent with core human capacities and directed by thriving of character is both beautifully right and enjoyable, the more active we are the more fulfilled we are. Thus the person who takes life seriously needs loved ones who are just as serious [σπουδαῖος / spoudaios].</p>
<p>Furthermore, because for human beings living in the most authoritative sense simply <em>is</em> awareness [ἄισθησις / aisthesis] and thinking [νοήσις / noēsis], sharing the activities of life consists most of all in conversing [λόγος / logos] together and thinking things through [διανοία / dianoia] together.</p>
<p>Yet we can't expect to build close relationships with very many people; going through life together might not be completely exclusive, but it's a rather special state of affairs. Indeed, Aristotle notes that the celebrated friendships are all pairs - say, Achilles and Patroklus in the Iliad or, to choose a slightly more modern example, Michel de Montaigne and Étienne de La Boétie as recounted in Montaigne's essay <cite>Of Friendship</cite>. We're fortunate to find even a few such friends in life, perhaps only one.</p>
<p>Although we say that "a friend in need is a friend indeed", Aristotle says that it's more beautifully right [καλός / kalos] to share in good fortune than in bad fortune, because as mentioned in IX.4-7 success enables us to demonstrate in "well-action" [εὐέργεται / euergetai] that we stand in a relation of "well-mindedness" [εὐνοία / eunoia] toward our friends.</p>
<p>Finally, Aristotle observes that whatever we think are the essential activities of life are the ones that we prefer to pursue with those who are dear to us: athletes exercise together, musicians make music together, philosophers philosophize together, etc. Moreover, these activities have a reinforcing effect: if the activities are bad then they further corrupt the people who engage in them, whereas if the activities are good then by putting the friendship into action [ἐνεργοῦντες / energountes] the friends straighten each other out [διορθοῦντες / diorthountes] and thus become better together. This ethical component is a big reason why <em>philia</em> was valued so highly in ancient Greece.</p>
<p>Thus we come to the end of Aristotle's analysis of love and friendship. We have one more book of the Nicomachean Ethics to cover in our walk with Aristotle, starting with his second discussion of pleasure and enjoyment in X.1-5.</p>

<h2><a href="1916.html">Walking with Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics IX.8</a></h2>
<h3>2024-10-29</h3>
<p>Up until now Aristotle has considered love for other people, but in IX.8 Aristotle asks some probing questions about love of self. All the central qualities of love (summarized in my post about IX.4-7) seem to apply most of all to oneself, such that love toward others seems to grow out of self-love. But how can this be? After all, it also seems that the unserious/unworthy [phaulos] person whose character is corrupted [mochthēros] acts out of pure selfishness. The conflict between these appearances sets up what Aristotle calls an impasse [aporia], and we'll need to find a way through it in order to make further progress toward wisdom and sagacity.</p>
<p>Harkening back to distinctions he introduced in I.8, Aristotle claims that the unserious person succumbs to greed [pleonexia] regarding the kinds of external goods that people fight over: wealth, fame, honor, power, and so on. By constrast, the person who takes life seriously cultivates internal goods like character, knowledge, and wisdom. Because these internal goods are the most beautifully right things in life, the person who is especially serious [spoudaios] about them goes after the very best things and therefore has the highest degree of self-love. Although we don't happen to call such a person a self-lover, in fact that's what he or she is.</p>
<p>Moreoever, it is beautifully right actions that gratify the most authoritative [kurios] part of the soul, which is the mind; as a result, the serious person's doings and feelings are suffused with thinking [meta logou] and the correct account [orthos logos] of human life. Thus the person who takes life seriously experiences inner harmony, whereas the unserious, unworthy person experiences disharmony and constant regrets over doing what ought not to be done.</p>
<p>Finally (although Aristotle doesn't spell it out fully here), the person who engages in the thoroughgoing love and practice of what's beautifully right inherently values and enacts what is most to be loved and cherished [philētos] in life - the very concept he introduced as of paramount importance at the beginning of his discussion of <em>philia</em> in VIII.1. Therefore if we're seeking a relationship based on character rather than use or pleasure, the true self-lover makes for the best friend, whereas the false self-lover is poor material indeed.</p>

<h2><a href="1915.html">Walking with Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics IX.4-7</a></h2>
<h3>2024-10-26</h3>
<p>In his translation of the Nicomachean Ethics, Joe Sachs notes that at IX.4 Aristotle turns away from the factors that cause certain relationships to fall short or fall apart and instead turns toward the central factors that unify the experience of <em>philia</em>. These include: loving someone for their own sake, wishing that they might have all good things in life, actually doing or giving some of those good things for them, wanting them to live and to live well, wishing to spend time together and share in the activities of life, valuing the same things, sharing in the joys and sorrows of life, etc.</p>
<p>Once again, Aristotle observes that mothers feel and do these things most of all; yet he further observes that the humane person who takes life seriously also feels and does these things with regard to himself. The reason is that such a person has internal agreement [homognōmonei = "knowing alike"] and consistently reaches out for the same things throughout life. This consistency is directed by his entire soul and is pursued for the sake of his thinking activity [nooun] or the thinking part of the soul [dianoētikos] - for <em>this</em> seems most of all to be a person and this most especially needs to be maintained and preserved (recall Aristotle's discussion in III.10-12 of sōphrosunē, which literally means "mind-keeping").</p>
<p>In IX.5 and IX.6, Aristotle discusses two of the main ingredients for close relationships: well-mindedness [eunoia, usually rendered "goodwill"] and like-mindedness [homonoia]. Note the connection between these terms and the Greek word for mind [nous]. It's almost as if those who are dear to each other share the same mind across two bodies. That's not really the case, of course; but according to Aristotle it is our mind and thoughts, including well-mindedness and like-mindedness, that figure centrally in love and friendship.</p>
<p>Like-mindedness is not the mere holding of similar opinions [homodoxia] about any arbitrary topic, such as one might find among scientists or co-religionists or political partisans. Instead, it involves having common goals, forming similar judgments, making similar choices, and acting on those choices together. This leads naturally to one of the most important aspects of <em>philia</em>: taking action for the sake of someone who is dear to you, which in VIII.6-8 he called the activity [energeia] of loving [philein] and which here he calls doing favors [euergetai, literally "well-acting"). It is through activity that we are what we are, and the person who acts well for the sake of someone they love creates something beautifully right [kalos] through this kind of activity (1168a10).</p>
<p>All of this shows that love [philia] is not only a feeling [pathos], but also a complete activity [energeia] and thriving [aretē] of the whole person. That's likely why Aristotle thought it was important to devote 20% of the Nicomachean Ethics to the topic.</p>

<h2><a href="1914.html">A Visit to the Dentist</a></h2>
<h3>2024-10-25</h3>
<p>During a visit to the dentist the other day, I experimented with what I recently called radical gratitude. Throughout the visit, I asked myself: how much of what I experienced could I perceive as a gift to be enjoyed and appreciated? (To be clear, I actually like going to the dentist, so this wasn't as much of a stretch for me as it might be for others.)</p>
<p>Well, it really is endless! Here are some aspects I observed:</p>
<ul>
<li>I was breathing and alive the whole time. ;-)</li>
<li>I was able to get to the appointment on my own, which means I still have my wits about me.</li>
<li>I drove there in my own car, which subsumes a massive number of affordances, technologies, customs, institutions, and achievements: cars and their many subsystems (engines, brakes, wheels, airbags, etc.), roads built and maintained, traffic signals, licensing of drivers, insurance, rules of the road, ownership, having earned enough money in life to buy a car, etc.</li>
<li>The same goes for the physical office: the building in which it's housed with all its various subsystems (heating, plumbing, lighting, elevators, etc.), ownership and leasing and financing and the like, etc.</li>
<li>The dental practice: the friendly ladies at the front desk, the hygienists, the dentist herself, the training of these folks in the craft of dentistry, the business of such a practice (encompassing incorporation, ownership, payroll, insurance, marketing, policies and procedures, office culture, etc.).</li>
<li>The tools of the trade: those special dental chairs, lights, implements, X-ray machines, etc. - think of the work that goes into creating and producing all of those products by dozens of companies, each with its own supply chains and so on.</li>
<li>At the end of the appointment I was able to sign a little piece of paper (my dentist gives a discount for paying by check) and walk out. Lots more infrastructure behind that simple act: banks, currency, credit, clearance systems, etc.</li>
<li>And the fee was quite reasonable even though I'm "self-pay" (in my retired state, I don't have dental insurance) because in a market economy the costs for all the aforementioned inventions, products, and services are spread across millions of people. Think of how much money a king or queen five hundred years ago would have had to pay to receive anything close to this level of treatment!</li>
</ul>
<p>So yes, we all have a lot to be grateful for, even during a simple visit to the dentist...</p>

<h3>2024-10-20</h3>
<p>Moving on from his discussions of ideal relationships and then unequal relationships, Aristotle first takes a detour into different forms of political community (monarchy, aristocracy, democracy, etc.). This likely strikes us as strange, until Aristotle explains that <em>philia</em> holds societies together even more than justice does; in this context, I would translate the term as brotherhood (a somewhat attenuated kind of loving in especially short supply these days, it seems!). The idea is that <em>philia</em> exists to the extent that two or more people share common goals and activities, such as workmates (Aristotle's example is actually shipmates on a commercial venture), fellow soldiers, neighbors, participants in a religious order, or members of a social club. And all of these specific varieties of association exist under the broad framework of the overall society in which you live.</p>
<p>Aristotle observes that it is in relationships based on personal gain and usefulness that complaints and reproaches are most likely to arise. Consider life in a modern organization, where you might help a colleague with a project of theirs but not receive the same level of assistance with a project of your own; this kind of disparity, compounded over time, can cause you to rethink the entire relationship. By contrast, Aristotle says there are no complaints in stable relationships based on good character, mutual caring, and the pursuit of what's beautifully right as opposed to what's personally advantageous. A further cause of disagreement can occur when one person thinks the relationship is based on character but the other thinks it is based on usefulness or pleasure.</p>
<p>Yet Aristotle emphasizes that these matters can be extremely subtle: it can be difficult to figure out where you really stand, whether another person truly shares your values, when it makes sense to break off a relationship, etc. This is why we can't formulate hard-and-fast rules and instead need to develop a certain kind of wisdom [phronēsis] about human relationships.</p>
