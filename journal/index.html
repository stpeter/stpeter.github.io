<h2><a href="1792.html">The Examined Life</a></h2>
<h3>2023-06-28</h3>
<p>All the great questions of life boil down to this: What is the best way to live?</p>
<p>The great questions of life include the ones that Socrates posed 2400 year ago: what is courage? what is moderation? what is justice? what is love? what is beauty? what is truth? what is wisdom?</p>
<p>The great questions also include more modern concerns, such as how best to make a living, to find one's calling, or to interact with technology (topics that much exercised Thoreau, for instance).</p>
<p>I suppose that some people don't think about the great questions - instead they skate or slouch or sleepwalk through life, unaware of the deeper themes of human existence.</p>
<p>Others are certain that the great questions have straightforward answers, inherited from a particular creed or religion or cultural tradition.</p>
<p>Socrates often undercut such people's certainty by haranguing in the Athenian agora. Eventually they got tired of him and put him to death. Yet Socrates had the last laugh: no one remembers his accusers, but they do remember his admonition that the unexamined life is not worth living for a human being. In more positive terms we could phrase it like this: "The best way to live is to never stop asking yourself: What is the best way to live?"</p>

<h2><a href="1791.html">Threading a Middle Path</a></h2>
<h3>2023-06-22</h3>
<p>In the past I've written about both the ancient philosophical method of dialectic and the importance of intellectual and political moderation. Here I'd like to bring these two strands together.</p>
<p>To summarize briefly, in Aristotle's hands dialectic consists of four key steps: upon (i) reaching an impasse, you (ii) survey existing explanations and reputable opinions, (iii) engage in analysis to remove paradoxes and draw distinctions, then (iv) formulate a synthesis that harmonizes the explanations and saves the appearances.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, Aristotle's discussion of societal organization in his <cite>Politics</cite>. In the ancient Greece of 2400 years ago, there were three primary political philosophies: monarchy (rule by one person, whether king or tyrant), oligarchy (rule by the few, whether true aristocracy or faction), and democracy (rule by the people, whether community or rabble). Whereas most political philosophies attract what Eric Hoffer identified as true believers, Aristotle carefully weighs the positives and negatives of each approach to governance, concluding that the best form of government does justice to each of these three principles. Of note, the U.S. Founders manifested the strong influence of Aristotle when they defined roles for a single President, an somewhat aristocratic Senate, and a more populous House.</p>
<p>Similarly, in his <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> and <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite>, Aristotle considers three primary ways of life: the life of enjoyment, the life of public virtue, and the life of inquiry. In the end he concludes that the best life for human beings combines elements of all three; in particular, inquiry is deeply enjoyable and presupposes excellence of character. (I'll say much more about this in <cite>Complete Thyself</cite>, my forthcoming book on Aristotle's conception of human fulfillment.)</p>
<p>Because dialectic typically threads a middle path between extremes, one essential result is an abundance of moderation and a lack of partisanship. Thus dialectic can be a tool for the kind of healthy eclecticism I wrote about the other day, although it might go even farther by leading to a true synthesis of seeming opposites (sometimes referred to as syncretism).</p>
<p>I'm not saying this is easy. Many forces in present-day society (especially in America) lead us toward a downward spiral of angry, emotivistic extremism, not an upward spiral of interpersonal respect and reasonable moderation. Personally, I've found that the best way to avoid these extremes is to root myself in the eternal realities of deep human connection: family, friends, work, love, art, wisdom, community, and the like. In the end, what more do we really have?</p>

<h2><a href="1790.html">Chosen Wisdom</a></h2>
<h3>2023-06-20</h3>
<p>The longer I study and practice philosophy, the more value I find in a wide variety of wisdom traditions. When I first became interested in philosophy at the age of 12, it was exclusively in the form of Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism. About this philosophy I was, at least throughout my teenage years, thoroughly dogmatic: all the other philosophies were riddled with error - not even worth considering - and Rand's philosophy simply <em>was</em> philosophy as far as I was concerned. (To be clear, the fault was not Rand's but my own - I could have been just as dogmatic about Stoicism or existentialism.)</p>
<p>Ironically, it was by taking a course on the history of philosophy with a confirmed Objectivist that I experienced the first inklings of doubt. Delving into Aristotle in college opened my eyes further, but I would be lying if I said that I quickly realized the error of my ways. In fact, it took me years - decades - to see that philosophy is more of a verb than a noun, more of an activity than an established body of doctrine. To my mind, this implies that the point of philosophy is not to identify with or adhere to a particular school of thought, but to approach the deepest philosophical questions in a spirit of wonder and to independently discover the wisest answers wherever you may find them.</p>
<p>Dogmatists might derisively call this eclecticism. Yet, to strike at the root (as Thoreau once put it), in ancient Greek <em>eklektikos</em> meant being selective, exercising discernment, using your critical faculties, coming to first-hand judgments about the truth of things. To come full circle, this is entirely consistent with the very best of Rand's conception of reason, which she said is founded in "the independent mind that recognizes no authority higher than its own and no value higher than its judgment of truth."</p>
<p>It stands to reason that no one school of philosophy can do justice to the manifest complexities of human life, for we need multiple different perspectives to make sense of it all. At the same time, the different schools often see the same truths but assign them different emphases or express them in different terms, and part of the fun of philosophy as a way of life is seeing those deep connections across schools and thinkers.</p>
<p>To go even further, whatever chosen wisdom I achieve cannot be exactly the same as yours, because my activity of sense-making is not exactly the same as yours (that's the way minds work). This doesn't mean that all truth is utterly relative - for there are human universals like language, sociality, and autonomy - but it does mean that dialogue is fundamental to the love and practice of wisdom. Which is precisely what Socrates recognized 2500 years ago when he said that the unexamined life is not worth living, because we examine life both on our own and together in the everyday activities of work, love, family, friendship, and community. Anything less is less than fully human.</p>

<h2><a href="1789.html">More Humanity</a></h2>
<h3>2023-06-17</h3>
<p>The other day I observed that, in the balance between mindlessly using technology and deliberately honoring people's humanity (including my own), I tilt toward more humanity. But how does that cash out in everyday life?</p>
<p>In case it might prove helpful to readers, I figured I'd describe some of my personal policies and practices in relation to digital technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't use Facebook. To keep in touch with friends and family, I see them in person or talk with them via phone (preferred) or video.</li>
<li>In between visits and calls, I communicate via email or text - indeed, I'd still write physical letters, but I haven't found anyone who wants to do that anymore!</li>
<li>I don't use Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, etc.</li>
<li>Although I do still have a Twitter account, I log into it only a few times a year.</li>
<li>I visit YouTube only on occasion (e.g., to watch those helpful how-to videos or give an initial listen to hard-to-find music), and only in a private browsing window without logging into Google. I never click any of the videos that YouTube's algorithms recommend.</li>
<li>Speaking of Google, although I have a Google account, I log into it only when absolutely necessary and only in Google Chrome (which is not my everyday browser). Otherwise I use DuckDuckGo for search, Fastmail for email, Jitsi for video chat, and Brave or Firefox for browsing.</li>
<li>I have a smartphone, but I've installed only a bare minimum of apps on it.</li>
<li>On both my phone and my computer, I have popup notifications and "badges" (e.g., unread message counts) disabled.</li>
<li>I use a VPN to hide my real IP address from websites I visit.</li>
<li>I don't play any phone or computer games.</li>
<li>I have my phone interface set to greyscale so that the garish colors of the icons don't draw me in. For reading purposes, I use a mobile browser (Firefox in private browsing mode) in which I have images disabled.</li>
<li>I have autocorrect and autocomplete disabled on all my devices.</li>
<li>I try to use my phone as little as possible, and then mostly for reading, a bit of texting with the few people who know my phone number, and necessary workflows (e.g., two-factor authentication).</li>
<li>I haven't watched TV in 10-15 years.</li>
<li>Once in a while I listen to jazz or classical music on the radio if I happen to be in the car, but I turn it off at the top of the hour when they recite the news.</li>
<li>Although I read news headlines once a day (usually at wsj.com or text.npr.org), I don't read the actual news stories. Other than that, I avoid news websites (see above on algorithmic recommendations).</li>
<li>In preference to new websites, once or twice a week I make a scan of analytical articles at blogs and online magazines that I've found insightful, and I selectively read perhaps 20% of the articles.</li>
<li>In preference to blogs and magazines, I read books. I sometimes read old public-domain books online after I have posted them at my monadnock.net website, but for other books I don't use an e-reader; instead, I check physical books out of the library, often sourced via interlibrary loan because most of the books I read are less popular works of philosophy, history, science, and poetry. If a book I've taken out of the library seems especially useful for one of my research projects, I buy it used through bookfinder.com and mark it up while reading.</li>
</ul>
<p>To generalize, here are ten principles that I try to put into practice:</p>
<ol>
<li>Focus on my most important projects and relationships.</li>
<li>Follow my own priorities and interests, not what's trending or recommended.</li>
<li>Avoid technologies that can manipulate me through individualized profiling and algorithmic "personalization".</li>
<li>Eliminate distractions.</li>
<li>Prefer reading text over viewing images and videos.</li>
<li>Prefer in-person interactions over technologically-mediated interactions.</li>
<li>Prefer old technologies over new technologies.</li>
<li>Prefer slow technologies over fast technologies.</li>
<li>Prefer knowledge over information.</li>
<li>Prefer wisdom over knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<p>As I endeavor to live in accordance with these principles, I'll continue to reflect on them and hone them further.</p>

<h2><a href="1788.html">Software is Eating Our Humanity</a></h2>
<h3>2023-06-15</h3>
<p>While reading Stefan Zweig's book <cite>The World of Yesterday</cite> recently, I came across the following quote:</p>
<blockquote>It seems almost like Nature's fierce revenge on mankind that all the achievements of technology through which we have taken her mysterious forces into our own hands simultaneously destroy the soul. The greatest curse brought down on us by technology is that it prevents us from escaping the present even for a brief time. Previous generations could retreat into solitude and seclusion when disaster struck; it was our fate to be aware of everything catastrophic happening anywhere in the world at the hour and the second when it happened.</blockquote>
<p>Mind you, Zweig was writing about the 1930s! A prophetic statement indeed.</p>
<p>Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen is well known for declaring that "software is eating the world"; a corollary (since human beings are at the center of our world) is that software is eating our humanity. More and more, our interactions with each other, with our history, with ideas, with art, and even with physical reality are mediated by technology: to choose a few examples, by voice-response systems, website input forms, chatbots, in-car info screens, medical appointment scripts (wherein your doctor looks primarily at a screen, not you the patient), smartphones, social media apps, news and entertainment algorithms, and soon artificial intelligence and augmented reality.</p>
<p>Yet "mediated" is such an insipid word, isn't it? In truth, all too often it is our most human characteristics - our spontaneity, our creativity, our sociality, our empathy, our imagination, our individuality, or in old-fashioned language our soul - that our technologies constrain, ignore, suppress, and destroy.</p>
<p>At the same time, the human world is inherently a technological world because we have been tool-makers for millions of years. The question is always: do our tools serve us, or do we serve our tools? To me, increasingly it feels like the latter. (Yet it could be merely a matter of age: perhaps I'm comfortable with older technologies but not with newer ones.)</p>
<p>Naturally, finding a healthy balance between our technologies and our humanity is something that each of us must do on our own and within our families, friendships, organizations, and communities. For myself, I deliberately tilt toward more humanity, but it often feels like I'm swimming upstream...</p>

<h2><a href="1787.html">Keeping It Brief</a></h2>
<h3>2023-06-09</h3>
<p>Epicurus once said: "Understand that a long discourse and a short one both achieve the same result." Although that's standard advice for writers (Yevgeny Zamyatin counselled "writing with 90-proof ink"), few follow it. Many books could have been long articles, many long articles could have been blog posts, and many blog posts could have been aphorisms. My journal entries average around 400 words these days, and I limit my books to around 100 pages. This is simple respect for you, the reader. Besides, I'd rather provoke difficult questions than provide definitive answers, because only you can answer those questions for yourself, anyway. Perhaps loving wisdom involves respecting <em>your</em> wisdom as much as my own...</p>
