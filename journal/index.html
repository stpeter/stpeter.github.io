<h2><a href="1839.html">Philosophy vs. Philosophies</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-14</h3>
<p>On the very first page of his book <cite>What Is Ancient Philosophy?</cite>, Pierre Hadot — the late French scholar who almost singlehandedly resurrected the humanistic conception of philosophy as a way of life — drew a distinction between individual philosophies on the one hand and philosophy itself on the other:</p>
<blockquote>
Seldom do we reflect upon what philosophy is in itself. Indeed, it is extremely difficult to define it. What philosophy students are introduced to is above all <em>philosophies</em>.... In itself, there is nothing wrong with all this. It certainly seems that the way one can come to have an idea of <em>philosophy</em> is by studying <em>philosophies</em>. Yet the history of "philosophy" is not the same as the history of philosophies, if what we understand by "philosophies" are theoretical discourses and philosophers' systems. In addition to this history, however, there is room for the study of philosophical modes of life.
</blockquote>
<p>Here is one way to think about it: loving and practicing wisdom is not the same thing as adhering to a worldview. The aim of wisdom is self-mastery and self-knowledge, i.e., both serious self-examination as a central, organizing activity of your life and the development of deep "mindedness", intentionality, understanding, and insight as abiding traits of your thinking and character. By contrast, if you consider yourself to be primarily an adherent of a worldview, then your allegiance to the love and practice of wisdom is only secondary, and can be successful only to the extent that the worldview to which adhere truly values wisdom. Not all of them do: consider, for example, the very idea of utilitarianism as a way of life; as a rule-based ethical system, it doesn't really value wisdom and character as first-class concerns (of which, to my mind, the failures of Effective Altruism are merely the most recent manifestation).</p>
<p>It seems to me that the aspiration to be a philosopher is rooted in an existential commitment to live an examined life and to pursue truth wherever it may lead. By contrast, the aspiration to be, say, a loyal and consistent Stoic or Buddhist is rooted intellectually in accepting that worldview as final truth and emotionally in feeling the comfort of feeling that fundamentally your search for truth is over. To put it metaphorically: while the adherent sighs contentedly as he settles into his comfortable home, the explorer shoulders his pack to track the trail of truth over the next mountain range.</p>
<p>That said, I do think that a person can become wise within the narrower scope of a well-defined worldview; however, it might require more time and even some cognitive dissonance as the adherent tries to bend that worldview to deal with the messy realities of life. This might be easier in long-lived traditions like Confucianism and Christianity that contain competing strands of thought (e.g., the Augustinian and Thomistic strands of Christianity), since that enables the adherent to pick and choose different emphases to suit the demands of particular situations.</p>

<h2><a href="1838.html">More on Ancient Friends</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-13</h3>
<p>A mere two nights after quoting Niccolò Machiavelli's reflections on his ancient friends, I came upon a similar passage in <cite>Essays in Idleness</cite>, written by the Japanese poet-monk Yoshida Kenkō around the year 1330. Here's what Kenkō had to say, in the translation by Donald Keene:</p>
<blockquote>
The pleasantest of all diversions is to sit alone under the lamp, a book spread out before you, and to make friends with people of a distant past you have never known. The books I would choose are the moving volumes of <cite>Wen Hsüan</cite>, the collected works of Po Chü-i, the sayings of Lao Tzu, and the chapters of Chuang Tzu.
</blockquote>
<p>Whereas Machiavelli conversed with ancient Greek and Roman historians like Polybius and Livy, Kenkō befriended Chinese poets and Taoist philosophers. Much as I enjoy history, I give the nod to Kenkō because his preferences align more closely with mine. As Aristotle said in Chapter IX of the <cite>Poetics</cite>: "Poetry is a more philosophical and a higher thing than history: for poetry tends to express the universal, history the particular."</p>

<h2><a href="1837.html">Planning to Be Old</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-12</h3>
<p>Earlier this year at a family gathering, I overheard an uncle of mine (who is in his late 80s) say something in passing to one of his siblings about the importance of planning to be old. This set me to thinking: what might such planning involve? Here are some possible considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saving and investing well so that you can remain financially solvent late in life</li>
<li>Staying physically active so that you can manage everyday tasks as long as possible</li>
<li>Staying mentally active so that you are sharp enough to handle things like financial decisions as you get older</li>
<li>Staying socially active to ensure your emotional health</li>
<li>Accepting the various pains and annoyances of old age without complaint</li>
<li>Learning to be alone, since if you live long enough you will lose some of the people who are dear to you</li>
<li>Giving back by volunteering in your community</li>
<li>Seeking truth and meaning by continuing to acquire wisdom as long as you live</li>
<li>Sharing some of the wisdom you have gained through mentoring, teaching, or creative pursuits</li>
<li>Leaving a legacy by selecting worthy causes to which you can donate time or money</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these activities require foresight, common sense, and practical wisdom, which too often are lacking in our youth-obsessed, live-for-the-day society. But they are far from impossible to cultivate, so it's best to start now...</p>

<h2><a href="1836.html">Ancient Friends</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-10</h3>
<p>On this day 510 years ago (December 10th, 1513), Niccolò Machiavelli wrote a now-famous letter to his friend Francesco Vettori about his life in exile from Florence - and about a little book he was writing, which has come down to us as <cite>The Prince</cite>. After relating what had happened that day on his farm and in the village, he described his evening routine, when he would "visit" with Plutarch, Polybius, Livy, Aristotle, and other great minds of antiquity:</p>
<blockquote>
When evening has come, I return to my house and go into my study. At the door I take off my clothes of the day, covered with mud and mire, and I put on my regal and courtly garments; and decently reclothed, I enter the ancient courts of ancient men, where, received by them lovingly, I feed on the food that alone is mine and that I was born for. There I am not ashamed to speak with them and to ask them the reason for their actions; and they in their humanity reply to me. And for the space of four hours I feel no boredom, I forget every pain, I do not fear poverty, death does not frighten me. I deliver myself entirely to them. And because Dante says that to have understood without retaining does not make knowledge, I have noted what capital I have made from their conversation and have composed a little work <cite>De Principatibus</cite>, where I delve as deeply as I can into reflections on this subject, debating what a principality is, of what kinds they are, how they are acquired, how they are maintained, why they are lost.
</blockquote>
<p>I love the image of Machiavelli's ancient friends, who receive him lovingly and converse with him in their great-hearted humanity. It reminds me of something that Nietzsche wrote in <cite>Human, All Too Human</cite>, which I quoted once before in a blog post about Aristotle and Thoreau over twenty years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
I, too, have been in the underworld, like Odysseus, and will often be there again; and I have not only sacrificed rams to be able to talk with the dead, but have not spared my own blood as well. There have been four pairs who did not refuse themselves to me, the sacrificer: Epicurus and Montaigne, Goethe and Spinoza, Plato and Rousseau, Pascal and Schopenhauer. With these I have had to come to terms when I have wandered long alone, from them will I accept judgment, to them will I listen when in doing so they judge one another. Whatever I say, resolve, cogitate for myself and others: upon these eight I fix my eyes and see theirs fixed upon me.
</blockquote>
<p>I, too, might have such pairs: Aristotle and Thoreau, Nietzsche and Epicurus, Socrates and Pyrrho, Lao Tzu and Rand, Spinoza and Montaigne are the ones that come immediately to mind, at least in philosophy (I can think of others in the realms of poetry and literature). It's a rare and good thing to have such friends.</p>

<h2><a href="1835.html">Reality is Messy</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-09</h3>
<p>The usually reasonable Arnold Kling, one of my favorite bloggers going back 25 years, has been using ChatGPT to build an essay-grading app and might have taken one too many sips of the Kool-Aid. Consider:</p>
<blockquote>Imagine what will happen when these AIs are connected to physical tools. These physical tools might be custom robots or all-purpose robots. You could be a farmer who never has to go into the fields — just explain to the robots what you want. Or you could be a chef who gives directions without being in the kitchen. Or a scientist who conducts experiments without having to spend all day in the lab.</blockquote>
<p>Let's extend that further. You could be a sailor who never needs to step foot on a boat; or a composer who never needs to touch a piano; or an artist who never needs to pick up a brush; or a friend who never needs to meet for coffee; or a spouse who never needs to help around the house; or a parent who never needs to take your ("the"?) kid to the playground. Get the AI robots to deal with messy realities while you sit in the metaverse telling them what to do! (Ignoring the fact that you won't know what commands to issue unless you have some experience and understanding of those messy realities in the first place.)</p>
<p>Is this a world that any sane human being wants to live in? Is this the path to greater human wisdom and fulfillment?</p>
<p>We are physical beings and embodied selves, not disembodied minds. Sure, reality is messy, but that's where learning and flourishing happen: in going into the fields, experimenting in the lab or the kitchen, feeling the wind in your face, doodling at the piano, mixing paints, venturing out for coffee, working side by side with your partner, holding your child's hand. These fantasies of transcending our bodies and our physical interactions are so deeply misguided that it's hard to know where to start in critiquing them, other than to feel sorry for those who indulge in them. (To be fair, I don't think Kling is one of them because he often writes about the inherent pleasures of activities like grandparenting and Israeli dancing, I just think he got carried away.)</p>

<h2><a href="1834.html">An Aristotelian Glossary</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-06</h3>
<p>Of late I've been working on the first serious contribution to my forthcoming book about Aristotle's conception of human fulfillment: a glossary of key terms. Those curious enough to peruse it will quickly discover that some of my renderings are rather non-standard. In my defense, usually these translations are rooted in ancient Greek etymology and usage or modern academic scholarship (e.g., both Aryeh Kosman and Myles Burnyeat recommended "understanding" instead of "knowledge" for <em>epistēmē</em>, as noted in my recent post "Understanding What You Know"); however, in a few instances I go farther out on a limb (e.g., "thriving" instead of "virtue" for <em>aretē</em> and, most centrally of all, "fulfillment" instead of "happiness" for <em>eudaimonia</em>). Although all of these renderings are subject to change, I'm quite satisfied with them so far (having pondered them for years) and in fact they provide a good indication of the interpretive direction I'm taking.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
