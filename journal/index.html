<h2><a href="1775.html">Philosophy and Grief</a></h2>
<h3>2023-04-06</h3>
<p>Grieving is one of the characteristic activities of human beings. Although it seems that some other species (e.g., members of the corvid family) experience sorrow, grief is a more complex phenomenon. Recently I had occasion to read a fine book on the topic by Michael Cholbi, entitled <cite>Grief: A Philosophical Guide</cite>. Here are the essentials of what I gleaned.</p>
<p>To begin, we must understand that grief is not an emotion but an activity. Yes, grieving can involve a wide range of emotional reactions: sorrow of course, but also anxiety, guilt, anger, even joy (as Epicurus said: "Sweet is the memory of a dead friend."). But grieving also includes mental states such as confusion and perplexity, as well as mental activities such as deliberation and reflection.</p>
<p>The grounding for this intellectual component is the fact that any significant personal relationship entails a conception of what someone means to you - and that kind of meaning is bound up with your identity, your social role (e.g., within a family), indeed your entire conception of what it means to be human.</p>
<p>Cholbi makes a twofold argument. First, when someone close to you dies (or leaves you or otherwise disappears from your life), the relationship - formed of memories, expectations, longings, commitments, characteristic activities, and so on - is still there, but vastly changed. Second, because of the aforementioned ties to personal identity and practical meaning, coming to understand those changes is a process of gaining greater self-knowledge and thus represents a philosophical achievement.</p>
<p>Perhaps Emily Dickinson summed it up best:</p>
<blockquote>
There is a finished feeling<br>
Experienced at Graves -<br>
A leisure of the Future -<br>
A Wilderness of Size.
<br><br>
By Death's bold Exhibition<br>
Preciser what we are<br>
And the Eternal function<br>
Enabled to infer.
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, it's worth noting that grief was actively discouraged by most of the ancient philosophers, including Socrates, the Stoics, Chuang Tzu, and the Buddha; two notable exceptions were Aristotle and Confucius.</p>

<h2><a href="1774.html">Battle of the Bricks</a></h2>
<h3>2023-03-30</h3>
<p>Last year I decided to read <cite>War and Peace</cite> for the first time. Although Tolstoy's powers of psychological observation are amazing, I got stuck about halfway through (during a lengthy description of a fox hunt), and since then I haven't really been able to get back into it. It didn't help that none of the characters appealed to me strongly, perhaps because so many of them exhibit high levels of pretentiousness or self-deception - or both! Yes, 635 pages is a large investment of time, but getting from there to page 1386 feels like a tough slog and I'm not sure I have the energy.</p>
<p>By contrast, before a recent trip I was looking for a book to read, so I decided to pick up Julie Rose's translation of <cite>Les Misérables</cite>. At 1194 pages this is far from a slim volume, but I have every confidence of finishing it. Granted, I've read Hugo's masterpiece three or four times in another translation, so the story line is familiar. Yet I find myself delighted anew with Hugo's characters and scenes, even with his historical and philosophical digressions (which, I realize, are an acquired taste). The pages are flying by!</p>
<p>It's fascinating that one's patience with and appreciation of a writer can be so personal. I suppose the same goes for friends and other people in one's life. Indeed, Hugo himself makes the connection on page 138: "books are remote but reliable friends." I almost included <cite>Les Misérables</cite> in my recent list of "best friend books"; revisiting this old friend makes me certain that it needs to be on the list.</p>

<h2><a href="1773.html">Intellectual Jousting</a></h2>
<h3>2023-03-17</h3>
<p>In my recent post on intelligence vs. wisdom, I used the phrase "intellectual jousting" to describe the modern practice of doing philosophy. Here's a bit of psychological speculation about how that activity comes to be valued.</p>
<p>Let's say you were the smartest kid in your elementary school class. It feels great to be lauded by the teacher, to ace the tests, and so on. Then you advance to a middle school that's fed by several elementary schools and you're still the smartest kid in the class. Yay! Then you go to a high school that'd fed by several middle schools. It might be less than fully clear who's the smartest now because people start to diverge by subject matter (math whizzes, physics geeks, etc.), but you discover a way to prove your superiority: arguments! After picking up some rhetorical tricks, you can easily best the other kids in your school. Wonderful, you're still the best!</p>
<p>Then you head off to college. If you're especially intelligent (which of course you are), you go to Harvard or Yale or Princeton or Oxford or Cambridge or some such exclusive venue. Now you are surrounded by really smart people - future Nobel Prize winners, Supreme Court justices, and the like. You need to up your argumentative game, at least among those who have self-selected into the most difficult major that doesn't require calculus: philosophy. It's time to learn advanced polemical skills, master formal and informal logic, and hone your argumentative strategies. Once you've done that, you still come out on top.</p>
<p>So it's off to one of the highest-rated Ph.D. programs. Here the competitive atmosphere thickens: you need to prove yourself ever more sharp, clever, quick, brilliant, and resourceful. You become ever more adept at lobbing fatal objections, making cutting remarks, identifying your opponents' logical lapses, and all that. To further prove your intellectual superiority, above all you do these things really fast. Taking time to think things through is for dullards: those with the highest philosophical IQ demonstrate immediate insight. They are, as Colin McGinn puts it, outrageously brilliant. (Do recall the two meanings of "outrageous"!)</p>
<p>Upon completing years of rigorous training and practice in argumentation, you have achieved that exalted status: champion jouster of the intellect. If you're lucky, you'll find a job teaching philosophy to unsuspecting undergraduates for a few years before being denied tenure. If you're extremely lucky, you'll revel in your intellectual superiority for decades while looking down on graduate students and adjunct faculty from your high perch as a tenured professor.</p>
<p>You can have it.</p>

<h2><a href="1772.html">Intelligence vs. Wisdom</a></h2>
<h3>2023-03-17</h3>
<p>Ever since I left behind the high arrogance of my teenage years, I have valued wisdom over intelligence. This is likely why I'm much more drawn to the ancient conception of philosophy as a way of life than to the modern conception of philosophy as an exercise in argumentation.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the criteria that Colin McGinn associates with those who are best at the activity or skill of what's known as doing philosophy: "cleverness, ingenuity, argumentative power, intellectual penetration, insight, polemical punch, sheer philosophical IQ" along with being "so sharp, so intellectually resourceful, so outright brilliant (outrageously so)."</p>
<p>That's all fine for the modern-day sophists who inhabit academia, but I'm not impressed. As I see it, the purpose of philosophical knowledge is not intellectual jousting, but living well. That's why philosophy in its original sense meant the love and practice of wisdom.</p>
<p>Now, I happen to think that exposing yourself to the great philosophical thinkers and traditions helps you to succeed more fully at the task of living a complete human life. Yet one needn't study philosophy in order to attain a fair measure of wisdom: instead, you need to have some experience of life, reflect on that experience, and use the resulting insights to guide your choices and commitments. But perhaps that's too democratic for elitist philosophical experts, eh?</p>
<p>Based on the aforementioned criteria, Colin McGinn has also argued that the greatest philosopher in history is none other than ... Colin McGinn! In the comments section to the post where he makes that claim (perhaps somewhat tongue-in-cheek), he states flat-out that "Philosophy is not a practice (ethical disposition); it's an intellectual subject." If that is so, then perhaps doing philosophy has nothing to do with living a good human life.</p> 
<p>Although these two viewpoints might seem to be worlds apart, I think we might be able to find a middle ground. After all, at least a few of the great philosophers have remained aware of the practical importance of wisdom while pursuing foundational insights in philosophical theory. In that rarified group I'd include the likes of Plato, Aristotle, Chuang Tzu, Spinoza, J.S. Mill, William James, and George Santayana. How did they do it? That's a subject for another post...</p>

<h2><a href="1771.html">Information is Overrated</a></h2>
<h3>2023-03-09</h3>
<p>It's said that we live in the Information Age. Yet what is the purpose of information? I see at least three possibilities...</p>
<p>First, information can make our decision more effective, especially regarding threats and opportunities. Is that sound in the forest a predator from which I should flee? Is this fruit edible? Does this potential mate find me attractive? If I click this like button, will my friends disapprove? That kind of thing.</p>
<p>Yet it strikes me that these days we often consume information in such a mindless way that it moves us to make unnecessarily frequent decisions, or at least to think that we need to. As an example, I follow an investing approach called the permanent portfolio, which requires rebalancing only once every few years; however, if I followed the financial press I might feel the need to make frequent investing decisions (most of which would be driven by fear or greed). Similarly, I eat a balanced diet containing lots of fruits and vegetables, but if I paid close attention to health news I might feel the need to reguarly modify my diet so as to include the latest fad foods. And these areas are fairly objective because they're based on needs for health and wealth: don't get me started on information about celebrities, athletes, politicians, and other such personalities.</p>
<p>Second, closely related to information as an input to a decision is information as a trigger for emotion. If a work colleague tells me that layoffs are imminent, I might get worried that I'm about to lose my job. If a friend shares a cutesy cat video, I might experience a shot of happy feelings. If everyone I know is worked up about the latest crime spree, police violence, or international incident, I might get worked up, too.</p>
<p>Just as our obsessive consumption of information leads to excessive motion in the realm of decision, so also it leads to excessive motion (literally, e-motion) in realm of feeling. We are always reacting: sometimes overjoyed but more often hopping mad, downtrodden, grieving, depressed, restlessly anxious. By filling our heads with information, we have lost our heads.</p>
<p>A third purpose for information might be to help us craft our views about the world, even if no immediate decisions or emotions are involved. Following the familiar <em>scala scientia</em>, information might help us gain knowledge, and knowledge might help us gain wisdom. For instance: what would it say about society or human nature if Putin succeeds in his bloodthirsty, maniacal destruction of a free and independent Ukraine?</p>
<p>Well, it's a bad situation over there, but how much can we really come to <em>know</em> by seeking information about every twist and turn of the Russian invasion? It seems to me that we're not learning all that much which is new. Better, I think, to familiarize ourselves with the long tradition of Russian autocracy or, even deeper, the social and historical insights of Thucydides. From that direction lies knowledge and wisdom - not from the ceaseless, breathless chatter of events, events, events.</p>
<p>Thus along these three dimensions - action, reaction, knowledge - I see few benefits and many costs from immersing ourselves in the flood of information to which we are all exposed these days. Information is overrated.</p>

<h2><a href="1770.html">Counter-Cultural Contemplation</a></h2>
<h3>2023-03-02</h3>
<p>We live in a culture that glorifies action, busy-ness, and constant activity. "Don't just stand there, do something." "Idle hands are the devil's workshop." "Pull your head out of the clouds." "Get real." "Think globally, act locally." "Knowledge is power."</p>
<p>This attitude has even bled into philosophy, that most abstract of humanistic disciplines. It was Francis Bacon (1561-1626) who first insisted that knowledge is power. Philosophy as political activism is a more recent invention; we can perhaps date it to 1845, the year in which Karl Marx proclaimed that "Philosophers have hitherto only <em>interpreted</em> the world in various ways; the point is to <em>change</em> it." Yet Marx, who wrote his doctoral dissertation on the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, should have known better. As Pierre Hadot has explained, in ancient times the purpose of philosophy as a way of life was never merely to interpret the world, and certainly not primarily to change it, but to <em>change oneself</em>.</p>
<p>"Be the change you want to see." That sounds like another form of activism, doesn't it? But what if the change you pursue is to withdraw from the hustle-bustle of activism in all its forms and instead to use your leisure time for the serious purpose of inquiry, awareness, and deep understanding of the causes of things?</p>
<p>In the context of 21st century society, could the <em>vita contemplativa</em> be the ultimate counter-culture and perhaps even a threat to those in authority, since it fundamentally repudiates the avaricious acquisition of power, wealth, status, and fame?</p>
<p>Something to ponder...</p>
