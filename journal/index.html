<h2><a href="1927.html">Desert Island Books</a></h2>
<h3>2024-12-04</h3>
<p>My reading list contains hundreds of items. Indeed, I maintain multiple such lists, since some of them are dedicated to particular research topics or historical figures on which I plan to write books of my own, such as Pyrrho, Socrates, and Shakespeare. Periodically, however, I like to think about how I would cull my reading list down to absolute essentials if forced to do so. The general principle seems to be: which authors would I most want to interact with in future years, for the sake of learning, enjoyment, and contemplation?</p>
<p>Having pondered it again recently, I'd say that nowadays my desert island books would look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aristotle - Complete Works</li>
<li>Emily Dickinson - Complete Poems</li>
<li>Homer - Iliad, Odyssey</li>
<li>Lao Tzu - Tao Te Ching</li>
<li>Lin Yutang - The Importance of Living</li>
<li>Michel de Montaigne - Essays</li>
<li>Plato - Complete Dialogues</li>
<li>William Shakespeare - Complete Plays</li>
<li>Spinoza - Ethics</li>
<li>Henry David Thoreau - Walden</li>
<li>Walt Whitman - Leaves of Grass</li>
</ul>
<p>For the ancient Greek authors, I'd want both English translations and Greek originals. I'd also need some reference books: the OED, Webster's Dictionary of 1841, Smyth's Greek Grammar, Cunliffe's Lexicon of the Homeric Dialect, and the LSJ (standard dictionary of ancient Greek). Because some of these are published in multiple volumes, all told that's about thirty physical books.</p>
<p>Naturally this leaves out many, many books and authors that I'd like to explore or re-read, but difficult decisions would need to be made if I were shipped off to that mythical desert island...</p>

<h2><a href="1926.html">The Price of Wisdom</a></h2>
<h3>2024-12-01</h3>
<p>When Socrates was put on trial in Athens for corrupting the youth, part of his defense was that he never requested payment for attending to the concerns of other people and encouraging them to live a more virtuous, examined life; instead he came to people individually "like a father or elder brother" (Plato, Apology, 31b), acting out of care for their souls. In a little-noted passage in Nicomachean Ethics IX.1 (1164a33-b6), Aristotle seems to expand on this line of thinking. First he observes that in relationships founded on excellence of character - such as, say, the relationship of parent to child or elder sibling to younger sibling - the parties engage in good deeds toward each other and return favors through their own free choice and mutual commitment. Drawing an analogy between interpersonal love and the love of wisdom, he then says:</p>
<blockquote>And it seems to be this way too with those who have shared in philosophy, for its worth is not measured in money and no honor could be of equal weight with it, but perhaps it is enough, as with gods and one's parents, to give what is possible.</blockquote>
<p>If indeed Aristotle offered wise counsel to the people with whom he interacted philosophically (see my notes on Nicomachean Ethics X.9), it seems likely that he did this work as a gift and that, just as with Socrates before him, he did not ask to be paid - for wisdom is literally priceless and (like love and friendship) stands outside the monetary economy. However, those who benefited from his attentive care might have returned the favor by "giving what is possible", for instance by bestowing gifts upon him or honoring him in distinctive ways. Indeed, in the generation after Aristotle, Epicurus seems to have had a similar attitude, as captured in Vatican Saying #32: "Honoring a sage is itself a great good to the one who honors." Although I haven't looked, I think we could find similar quotes among the ancient Confucians, Taoists, Buddhists, Hindus, and Stoics.</p>
<p>Nowadays we find this way of thinking to be quite foreign, even impertinent: how dare you consider your services to be above remuneration, as if you're some kind of godlike sage? Given that Socrates referred to the people in his circle as friends (not students since he felt he had nothing to teach), the analogy of friendship might be more welcome. For instance, you don't pay a friend to meet you for lunch so that you can talk through a tough situation you're facing, yet sometime afterward (though not in a quid pro quo manner) you might give your friend an extra special gift. I suspect this is how many of the ancient philosophers conceived of the counsel and instruction they gave.</p>

<h2><a href="1925.html">Seeing Like an Ideology</a></h2>
<h3>2024-11-30</h3>
<p>In his classic book <cite>Seeing Like a State</cite>, James C. Scott describes numerous schemes by which what he calls "high-modernist" planners attempted to impose order on the perceived chaos of human societies: collectivized farms in Soviet Russia, compulsory villagization in parts of Africa, unworkable cities like Brasília, etc. All of these schemes to overcome the messy realities of human existence have been able to survive their own manifest failings only because of creative workarounds discovered through human inventiveness and practical know-how (which, borrowing an ancient Greek word that Homer used to describe the wily Odysseus, he calls mētis / μῆτις).</p>
<p>Because centralized planning and government control are so often accompanied and justified by an <em>ideology</em> (communism, fascism, nationalism, etc.), we might find it productive to apply Scott's insights directly to the realm of ideas. We can call this "seeing like an ideology". Let us consider a few quotes from the conclusion to Scott's book.</p>
<blockquote>The clarity of the high-modernist optic is due to its resolute singularity. Its simplifying fiction is that, for any activity or process that comes under its scrutiny, there is only one thing going on.</blockquote>
<p>As I've observed before, there's never just one cause. Because reality is complex, we can't ascribe every problem in society to political corruption, systemic racism, climate change, the patriarchy, income disparities, government overreach, the left-wing march through the institutions, or any other single factor. Further, we also can't pigeonhole any individual person as "only one thing" based on class, race, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, political affiliation, educational attainment, etc. Yet it seems to me that ideologies necessarily engage in just this sort of reductive simplification. The results are well described in another quote:</p>
<blockquote>Almost all strictly functional, single-purpose institutions have some of the qualities of sensory deprivation tanks used for experimental purposes. At the limit, they approach the great social control institutions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries: asylums, workhouses, prisons, and reformatories. We have learned enough of such settings to know that over time they can produce among their inmates a characteristic institutional neurosis marked by apathy, withdrawal, lack of initiative and spontaneity, uncommunicativeness, and intractability. The neurosis is an accommodation to a deprived, bland, monotonous, controlled environment that is ultimately stupifying. The point is simply that high-modernist designs for life and production tend to diminish the skills, agility, initiative, and morale of their intended beneficiaries.</blockquote>
<p>It strikes me that ideological movements, even absent their realization in institutions, can have a similarly stultifying effect. When everything personal is political, when everything individual is ideological, when (to paraphrase Mussolini) all is within the movement and nothing is outside the movement, then the emotional and intellectual life of the adherent becomes cramped, constrained, controlled, conforming, claustrophobic.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the ideology itself (if we can anthropomorphize such a thing), this is not a bug but a feature: in true binary fashion, a human being must be either an orthodox adherent or an archenemy. Moreover, it's not acceptable for adherents to be complex, because complexity is the nemesis of the reductive drive inherent in all ideologies. Yet complexity is the very essence of personhood. Thus I conclude that ideology is at root a <em>dehumanizing</em> phenomenon, just as its institutional counterparts are.</p>

<h2><a href="1924.html">Taking Notes</a></h2>
<h3>2024-11-26</h3>
<p>Since I seem to be on a roll writing about habits, I figured I'd mention another one: taking notes during meetings.</p>
<p>Over the last five years of my tech career, I got really good at this. It started when I used to volunteer as a scribe during industry standardization meetings at the IETF, wherein I would jot down the main discussion points and action items so that the working group chairs could provide a session summary to the conference proceedings. Over time, I started doing the same thing in my day job - especially at Mozilla, where I had a huge number of meetings with partners and it became difficult to keep track of it all.</p>
<p>Initially I did this in paper notebooks, but that method had a few major downsides. First, the resulting notes weren't searchable. Second, I can type way faster than I can write. My solution was to keep all my notes in text files on my computer, which I could search through using the `grep` utility at the Unix command line. (Yes, I'm a geek - more normal folks might use a dedicated note-taking app.) For each meeting, I would create a separate file named `partner-yyyy-mm-dd.txt`, thus making it easy to see the entire history of interactions. For each meeting, I would list the participants, write up major discussion points and decisions, list action items (prefaced by "TODO" for improved searchability). If I had time, I would quickly review and correct the notes after the meeting; if I had back-to-back meetings, as was often the case, I would try to do this at the end of the day while my memories were still fresh.</p>
<p>For our most important partners, we kept notes in shared documents, which was good for transparency and collaborative note-taking but more distracting for me because I find it convenient to type in a small terminal window tucked away in the bottom right corner of the screen while most of the screen is devoted to the video conferencing app where the meeting takes place.</p>
<p>Speaking of distracting, you might wonder: doesn't it annoy other participants if I'm typing away during a meeting? I'm a fairly noisy typist, but I've learned to type more quietly and I also mute myself when not speaking (here it helps to have a corded headset with a physical mute button).</p>
<p>Taking notes in this way really helped me to stay organized, follow through on my commitments, and communicate more effectively. If you give it a try, let me know how it goes.</p>

<h2><a href="1923.html">Good Distractions</a></h2>
<h3>2024-11-25</h3>
<p>While talking with a friend today, I described my concept of the "to don't list" as well as a few of my personal best practices related to smartphone usage. In the midst of our conversation, it occurred to me that there's such a thing as a good distraction. It's difficult for even the most disciplined person to stay focused all the time on long-term projects and personal productivity. We all need a mental break! Yet, speaking from experience, all too often I'm wont to pull out my smartphone or computer and check the headlines, even though I've been on a low-information diet for 10-15 years and intellectually I know the news isn't helpful for my state of mind. At least for me, this a bad distraction!</p>
<p>By contrast, for me good distractions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Picking up my guitar to play a song or work my way through a few more measures of a piece I'm learning (currently that's the Trois Gymnopédies of Erik Satie).</li>
<li>Stepping outside to stretch my legs and walk the dogs.</li>
<li>Reading a poem or two (preferably in a book because the ideal distraction happens in the real world, but failing that at my Monadnock website).</li>
<li>Taking a photo of cloud formations and sending it to my friend Paul.</li>
<li>Checking the liner notes of whatever recording I'm listening to.</li>
<li>Leafing through an art book to soak in a few paintings.</li>
<li>Watching the birds at our bird feeder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thinking about what makes for good distractions will, I suspect, cause me to be even more intentional about seeking them out, thus solidifying the practice.</p>
<p>As another friend of mine likes to say: "Good habits are hard to break." True - but it's forming them in the first place that's the challenge! ;-)</p>

<h2><a href="1922.html">Powerless</a></h2>
<h3>2024-11-24</h3>
<p>Several friends I've talked with recently have expressed despair over the results of the recent U.S. elections, disbelief over Donald Trump's picks for cabinet roles, even a desire to move to Canada or Europe - plus a kind of wonder that I'm able to maintain my equanimity in what they see as a dire situation. In case it might prove helpful to other folks, I'll try to describe my mindset.</p>
<p>First, I tend not to catastrophize because it seems to me that human beings have a nearly endless capacity for muddling through, adjusting to new circumstances, counteracting overreach, etc.</p>
<p>Second, I doubt that we are precisely situated at the crossroads of history or that we are facing an unprecedented Emergency Disaster Crisis of epic proportions. Let's not overstate our own importance. (And yes, I do hear the cries of "this time it really is different!")</p>
<p>Third, I've read enough about American history to understand that we have always had many strands of political thought in this country, and that out of these many strands a stronger (if always somewhat fractious) union has been weaved over the centuries. E Pluribus Unum.</p>
<p>Fourth, representative democracy in America (despite its faults and our inability so far to fully live up to our founding ideals) has existed for 400 years, at every level of government: one nation, 50 states, 3000+ counties, tens of thousands of cities and towns with their councils and boards and all the rest. I believe this culture of self-governance is more robust than some people fear.</p>
<p>Fifth and finally, I recognize that I have absolutely no power or influence over the ship of state. That is certainly the case at the national level: I am only one of ~340,000,000 people in the USA, I have neither sought nor gained any role in government or politics, I don't have the ear of any influential people, I'm not a so-called public intellectual, etc. The same is true here in Colorado (where I'm only one of ~6,000,000 people), in Douglas County (where I'm only one of ~400,000 people), etc. In my neighborhood of ~200 households I do run our website and serve on the board of our civic association, so here I'm able to have something of a positive impact, but in general I'm just as powerless as almost everyone else in this country.</p>
<p>The difference, perhaps, is this: I accept that I'm powerless. Over the years, I have tried to rid myself of political delusions. I don't see myself as a member of Team Blue or Team Red or any other team, because unless you're especially active in retail politics (which I'm not) then you're not really a member of a team - you're merely rooting from a seat in the bleachers. I don't kid myself that my "one small voice" of a weblog is a soapbox of any significance. I don't believe, against all evidence to the contrary, that my political opinions matter to anyone but me, or that expressing them will be anything but a source of frustration to myself and annoyance to others. And so on.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, understanding and accepting that I'm powerless is, if not exactly empowering, at least liberating. For all I know, the day-to-day machinations of powerful people in Washington, D.C. or my state capitol might as well be happening in a parallel universe. Yes, journalists and pundits have an unwelcome habit of reporting and commenting on this parallel universe as if it were the most important thing in the world, but for the most part I can ignore them and their delusions of grandeur, too.</p>
<p>What I'm left with are the aspects of life that are somewhat within my span of influence and control: my family, friendships, neighborhood, projects, activities, etc. That's quite enough to focus on without fretting about the things I cannot change.</p>
<p>Naturally, what works for me won't necessarily work for you. YMMV.</p>
