<h2><a href="2016.html">Workout #2</a></h2>
<h3>2025-12-26</h3>
<p>Continuing my Soul Workout, I've been reflecting on this question: "Am I less tolerant than I could be of other people's behavior and opinions?"</p>
<p>I've been pondering this topic for a long time, partly in reaction to the judgmental attitude that my parents had toward other people. Although in my younger years I too could be quite judgmental, I didn't like that behavior in myself, not did other people appreciate it! Throughout my adult life I've continually reflected on my interactions with friends, family members, co-workers, neighbors, and the folks I've run across in my day-to-day activities. Although it seems to me that determinism is a fantasy, this practice of observation and reflection has led me over time to an inkling of something akin to fate, in that as a matter of biological inheritance and environmental influence most people don't have that much control over who they are, what they think, and how they behave. Yes, there is some control at the margins, but it's less pervasive and fine-grained than we might think; indeed, the operative word might not be "control" but something closer to guidance or steering of a ship whose underlying direction was set long ago. (Do note that these thoughts are speculative: I don't mean to imply that I have a settled theory about human nature, let alone univeralist prescriptions, because it's a subject of high complexity and likely beyond my ken.)</p>
<p>Putting these reflections into practice - which is what matters, after all - has led me to be more tolerant of other people's behavior and opinions. Do people have control over what they think? If they do - and if you believe that there's one true opinion that all people would hold if only they were smart or wise or knowledgeable or teachable enough - then in my experience it's all too easy to get frustrated or even angry with those who see things a different way. If, on the other hand, you recognize that our human reality is irreducibly complex and that there are many valid if partial perspectives on the human condition, then compassion is a virtue, agreement is overrated, and pluralistic tolerance is not merely a necessary evil but a positive good.</p>
<p>For the most part, the same goes for behavioral differences. Naturally, there are limits. I feel no compassion for dictators, thugs, thieves, or murderers, and I feel no guilt over that lack of compassion. My attitude is similar with regard to backstabbing co-workers, nasty neighbors, abusive relatives, and false friends (yes, I've experienced them all). Beyond a certain point my goodwill fractures and tolerance is replaced by damage control, avoidance, and forgetting (but not forgiving - a topic for another day). However, that's the exception; within the limits of civilized discourse and behavior I find that tolerance is the best policy, and it's one that I've actively put into practice over the years.</p>

<h2><a href="2015.html">Workout #1</a></h2>
<h3>2025-12-23</h3>
<p>Following up on my post about a Soul Workout, I've hit the spiritual gym and done some reflective reps on my personal practices. So far I've focused on three of the six questions I gleaned from Eric Hoffer's book <cite>The Passionate State of Mind</cite>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What do I falsely believe about myself because other people say it's so?</li>
  <li>Am I overly governed by what other people think of me?</li>
  <li>Do I have a craving for seeming important to other people?</li>
</ul>
<p>Hoffer connects these questions with susceptibility to both flattery and calumny. On reflection, I'd say that I don't seem to be overly governed by what other people think of me, which implies that I don't tend to be swayed by other people's opinions about me, whether positive or negative. In fact this has been my way for a long time, perhaps out of personal stubbornness (a family trait on my mother's side!) or perhaps out of agreement with the Epicurean maxim to live unknown.</p>
<p>As to that last point, self-deception appears to be an occupational hazard for anyone who pursues fame, power, status, influence, or importance. Yet if you can accept that your actions will have no impact on present-day society or the course of history, and even accept that at the end of your life you will quickly pass out of human memory, then most people's opinions of you won't matter. Personally I honor the opinions only of the dear people (φίλοι) who truly care about me. In general this doesn't necessarily solve the problem - after all, one could be surrounded by flatterers or fault-finders - but it does limit the scope. Moreover, although I strive to be gracious about receiving praise and open-minded about receiving criticism, I also tend to keep my own counsel about my own worth.</p>
<p>With my recent turn toward an ever-deeper personalism in mind, it strikes me that the foregoing practices are essentially a private application of the principles of intellectual honesty that Walter Kaufmann enunciated in his book <cite>The Faith of a Heretic</cite>. However, I find that they're not always easy to follow, even for someone like me who seems to be constitutionally quite immune to outside influence.</p>

<h3>2025-12-21</h3>
<p>While reading Eric Hoffer's book <cite>The Passionate State of Mind</cite>, I came across some thought-provoking aphorisms about self-knowledge, self-deception, and personal identity. Here are the key sentences, which I've extracted and strung together for my own purposes:</p>
<blockquote>Far more crucial than what we know or do not know is what we do not want to know. (§58)</blockquote>
<blockquote>To most of us nothing is so invisible as an unpleasant truth. (§59)</blockquote>
<blockquote>The weakness of a soul is proportionate to the number of truths that must be kept from it. (§61)</blockquote>
<blockquote>Our credulity is greatest concerning the things we know least about. And since we know least about ourselves, we are ready to believe all that is said about us. (§128)</blockquote>
<blockquote>When we are not governed too much by what other people think of us, we are likely to be tolerant toward the behavior and the opinions of others. So, too, when we do not crave to seem important we are not awed by the importance of others. (§134)</blockquote>
<p>As noted recently, although Hoffer had a powerful nose for generalizations about the foibles and failings of humanity, I prefer to translate such pronouncements into the personal, the particular, and (I might add) the positive.</p>
<p>Thus I ask myself:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How can I strengthen my soul by facing unpleasant truths about myself?</li>
  <li>What don't I want to know about myself?</li>
  <li>What do I falsely believe about myself because other people say it's so?</li>
  <li>Am I overly governed by what other people think of me?</li>
  <li>Do I have a craving for seeming important to other people?</li>
  <li>Am I less tolerant than I could be of other people's behavior and opinions?</li>
</ul>
<p>The attempt to answer these questions will require so much self-discipline that it'll be like a workout regimen for the soul! If I make any progress (perhaps with a little help from my friends, or even from Shakespeare), I'll report back...</p>

<h2><a href="2013.html">Philosophy and Psychology</a></h2>
<h3>2025-12-15</h3>
<p>Sometime in the next few weeks my friend Adrian Lory and I will hold a Substack Live video conversation about philosophy and psychology as complementary paths to wisdom and fulfillment. In preparation, I've been thinking up some questions about the relationship between philosophy and psychology, as well as their respective contributions to the good life. Here's what I have so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the psychological construct of subjective well-being the best measure of happiness or fulfillment? Can a person's flourishing be measured scientifically? What do we gain and lose by defining such measures?</li>
<li>Traditional philosophy was more judgmental than modern psychology (e.g., Socrates asserted that the unexamined life is not worth living, which implies that some ways of life have more worth than others). Does an emphasis on environmental factors or in-born personality dispositions as opposed to acquired character traits or virtues and vices deprive us of important insights into human behavior?</li>
<li>Both philosophy and psychology contain movements or schools of thought; how do these "isms" contribute to or detract from the underlying goal of philosophical enlightenment or psychological health?</li>
<li>Can or should psychology formulate an equivalent to Pierre Hadot's identification of philosophy as a way of life?</li>
<li>From its ancient roots, philosophy has been centered around the passionate practice of wisdom and the ideal of the sage (e.g., Socrates, Confucius, the Buddha). How does this differ from the scientific, value-neutral aspirations of psychology?</li>
<li>At the very end of the Eudemian Ethics Aristotle argues that the highest and best standard of soulcraft is to base one's choices on the cultivation of the divine aspects of personhood, where the Greek word for cultivation is therapeia. How does psychological therapy differ from this (admittedly vague) notion of philosophical therapeia?</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay tuned for details about the Substack Live session and be sure to subscribe to Adrian's Substack so that you can see what fascinating questions he's been thinking up. :-)</p>

<h2><a href="2012.html">Change and Revolution</a></h2>
<h3>2025-12-14</h3>
<p>In his book <cite>First Things, Last Things</cite>, Eric Hoffer makes some observations about change and revolution:</p>
<blockquote>We used to think that revolution is the cause of change. Actually it is the other way around: revolution is a by-product of change. Change comes first, and it is the difficulties and irritations inherent in change which set the stage for revolution. To say that revolution is the cause of change is like saying that juvenile delinquency is the cause of the change from boyhood to manhood.</blockquote>
<blockquote>[P]eople who undergo drastic change recapitulate to some degree the passage from childhood to manhood, and mass movements are in a sense the juvenile delinquency of societies going through the ordeal of change. The juvenile, then, is the archetypal man in transition. There is a family likeness between juveniles and people who migrate from one country to another, or are converted from one faith to another, or pass from one way of life to another....</blockquote>
<p>Although Hoffer's primary interest here is change and revolution in society (see also his most famous book, <cite>The True Believer</cite>), I wonder if something similar applies to individuals. Consider two quotes from Tolstoy:</p>
<blockquote>Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>There can be only one permanent revolution - a moral one: the regeneration of the inner man.</blockquote>
<p>Could it be that the inner revolution of personal regeneration is often made possible by a move to another country, joining a different faith, pursuing a new career, getting married, getting divorced, becoming a parent, or some other change in one's way of life?</p>
<p>To me it seems more likely that in these matters causation is bidirectional. After all, personal regeneration simply <em>is</em> changing oneself - or, more accurately, a change in oneself. Yevgeny Zamyatin once wrote that "there is no final revolution", which at the personal level implies that one needs to keep changing throughout life based on one's ever-widening range of insight and experience; indeed, living an examined life requires nothing less.</p>

<h2><a href="2011.html">The Universalist Temptation</a></h2>
<h3>2025-12-10</h3>
<p>The other day in my post about Making It Personal, I wrote as follows:</p>
<blockquote>I have taken to translating universal claims and observations into practices that I can apply in my own life (and ignoring them if they cannot be so translated).</blockquote>
<p>Today I'd like to focus on that last part, because over time I've found that my To-Don't List can be even more beneficial than my To-Do List.</p>
<p>It strikes me that most of the books, news articles, blog posts, advice columns, and Internet memes floating around out there are implicitly or explicitly universalist: they talk about how society needs to change, about how "we" (always undefined) need to take certain actions, about how everyone should do what the writer or influencer says, etc. Yet changing society, modifying government policy, or convincing everyone to act in a certain way is completely outside my span of influence and control.</p>
<p>Yes, I freely grant that it's awfully tempting to make such universal claims; for much of my life I did the same thing myself! However, I've learned that when I give in to this temptation I immediately start weaving a tangled web of unrealistic hopes and self-righteous expectations, which inexorably pulls me into a cycle of anger and frustration ("why don't other people do what I think they should do?!").</p>
<p>This temptation to universalism is itself nearly universal: it seems to lie at the root of politics, activism, punditry, and far too much of philosophy, psychology, religion, literary criticism, sociology, and similar disciplines.</p>
<p>For myself, I've discovered that attempting to translate universal prescriptions into personal practices provides an effective filter on the endless stream of news, advice, and propaganda; and if a source of such information is too insistent, I simply start ignoring it. And in my own writing I try to scrupulously avoid the universalist temptation.</p>
<p>Naturally, I'm not saying that you should start doing things my way or that society needs to become less universalistic, because if I did then I'd be caught in the same old web...</p>
