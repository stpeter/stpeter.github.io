<h2><a href="2002.html">Twenty-Five Years of Blogging</a></h2>
<h3>2025-11-21</h3>
<p>On this day in the year 2000, I posted the first entry in my online journal. Two thousand posts and 650,000+ words later, I'm still at it. Granted, my journal is not quite of Thoreauvian proportions: our friend Henry produced over 2 million words in 24 years of journaling (all of which I read while encountering Thoreau in preparation for composing my book <cite>The Upland Farm</cite>). Even so, I've done a lot of scribbling over the last quarter century!</p>
<p>Here's how I described the nascent endeavor back then:</p>
<blockquote>I see this space as part diary, part sandbox, and part weblog - a place to explore ideas and events on the web, in real life, and in my head. Hopefully someone other than me will find it interesting. :-)</blockquote>
<p>Some things have changed over the last 25 years: for instance, I don't know what makes a "weblog" distinctive now that so much of modern existence has moved from physical to virtual. Moreover, because I'm a pretty private person I have always shied away from treating this journal like a diary. Thus over time I've gravitated mostly to the sandbox model, in which I try ideas on for size and explore the personal implications of my readings and reflections.</p>
<p>To my mind, this journal isn't writing in a professional sense but the simple act of thinking out loud, which I find enormously helpful in pursuit of greater clarity and wisdom as I travel through life. That a few folks seemingly like to listen in on my dialogue with myself means a great deal to me.</p>
<p>Here's to the next 25 years!</p>

<h2><a href="2001.html">Giving and Receiving</a></h2>
<h3>2025-11-16</h3>
<p>Recent life circumstances have spurred me to reflect further on love as an activity, but also on love as a "passivity", as it were.</p>
<p>It strikes me that, at root, the activity of loving consists of freehearted giving, whereas the "passivity" of loving consists of gracious receiving; and, moreover, that there is beautiful nobility in both the giving and the receiving. This nobility is well captured in a poignant scene from Willa Cather's novel <cite>O Pioneers!</cite> (Part II, Chapter XII), wherein our heroine Alexandra has offered financial support to Carl, her childhood friend and intended husband, who replies: "To take what you would give me, I should have to be either a very large man or a very small one, and I am only in the middle class." (In the context, it's clear that Carl is speaking of moral classes, not monetary ones.)</p>
<p>It's noteworthy that the word "take" is used here rather than "receive", for we associate taking with character traits approaching avarice, whereas receiving requires attitudes of thankfulness for the gift and esteem for the giver. This is a significant factor in the nobility of receiving.</p>
<p>As Aristotle emphasizes in his writings on soulcraft, the ideal relationship is deeply reciprocal, characterized by freehearted giving and gracious receiving in both directions. Yet unavoidably there are situations (e.g., illness and convalescence) and times of life (esp. childhood and old age) when one receives more than one gives; philosophers of care and relationships must do justice to these, as for instance many Confucians have done. Furthermore, what's given can be of a different order than what's received; we see this in the very same scene from <cite>O Pioneers!</cite>, where Alexandra says to Carl: "What good comes of offering people things they don't need? I don't need money. But I have needed you for a great many years."</p>
<p>Thinkers as disparate as Aristotle and Nietzsche have long held that giving is more worthy than receiving because giving is more active and flows from an abundance of life and character. Indeed, there is an amusing passage in Aristotle's Ethics wherein he goes back and forth between considering it more noble to oneself do something beautiful or to give a loved one the opportunity to do the beautiful action and thus shine forth in nobility (an internal debate that perhaps only an ancient Greek could engage in!).</p>
<p>Yet, as I say, there is nobility and beauty in graciously receiving, too. There is an analogy here to the arts: the unsurpassed mastery of Sophocles, Michelangelo, Shakespeare, Vermeer, Bach, or Beethoven is a gift of wonder to all mankind, but their artworks possess continued meaning only because millions of human beings have been receptive over the course of centuries to what these artists brought into the world. The same is true of the great philosophers, scientists, reformers, and revolutionaries throughout human history. On a more intimate scale, such influence makes itself felt in every marriage, friendship, workplace, and community.</p>

<h2><a href="2000.html">A Letter</a></h2>
<h3>2025-10-17</h3>
<p>Yesterday I penned a letter to my best friend. And I do mean penned: after rummaging around in a box stashed in a closet, I tracked down some fine stationery I'd bought years ago and, pen in hand, sat down to write. Having been away from letter-writing for decades, I was reminded of a few long-forgotten essentials:</p>
<ol>
<li>Writing a letter by hand is a slow, contemplative activity. The fact that you need to think about what you're going to say before committing it to paper induces a great deal of thought and reflection.</li>
<li>This kind of slow, contemplative writing makes you think with care about the person you're writing to, in two senses: you choose your words carefully so that you can demonstrate the caring thoughts and feelings you have toward this person who is dear to you.</li>
<li>The bodily act of penning a letter leads to a subtle but perceptible embodiment of your thoughts and feelings, for instance in the words you underline or the width of your dashes. Indeed, a writer who is more visually creative than I am might include little doodles, sketch a flower or a cloud, and so on. (Thoreau did this kind of thing in his journal.)</li>
<li>Writing letters is additive; although I talk on the phone with this friend every week or two and text with him nearly every day, writing is an extra mode of communication that does not take away from these more immediately interactive activities.</li>
</ol>
<p>I foresee more letter writing in my future...</p>

<h2><a href="1999.html">Socrates and Thoreau on True Wealth</a></h2>
<h3>2025-10-14</h3>
<p>On this day in 1857, Thoreau wrote as follows in his journal:</p>
<blockquote>Was there ever such an autumn? And yet there was never such a panic and hard times in the commercial world. The merchants and banks are suspending and failing all the country over, but not the sand-banks, solid and warm, and streaked with bloody blackberry vines. You may run upon them as much as you please — even as the crickets do, and find their account in it. They are the stockholders in these banks, and I hear them creaking their content. You may see them on chance any warmer hour. In these banks, too, and such as these, are my funds deposited, a fund of health and enjoyment. Their (the crickets) prosperity and happiness and, I trust, mine do not depend on whether the New York banks suspend or no. We do not rely on such slender security as the thin paper of the Suffolk Bank. To put your trust in such a bank is to be swallowed up and undergo suffocation. Invest, I say, in these country banks. Let your capital be simplicity and contentment.</blockquote>
<p>These thoughts echo something Thoreau wrote on the first of May in that same year:</p>
<blockquote>It is foolish for a man to accumulate material wealth chiefly, houses and land. Our stock in life, our real estate, is that amount of thought which we have had, which we have thought out. The ground we have thus created is forever pasturage for our thoughts. I fall back on to visions which I have had. What else adds to my possessions and makes me rich in all lands? If you have ever done any work with these finest tools, the imagination and fancy and reason, it is a new creation, independent on the world, and a possession forever. You have laid up something against a rainy day. You have to that extent cleared the wilderness.</blockquote>
<p>While perusing Plato's <cite>Apology</cite> recently, I realized that these observations chime with something Socrates said at his trial (here in the translation that Thoreau would have read, Sydenham and Taylor 1804, volume 4, p. 213):</p>
<blockquote>I go about doing nothing else than persuading both the younger and older among you, neither to pay attention to the body, nor to riches, nor anything else prior to the soul; not to be so much concerned for any thing, as how the soul may subsist in the most excellent condition. I also say that virtue is not produced from riches, but riches from virtue, as likewise all other human goods, both privately and publicly.</blockquote>
<p>As previously noted, during his time at Walden Pond Thoreau borrowed this translation of Plato's dialogues from his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson (who also owned the woodlot where Thoreau built his cabin). His masterpiece <cite>Walden</cite> was in many ways an apologia, a defense of his way of life: not the superficialities of his two years at the pond that everyone focuses on these days, but his deep cultivation of simplicity, independence, contentment, magnanimity, wisdom, and other excellences of character. Both Socrates and Thoreau recognized that the true wealth consists not in material possessions, but in the higher riches that only soulcraft can procure for us.</p>

<h2><a href="1998.html">Private, Personal, Practical, Passionate, Particular</a></h2>
<h3>2025-10-10</h3>
<p>Following a gap of nearly forty years (!), I'm re-reading Alasdair MacIntyre's influential book <cite>After Virtue</cite>. As I do so, I'll post occasionally on the reflections it inspires.</p>
<p>Right off the bat on page 6, MacIntyre gives three examples of contemporary moral disagreement that, from my recent philosophical perspective, I find questionable: just war, abortion, and rights to health care and education.</p>
<p>Notice that these topics concern politics or public morality, they are general or impersonal, they aren't things I can take action on directly (unless I happen to have a significant role in political governance), we are supposed to deliberate about them in a disinterested or dispassionate manner, and our deliberations should result in policies or rules that are universal. Thus to my mind they are actually matters of <em>statecraft</em>.</p>
<p>Flipping these qualities around, we get a glimpse of what, by contrast, <em>soulcraft</em> is all about: those aspects of life that are private, personal, practical, passionate, and particular. Consider a few of the more momentous matters one might deliberate about in life: Is this the person I want to marry? Do we want to start a family? Is this the line of work that comprises my calling? Should I quit my job and become an entrepreneur? How can I help my best friend, who is facing a personal crisis? I suspect I'm in an abusive relationship, should I move out and start over? Is now the time for me to retire? How can I give back in my community? Is this avocation expressive of who I really am? How can I do justice to my highest potential as a human being? And so on.</p>
<p>Here's how I would unpack these qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li>The private is that which is intimate, uncommon, unknown, hidden from public view.</li>
<li>The personal is that which has meaning and significance to me as an individual.</li>
<li>The practical is that which I can take action on, and where my actions can make a real difference.</li>
<li>The passionate is that which is bound up with my feelings and emotions.</li>
<li>The particular is that which directly affects only myself and the individuals I care about.</li>
</ul>
<p>Statecraft is what most people pontificate about on social media, blogs, Substack, and the like - but what matters most in our pursuit of happiness and fulfillment is soulcraft.</p>

<h2><a href="1997.html">Soulcraft</a></h2>
<h3>2025-10-05</h3>
<p>Aristotle wrote three books with "ethics" (ἠθική) in the title, where the word ἠθική is derived from the Greek word for character (ἦθος). Yet to modern ears, "ethics" brings to mind commandments, guardrails, and other restrictions on behavior. Thus arises the question: how best to render the word ἠθική into English?</p>
<p>After much reflection, I've provisionally settled on <em>soulcraft</em>, in part because it contrasts nicely with <em>statecraft</em> as a rendering of πολιτική; politics deals with the public world of societal interaction and governance, whereas ethics deals with the private, personal world of character and cultivation of one's highest self.</p>
<p>These rather arcane matters of translation are bound up with what lately I've been calling public philosophy vs. private philosophy. Consider a beautiful statement that, according to Plato, Socrates made at his trial (<cite>Apology</cite> 29d-e, Grube translation modified):</p>
<blockquote>I shall not cease to practice philosophy, to exhort you and in my usual way to point out to any one of you whom I happen to meet: 'Good Sir, you are an Athenian and a citizen of the greatest city with the greatest reputation for sagacity [σοφία] and power; are you not ashamed of your eagerness to possess as much wealth, status, and prestige as possible, while you do not cultivate [ἐπιμελέομαι] nor give mind [φροντίζω] to wisdom [φρόνησις] or truth [ἀληθεία], or the best possible state of your soul [ψυχή]?</blockquote>
<p>Although I use the word soul, I wish to avoid misunderstandings about belief in an "immortal soul" within various religious traditions. By contrast, for Aristotle the word ψυχή meant something closer to "aliveness" (since he argued that animals and even plants have ψυχή) or, for human beings, "personhood".</p>
<p>One may wonder: since ψυχή (commonly Romanized as psyche) is the source for our word psychology, could it be that soulcraft is properly the concern of psychology rather than philosophy? More specifically, cultivating the best possible state of your soul might sound like something that the recent school of positive psychology could help you accomplish.</p>
<p>The relationship between psychology and philosophy is a large topic that I can't hope to cover with any thoroughness in one of these brief journal entries (expect further reflections in coming weeks). However, as I see it psychology and philosophy should be able to work together to clear the underbrush on this path, with further contributions from literature, anthropology, history, and biography among other disciplines, none of which has possession of the complete truth (if there even is such a thing). Soulcraft is nothing other than the great task of figuring out how to be human, and in that endless endeavor we can use all the help we can get!</p>
