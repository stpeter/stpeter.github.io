<h2><a href="2012.html">Change and Revolution</a></h2>
<h3>2025-12-14</h3>
<p>In his book <cite>First Things, Last Things</cite>, Eric Hoffer makes some observations about change and revolution:</p>
<blockquote>We used to think that revolution is the cause of change. Actually it is the other way around: revolution is a by-product of change. Change comes first, and it is the difficulties and irritations inherent in change which set the stage for revolution. To say that revolution is the cause of change is like saying that juvenile delinquency is the cause of the change from boyhood to manhood.</blockquote>
<blockquote>[P]eople who undergo drastic change recapitulate to some degree the passage from childhood to manhood, and mass movements are in a sense the juvenile delinquency of societies going through the ordeal of change. The juvenile, then, is the archetypal man in transition. There is a family likeness between juveniles and people who migrate from one country to another, or are converted from one faith to another, or pass from one way of life to another....</blockquote>
<p>Although Hoffer's primary interest here is change and revolution in society (see also his most famous book, <cite>The True Believer</cite>), I wonder if something similar applies to individuals. Consider two quotes from Tolstoy:</p>
<blockquote>Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>There can be only one permanent revolution - a moral one: the regeneration of the inner man.</blockquote>
<p>Could it be that the inner revolution of personal regeneration is often made possible by a move to another country, joining a different faith, pursuing a new career, getting married, getting divorced, becoming a parent, or some other change in one's way of life?</p>
<p>To me it seems more likely that in these matters causation is bidirectional. After all, personal regeneration simply <em>is</em> changing oneself - or, more accurately, a change in oneself. Yevgeny Zamyatin once wrote that "there is no final revolution", which at the personal level implies that one needs to keep changing throughout life based on one's ever-widening range of insight and experience; indeed, living an examined life requires nothing less.</p>

<h2><a href="2011.html">The Universalist Temptation</a></h2>
<h3>2025-12-10</h3>
<p>The other day in my post about Making It Personal, I wrote as follows:</p>
<blockquote>I have taken to translating universal claims and observations into practices that I can apply in my own life (and ignoring them if they cannot be so translated).</blockquote>
<p>Today I'd like to focus on that last part, because over time I've found that my To-Don't List can be even more beneficial than my To-Do List.</p>
<p>It strikes me that most of the books, news articles, blog posts, advice columns, and Internet memes floating around out there are implicitly or explicitly universalist: they talk about how society needs to change, about how "we" (always undefined) need to take certain actions, about how everyone should do what the writer or influencer says, etc. Yet changing society, modifying government policy, or convincing everyone to act in a certain way is completely outside my span of influence and control.</p>
<p>Yes, I freely grant that it's awfully tempting to make such universal claims; for much of my life I did the same thing myself! However, I've learned that when I give in to this temptation I immediately start weaving a tangled web of unrealistic hopes and self-righteous expectations, which inexorably pulls me into a cycle of anger and frustration ("why don't other people do what I think they should do?!").</p>
<p>This temptation to universalism is itself nearly universal: it seems to lie at the root of politics, activism, punditry, and far too much of philosophy, psychology, religion, literary criticism, sociology, and similar disciplines.</p>
<p>For myself, I've discovered that attempting to translate universal prescriptions into personal practices provides an effective filter on the endless stream of news, advice, and propaganda; and if a source of such information is too insistent, I simply start ignoring it. And in my own writing I try to scrupulously avoid the universalist temptation.</p>
<p>Naturally, I'm not saying that you should start doing things my way or that society needs to become less universalistic, because if I did then I'd be caught in the same old web...</p>

<h2><a href="2010.html">Making It Personal</a></h2>
<h3>2025-12-08</h3>
<p>My increasingly strong commitment to personalism and particularism has prompted me to make some changes in how I read, think, and act. Specifically, I have taken to translating universal claims and observations into practices that I can apply in my own life (and ignoring them if they cannot be so translated).</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the following opinion expressed by Eric Hoffer in his book <cite>First Things, Last Things</cite>: "My hunch is that to keep stable and healthy a free, affluent society must become a creative society." Universally speaking, that claim may or may not be true (it's not clear to me how we would prove it). However, if I agree with its underlying aim then there are two paths I can take.</p>
<p>The <em>public path</em> would be to advocate for a more creative society, write books and articles about the importance of beauty and the arts in human experience, donate time and money to museums and other cultural organizations, lobby the government for increased public funding of the arts, and so on.</p>
<p>The <em>private path</em>, by contrast, is simple and direct: I could <em>be more creative</em>. For instance, I could study classical guitar, compose music, write poems, pursue nature photography, observe the movements of birds and animals, read great literature, watch the sun rise and set, gaze up at the moon and stars, contemplate paintings and sculptures in my own house or at museums and galleries, learn more about the history of the arts, apply my mind to answering novel questions in philosophical aesthetics, and so on.</p>
<p>Oh wait, I already do all those things! It seems that at a deeply personal level I agree with Hoffer's claim, because I'm working to make it real in my own life - taking, however, the quiet, private path rather than the noisy, public path. Since nowadays our society seems to honor public things far above private things, we could even call this taking the road less traveled by. So far in my pursuit of human fulfillment, doing so has made all the difference.</p>

<h2><a href="2009.html">Varieties of Beauty</a></h2>
<h3>2025-12-03</h3>
<p>Beauty is not limited to the arts (indeed, art is not always beautiful, but that's another topic). This set me to thinking about the many sorts of things that we humans can call beautiful:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Atmospheric phenomena: sunsets, cloud formations, rainbows, fogs, etc.</li>
  <li>Astronomical phenomena: the moon, the stars, the Milky Way, comets, etc.</li>
  <li>Geological phenomena: mountains, valleys, deserts, islands, rock formations, etc.</li>
  <li>Materials: gold, silver, gemstones, etc.</li>
  <li>Waters: rivers, lakes, inlets, waterfalls, etc.</li>
  <li>Plants: trees, shrubs, vines, flowers, etc.</li>
  <li>Animals: dolphins, cheetahs, eagles, hummingbirds, butterflies, etc.</li>
  <li>Movements of animals: running, leaping, flying, soaring, etc.</li>
  <li>People and their parts: faces, hands, eyes, etc.</li>
  <li>Artifacts: pottery, jewelry, tools, books, cars, etc.</li>
  <li>Arts: poems, music, sculpture, painting, etc.</li>
  <li>Performances: plays, dances, concerts, etc.</li>
  <li>Buildings: houses, churches, temples, skyscrapers, etc.</li>
  <li>Events: weddings, festivals, coronations, etc.</li>
  <li>Sports and games: soccer, baseball, tennis, chess, etc.</li>
  <li>Sciences: mathematics, physics, biology, etc.</li>
  <li>Actions: giving, caring, etc.</li>
  <li>Emotions: love, affection, transcendence, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>And these are still quite general: it's not all of mathematics that we consider beautiful, but certain equations (e.g., Euler's equation and Maxwell's equations); in baseball, a well-turned double play can be a thing of beauty, but a routine fly ball not so much; and so on.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these beautiful things exhibit a wide range of attractive qualities, such as: fluidity, simplicity, intricacy, purity, polish, smoothness, sleekness, elegance, proportion, symmetry, asymmetry, line, composition, arrangement, form, structure, solidity, color, tone, rhythm, harmony, aliveness, permanence, evanescence, transcendence, earthiness, spontaneity, precision, virtuosity, imagination. It's not a mistake that some of these qualities are - or at least seem to be - at odds with each other. For instance, we might value precision and virtuosity in a musical performance, but if it's too precise it might start to feel robotic. Similarly, criteria of beauty can vary across times and cultures; as one example, in some East Asian cultures people rate symmetry less highly than people did in classical Greece.</p>
<p>The endless variety and particularity of beautiful things might make theoretical speculation more difficult, but they also give us so much celebrate and explore in the natural and human worlds.</p>

<h2><a href="2008.html">Shakespeare and Santayana on Beauty and Truth</a></h2>
<h3>2025-11-30</h3>
<p>Once more unto the breach with Santayana! (Three posts in a day on this topic were not what I expected.) Before saying goodbye to him, at least for now, I thought it would be fun to look at his use - or abuse - of Shakespeare at a crucial point in <cite>The Sense of Beauty</cite>. As Santayana leads up to this definition of beauty, he quotes Sonnet 54, which runs as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
O! how much more doth beauty beauteous seem<br>
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give.<br>
The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem<br>
For that sweet odour, which doth in it live.<br>
The canker blooms have full as deep a dye<br>
As the perfumèd tincture of the roses;<br>
Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly<br>
When summer's breath their maskèd buds discloses:<br>
But, for their virtue only is their show,<br>
They live unwoo'd, and unrespected fade;<br>
Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;<br>
Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:<br>
And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,<br>
When that shall fade, by verse distills your truth.<br>
</blockquote>
<p>As always with Shakespeare, there is so much we could say about a mere fourteen lines! But first, let's see how Santayana makes use of this poem:</p>
<blockquote>The passage from sensation to perception is gradual, and the path may be sometimes retraced: so it is with beauty and the pleasures of sensation. There is no sharp line between them, but it depends upon the degree of objectivity my feeling has attained at the moment whether I say "It pleases me," or "It is beautiful." If I am self-conscious and critical, I shall probably use, one phrase; if I am impulsive and susceptible, the other. The more remote, interwoven, and inextricable the pleasure is, the more objective it will appear; and the union of two pleasures often makes one beauty. [Here Santayana quotes all but the last two lines of Sonnet 54.] One added ornament, we see, turns the deep dye, which was but show and mere sensation before, into an element of beauty and reality, and as truth is here the co-operation of perceptions, so beauty is the co-operation of pleasures. If colour, form, and motion are hardly beautiful without the sweetness of the odour, how much more necessary would they be for the sweetness itself to become a beauty! If we had the perfume in a flask, no one would think of calling it beautiful: it would give us too detached and controllable a sensation. There would be no object in which it could be easily incorporated. But let it float from the garden, and it will add another sensuous charm to objects simultaneously recognized, and help to make them beautiful. Thus beauty is constituted by the objectification of pleasure. It is pleasure objectified. ~ <cite>The Sense of Beauty</cite>, §11</blockquote>
<p>Here Shakespeare, as is his wont, seems to draw a contrast between appearance and reality. The canker (a.k.a. dog-rose) puts on a beautiful show but lacks the sweet odour that lives in and defines the true rose; similarly, the fresh loveliness of the Fair Youth will eventually fade away, whereas the truth of his many virtues will live on in Shakespeare's artfully beautiful verses.</p>
<p>Yet Santayana sees things differently. For him, the truth about the rose (its sweet odour, which distinguishes it from the dog-rose) is merely yet another ornament which, when added to the rose's visual appearance, doubles the pleasure and therefore makes us exclaim (if we are in an extravagant mood) that the rose is beautiful. Without the corroboration of scent, we think the dog-rose is rather plain, despite its deep-dyed color, its shapely form, and its pleasing motion in the summer breezes. There is no truth to claims of beauty - it's all subjective.</p>
<p>To my mind, Santayana has twisted Shakespeare's meaning to suit the purposes of his argument. Few indeed are the beautiful things that benefit from "the cooperation of pleasures" - Beethoven's Ninth Symphony has no color, Shakespeare's sonnets don't taste delicious, and the Mona Lisa isn't wearing an expensive perfume! Although classical Greek sculptures originally possessed the added charm of paint, it's not as if the ancients could call them beautiful whereas we, missing out on their vivid colors, therefore can call them, say, mildly pleasing or merely showy. Yet that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, would it not?</p>

<h2><a href="2007.html">Art and Contemplation</a></h2>
<h3>2025-11-30</h3>
<p>Continuing my reflections on Santayana's aesthetics, I've been thinking about the contemplative significance of the arts. It's no surprise that this connection would stand out for me, given the contemplative turn I have been exploring over the last few years. I would never claim that art serves only a contemplative function, for as I mentioned in a paper I wrote twenty years ago art can do many things. Yet I think Santayana identifies something important when he observes that aesthetic experience can settle the soul, enable us to stand outside the confusions of our ephemeral existence, and bring us inner peace.</p>
<p>In addition to passages previously mentioned, I find Santayana's contrast between the beautiful and the sublime to be apropos:</p>
<blockquote>[T]he sublime is not the ugly, as some descriptions of it might lead us to suppose; it is the supremely, the intoxicatingly beautiful. It is the pleasure of contemplation reaching such an intensity that it begins to lose its objectivity, and to declare itself, what it always fundamentally was, an inward passion of the soul. For while in the beautiful we find the perfection of life by sinking into the object, in the sublime we find a purer and more inalienable perfection by defying the object altogether. The surprised enlargement of vision, the sudden escape from our ordinary interests and the identification of ourselves with something permanent and superhuman, something much more abstract and inalienable than our changing personality, all this carries us away from the blurred objects before us, and raises us into a sort of ecstasy.... The object is sublime when we forget our danger, when we escape from ourselves altogether, and live as it were in the object itself, energizing in imitation of its movement, and saying, "Be thou me, impetuous one!" This passage into the object, to live its life, is indeed a characteristic of all perfect contemplation. But when in thus translating ourselves we rise and play a higher personage, feeling the exhilaration of a life freer and wilder than our own, then the experience is one of sublimity. ~ <cite>The Sense of Beauty</cite>, §60</blockquote>
<p>Earlier in the same section, Santayana wrote as follows:</p>
<blockquote>This is the attitude of all minds to which breadth of interest or length of years has brought balance and dignity. The sacerdotal quality of old age comes from this same sympathy in disinterestedness. Old men full of hurry and passion appear as fools, because we understand that their experience has not left enough mark upon their brain to qualify with the memory of other goods any object that may be now presented. We cannot venerate any one in whom appreciation is not divorced from desire. And this elevation and detachment of the heart need not follow upon any great disappointment; it is finest and sweetest where it is the gradual fruit of many affections now merged and mellowed into a natural piety.  Indeed, we are able to frame our idea of the Deity on no other model. ~ <cite>The Sense of Beauty</cite>, §60</blockquote>
<p>As I explored in an essay I wrote years ago, the great pianist Glenn Gould made some comparable claims when he argued in favor of "ecstasy as the only proper quest for the artist", a notion which he explained this way:</p>
<blockquote>I believe that the justification of art is the internal combustion it ignites in the hearts of men and not its shallow, externalized, public manifestations. The purpose of art is not the release of a momentary ejection of adrenaline but is, rather, the gradual, lifelong construction of a state of wonder and serenity. Through the ministrations of radio and the phonograph, we are rapidly and quite properly learning to appreciate the elements of aesthetic narcissism - and I use that word in its best sense - and are awakening to the challenge that each man contemplatively create his own divinity. ~ <cite>The Glenn Gould Reader</cite>, p. 246</blockquote>
<p>Is it only the more quiet, meditative works of art that induce this "state of wonder and serenity"? My own experience leads me to think that's not necessarily the case. It's true that, because I am a contemplative sort of person, I happen to be partial to such works (musical examples include Bach's Cello Suites, Erik Satie's Gymnopedies, Billy Strayhorn's Lotus Blossom, and Joni Mitchell's Blue album); however, I experience just as much wonder, albeit of a different sort, in listening to rousing, energetic pieces of music such as Antonin Dvořak's New World Symphony, Duke Ellington's Diminuendo in Blue and Crescendo in Blue, Yes's Close to the Edge, and the upbeat songs of Aretha Franklin. Similar considerations apply to novels, poems, paintings, and other art forms.</p>
<p>Riffing on Gould, we might say the key is not whether a work of art produces a dramatic explosion or a slow burn, but whether it sparks a fire in the first place; and that depends on the intensity with which it concentrates the light of truth so as to generate a memorably vivid image of the ideal.</p>
