<h2><a href="1714.html">Live Long and Prosper</a></h2>
<h3>2022-05-05</h3>
<p>Recently I came across a study entitled "Longevity increased by positive self-perceptions of aging" (Levy et al. 2002 - apparently Becca Levy has a new book out entitled <cite>Breaking the Age Code</cite>, which I have not read yet). The abstract states: "This research found that older individuals with more positive self-perceptions of aging, measured up to 23 years earlier, lived 7.5 years longer than those with less positive self-perceptions of aging. This advantage remained after age, gender, socioeconomic status, loneliness, and functional health were included as covariates." As Spock would say: fascinating!</p>
<p>Because America is such a youth-oriented (perhaps even youth-obsessed) society, we tend to have negative perceptions of older people and of aging in general. Yet aging is part of living, and a truly biocentric philosophy should do justice to the full span of life. To be sure, there are things one might not eagerly look forward to (health issues, losing loved ones, etc.), just as there are things one might not fondly look back on from one's early life (bad decisions, foolish actions, etc.). But on balance there are many positive opportunities for flourishing and prospering as one gets older: opportunities to engage in lifelong learning, to master new skills, to pursue a long-delayed avocation, to complete passion projects, to deepen one's relationships, to become a grandparent, to travel, to tend one's garden literally or figuratively, to impart knowledge to younger generations, to reap the compounding effects of wisdom, and so on. The last of these is especially relevant to philosophy as a way of life, because there's no inherent limit to the acquisition and practice of wisdom.</p>
<p>Live long and prosper, indeed!</p>

<h2><a href="1713.html">Philosophical Forms and Functions</a></h2>
<h3>2022-05-03</h3>
<p>Following up on my post a few months ago about philosophical professionalism, I've been thinking about the many forms of philosophical writing and their functions in our intellectual and practical life. Throughout history, philosophical questions and answers have been presented in so many written forms: aphorisms, dialogues, essays, letters, allegories, parables, stories, novels, plays, poems, lectures, sermons, manifestos, journals, memoirs, biographies, autobiographies, epitomes, proofs, puzzles, thought experiments, dissertations, treatises, and scholarly papers. Yet it's only the last few of these that are acceptable these days in academic philosophy. Even a widely-cited essay like Thomas Nagel's "What Is it Like to Be a Bat?" probably wouldn't get published in an academic journal these days, and that's a shame.</p>
<p>These various forms of philosophical writing serve an equally wide variety of philosophical functions: wondering, exploring, observing, analyzing, summarizing, persuading, justifying, proving, exhorting, exemplifying, reminding, distilling, combating, warning, consoling, guiding, and so on. Here again, the modern culture of theoretical philosophy isn't interested in all of these functions, and likely doesn't consider them all of them to be philosophical in the first place - even though they were pursued by foundational thinkers in philosophical traditions both West and East.</p>
<p>Even deeper, there's the question of written vs. oral discourse. Socrates, of course, was famous for not writing anything down, because he believed that the love and practice of wisdom comes to life only in the back-and-forth of human conversation. You can't ask questions of, and receive answers, from a book! Plato tried to overcome the limitations of writing by creating dialogues that were an imitation of real-life Socratic conversations (indeed, in the <cite>Poetics</cite> Aristotle called such dialogues a form of representational art).</p>
<p>Although I try to keep my blog posts fairly conversational, they're no substitute for <em>actual</em> conversation. Whether you're interested in my philosophical coaching services or just want to explore the issues I raise here, I always welcome you to contact me via email, LinkedIn, or even the dreaded Twitter (which I log into only a few times a year!).</p>

<h2><a href="1712.html">Wisdom and Freedom</a></h2>
<h3>2022-04-28</h3>
<p>Why do we continue to find such value in the life wisdom of ancient philosophers like Socrates, Aristotle, Confucius, Lao Tzu, Siddhartha Gautama, Epicurus, and Epictetus? It's not as if we're still reading Ptolemy on astronomy or even Euclid on geometry, so why have these philosophical insights endured?</p>
<p>In the first chapter of his book <cite>The Pursuit of Unhappiness</cite>, Daniel Haybron makes a fascinating observation: the ancient philosophers deeply pondered the nature of happiness and the good life because they thought that most people make a mess of things! In some sense it's the very elitism of these philosophers that gives their wisdom lasting value.</p>
<p>By contrast, we moderns are much more egalitarian: we think that everyone is an expert at living their own life. Because individual freedom is our highest value, we don't tend to produce great new insights into how best to live. (An alternative explanation might be that there are only so many ways to live, and most of them were identified in the early wisdom traditions.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, given the prevalence of depression, divorce, drug addiction, and other sources of sadness, it's clear that we moderns aren't necessarily experts at living. Furthermore, our so-called experts (writers of self-help books and the like) often offer shallow advice consisting of life hacks and happy talk.</p>
<p>It seems to me that there's got to be a way to marry the best of ancient wisdom traditions and modern freedom traditions. I'm hopeful that trends like positive psychology and philosophical personalism are leading in that direction, but there's a lot more work to be done in weaving these various strands together into a beautiful and lasting tapestry.</p>

<h2><a href="1711.html">Exploring Social Space</a></h2>
<h3>2022-04-24</h3>
<p>One of the insights I find so intriguing from ecological psychology as developed by James and Eleanor Gibson is the concept of exploring visual space. Animals (including we humans) aren't simplistic sensory processing machines that are fixed to a point in space; instead, we are free to move around in order to see things from multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>Consider a simple object like the blue mug on my desk.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blue-mug.jpg"></p>
<p>If you were limited to viewing this mug from only one particular angle, it's possible that all you'd see is a blotch of blue. But because you can move around the mug or move the mug around, you can easily discover that the mug has a handle (an affordance for gripping it), that it's hollow inside with a solid bottom (an affordance for filling it with liquid), etc.</p>
<p>An analogy I'd like to think about further is the exploration of social space, with its associated discovery of what I recently called social affordances (of course there are other kinds of space, such as natural space, intellectual space, and inner space). From birth we humans are continually engaged in social learning by pushing against constraints, accomodating ourselves to interpersonal realities, trying new behaviors, building new relationships, formulating new goals, and modifying our thoughts, priorities, actions, and reactions based on what we've learned (consider activities like "the terrible twos", adolescent acting out, dating, travel, and early-career job hopping). And we do this in every domain of social life: family, friendships, school, work, community, etc. Indeed, I'm coming to see that a great deal of human existence consists in the exploration and navigation of social space.</p>
<p>What are the implications? They're not fully clear to me because I'm no expert in the fields of sociology, anthropology, or social psychology. However, as with everything else, different people do a better or worse job at this task of living (consider those with "dark triad" personality traits who manipulate family members or co-workers) and experience plays a large role because it takes years to figure out how to navigate the social world (human psychology and relationships are complicated!).</p>

<h2><a href="1710.html">Likeability</a></h2>
<h3>2022-04-21</h3>
<p>I seem to be getting into a rhythm of posting new thoughts on Thursdays - given my usual subject matter, we could think of this as "Thriving Thursday"...</p>
<p>Anyway, because human beings are social animals, a particularly meaningful interpersonal affordance for us is likeability. Few people are such curmudgeons that they actively want to be disliked! Yet there can be a fine line between being likeable or wanting to be liked in the right ways vs. feeling an overwhelming <em>need</em> to be liked.</p>
<p>In Book VIII, Chapter 8 of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>, Aristotle describes friendliness or likeability as an excellence of character that is opposed to surliness on the one hand and flattery on the other. He notes that most people enjoy being liked because it's a sign of being honored or valued by other people. Naturally, there's a question of who exactly you want to like you: Do you want your enemies to like you? People you don't respect? Everyone? You can't please all the people all the time, so you need to make some choices about whose esteem you value.</p>
<p>As always, it's essential to find a beautifully right balance, here between not caring enough about whether other people like you and caring too much in a needy manner. Of course there are considerations of simple prudence: in order to get ahead in life you need to get along with others, especially in modern, team-based working environments but also in your neighborhood, community, profession, family, and so on (while recognizing that these interpersonal contexts can be unhealthy, manipulative, or downright toxic). We might think of a balanced concern with others' opinions as a kind of self-possession. Many ancient philosophers, including Socrates, Aristotle, Epicurus, and the Stoics counseled this quality. Yet self-possession can easily verge off into a haughty attitude, just as the desire to be liked can verge off into a fawning attitude.</p>
<p>It seems to me that being liked or not liked isn't primary because, as the Stoics would say, it's outside your control. Instead, consider that old line from Shakespeare's <cite>Hamlet</cite>: to thine own self be true. That is: hold to your own principles of conduct so that you'll keep from going astray. For instance, if you're a manager in an organization, you might be tempted to make your employees happy at any cost (full pay with no work!). Yet that would be a recipe for disaster, because they each have their own standards of happiness (fairness matters), your organization insists on results (productivity matters), you might get demoted (success matters), etc.</p>
<p>One last thought: what someone likes today might not be what they like or appreciate 20 years from now. Many of us recall a parent, teacher, or manager who set high standards and challenged us to go beyond what was easy. The experience of meeting those expectations might not have been fun or pleasant at the time, but your future self probably thanks you for having expanded your capabilities back then. In our world of immediate feedback and the ever-lamentable "like button" it can be difficult to maintain this kind of long-term perspective, which is why having your own stable principles and worldview is so important.</p>

<h3>2022-04-14</h3>
<p>As I mentioned a few months ago in my post "Idealism and Identity", personal identity is, paradoxically, often a social construct. Here I'd like to dig more deeply into why that's the case, but without straying too far into theoretical matters because I like to provide practical insights in my blog posts.</p>
<p>For many years now I've been intrigued by the ecological account of perception developed by the husband-and-wife team of J.J. Gibson and Eleanor Gibson. One of their key concepts was that of affordances, which Donald Norman and others have popularized in the field of human-computer interaction. As my friend Jackie Ralston summarized it in a recent blog post, "Affordances are perceivable opportunities for action in an environment that are specific to an organism."</p>
<p>In English, perceptual affordances are often expressed with words ending in -able or -ible: this path is walkable, those berries are edible, that water is potable, etc. With greater experience of life, concepts like this start to extend to the social aspects of human life in all its variety: this product is marketable, that bachelor is eligible, bribery is a fireable offense, etc. As the phenomena involved become more complex, rational explanation becomes more crucial (exactly why is this product marketable?) and values come into play, leading to English words ending in -worthy (this boat is seaworthy, that person is trustworthy, etc.).</p>
<p>Much of the glue of human interaction comes from the sorts of personal evaluations we make every day: this employee is reliable, that child is likeable, etc. Because human beings are social animals (as Aristotle observed long ago), one's self-conception is often bound up with one's perception of how one is evaluated by others. Terms for the relevant traits are common in personality theory and folk psychology: someone can be agreeable, likeable, dependable, excitable, incorrigible, incorruptible, etc. Such words all have social significance. (At the same time, some character traits are not primarily social: consider qualities like curiosity, vitality, spirituality, or wisdom.)</p>
<p>It strikes me that one of the challenges of life is not allowing social affordances and perceptions to completely swamp your personal identity. Yes, we are social creatures, so social interactions are inevitably significant in your family, friendships, workplace, and community; but they are not everything and it's essential to discover a beautifully right balance between pleasing others and pleasing yourself, as it were.</p>
