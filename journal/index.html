<h2><a href="1982.html">AI and I</a></h2>
<h3>2025-08-21</h3>
<p>With all the Sturm und Drang about so-called artificial intelligence right now, I'd like to make it clear that I don't use these technologies. For me, the primary consideration is not that AI will, on balance, degrade humanity's already weakened ability to engage in independent thinking and humane interaction (although I think evidence is mounting that this will be the case). No, I simply find these technologies <em>uninteresting</em>.</p>
<p>My aspiration in life is to become an excellent human being and to find personal fulfillment: doing right by the people I care about, creating some beautiful works of art, and achieving some measure of sagacity. Based on a few experiments I undertook last year and on my understanding of how large language models work, AI has no role to play in these lifelong pursuits of mine.</p>
<p>I recognize that some people use AI to manage their relationships and work more productively on their projects; perhaps someday (even someday relatively soon) most people in advanced societies will do the same. But I'm not some people or most people: I am myself. And I'm committed to, devoted to, in love with the sheer <em>activities</em> of living: not the product but the process, not the answers but the quest, not the destination but the way.</p>
<p>All of my books, poems, musical compositions, and journal entries are, and will remain, 100% natural and organic - no artificial intelligence added.</p>

<h2><a href="1981.html">Imitation and Individuality</a></h2>
<h3>2025-08-20</h3>
<blockquote>All art is only done by the individual. The individual is all you ever have and all schools only serve to classify their members as failures. ~ Ernest Hemingway, <cite>Death in the Afternoon</cite>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Anybody can write like somebody else, but it takes a long time to get to write like yourself... ~ Ernest Hemingway, <cite>"Notes on Life and Letters"</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>These propositions, quoted in Albert Murray's book <cite>The Blue Devils of Nada</cite>, "preclude imitation in favor of individuality", as Murray observes. Here I'm especially interested in Hemingway's statement that schools of art <em>serve to classify their members as failures</em>. What exactly does that mean?</p>
<p>My interpretation is that schools of art - and, I might add, schools of philosophy - set forth theoretical archetypes for what a person is to create or how a person is to live. Too often, the leaders - and sometimes especially the followers - within a school or movement judge others for falling short of the ideal, for building things not defined in the blueprint, for creating and living in ways that aren't according to plan.</p>
<p>Yet the artist, the thinker, the individual human being exists not to follow the rules or paint within the lines, but to experience life completely and then out of that experience to shape something meaningful.</p>
<p>To be clear, this fundamental personalism does not exclude the possibility and often the necessity of collaboration, interaction, and interdependence: writers work with editors and publishers, playwrights work with actors and directors, sculptors work with foundries and gallery owners, composers work with performers, and so on. But at their best all of these folks work together as creative individuals, not as interchangeable representatives or enforcers of some constraining ideology.</p>

<h2><a href="1980.html">Thinking Historically</a></h2>
<h3>2025-08-16</h3>
<blockquote>Historians have a heavy responsibility not merely to teach people substantive historical truths but also to teach them how to think historically. ~ David Hackett Fischer</blockquote>
<p>Over the last few months I've read three books by my favorite historian, David Hackett Fischer: <cite>Historians' Fallacies: Toward a Logic of Historical Thought</cite> (1970), <cite>Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America</cite> (my third reading of this book, published in 1989), and <cite>African Founders: How Enslaved People Expanded American Ideals</cite> (2022).</p>
<p>Focusing here only on his methodology and not on the "substantive historical truths" he has revealed, Fischer sees himself as an empiricist, who strives to avoid the many misuses of history by asking open-ended questions that can be answered through well-reasoned explanations of judiciously selected facts about the human past.</p>
<p>Although an empirical approach to history sounds straightforwardly scientific, Fischer's copious catalogue of fallacies indicates that it's quite difficult to achieve: all too many historians twist the facts, ask inherently unanswerable questions, tell just-so stories, entertain without edifying, glorify or rebuke those who lived before our time, grind ideological or activist axes, etc.</p>
<p>Yet the longer I live and reflect, the more I appreciate the importance of historical knowledge in understanding "present trends and future tendencies" (Fischer 1970, p. 136). Every society has problems, and history can help us see them for what they are; it can also help us see the range of potential solutions (or, as Bertrand de Jouvenel said, the range of provisional "settlements" - for no societal problem is ever truly <em>solved</em>, since settlements necessarily involve what Thomas Sowell called "tradeoffs" and those can change over time in various ways). Specifically, historical insights can help us see which settlements and tradeoffs might be most workable in our present context - by asking questions such as this one from Fischer: "what, for example, are the historical conditions in which social stability, social freedom, and social equality have tended to be maximally coexistent?" (Fischer 1970, p. 315).</p>
<p>The foregoing uses of history are quite substantial, but it is another use that I find most meaningful: "historical scholarship can usefully serve to help us find out who we are" (ibid.). This use of history has its roots in ancient Greek historians like Herodotus, Thucydides, and Dionysius of Halicarnasus - who said that "history is philosophy teaching by examples". Fischer takes this to mean that historians should sit in judgment over people in the past, but he misunderstands what the Greeks meant by philosophy as the love of wisdom and the pursuit of self-knowledge (the famous γνῶθι σαυτόν from the temple of Apollo at Delphi). Indeed, this is just the kind of historical insight that Fischer excels at, especially in <cite>Albion's Seed</cite> and <cite>African Founders</cite>, which have helped me and no doubt thousands of others to understand America in its complexity, its high ideals, its repeated failings, and its ever-present potential for renewal and reform.</p>
<p>Ironically, Fischer is quite critical of anything like a philosophical approach to history, but I'm out of words for today so I'll have to write about that some other time.</p>

<h2><a href="1979.html">Words, Words, Words</a></h2>
<h3>2025-08-15</h3>
<p>Here's something I'm struggling with: if talk is cheap and values are overrated, what's the worth of writing?</p>
<p>For various reasons, I find I have less to say these days, as I focus on the personal world of family, friends, colleagues, neighbors, and some music composition projects I'm working on. Yes, I'm still reading voraciously in and about history, literature, philosophy, music, etc. - and talking about these readings with a few friends - but I seem less inclined to write about these matters. One possibility is that I'm merely waiting for my reflections to gestate into something worth publishing; alternatively, perhaps I'm moving more in the direction of thinkers like Socrates and Pyrrho who never wrote anything at all. Time will tell.</p>
<p>In the meantime, posting might be more sporadic than usual.</p>

<h2><a href="1978.html">Personal World</a></h2>
<h3>2025-08-04</h3>
<p>Back in May, Discourse magazine published a fine essay by Martin Gurri entitled "My Moral Sphere". Consistent with my own stance toward life, Gurri argued that ethics is not what you profess about national or global issues, but how you treat the people around you. Here's his summary:</p>
<blockquote>My moral sphere is a small world, a limited space. The necessary virtues aren't complex: <em>humility</em> with my family, <em>integrity</em> at work, <em>neighborliness</em> in my community - add <em>loyalty</em> to friends, and one has the basic package.</blockquote>
<p>Although I might modify or expand his list, the core focus seems right to me. My moral sphere is a <em>personal world</em>, filled with individuals whom I endeavor to treat with dignity, respect, kindness, and love. It sounds so simple, yet anyone who has had to deal with a disruptive neighbor, backstabbing co-worker, abusive family member, or false friend knows that the personal world is the hardest of all.</p>

<h2><a href="1977.html">Values Are Overrated</a></h2>
<h3>2025-07-31</h3>
<p>Modern society is filled with incessant talk about the importance of good values. Yet talk is cheap and values are overrated. Much more important than values are commitments, practices, and actions.</p>
<p>To choose a few examples: it's easy for me to <em>say</em> that I value human freedom, interpersonal empathy, aesthetic excellence, and intellectual honesty. Yet am I deeply committed to those things? Have I built up practices for achieving them? Do I consistently take action to bring them into reality?</p>
<p>Inevitably, so much of what I read online is just words, words, words. And, to be clear, I'm as guilty as the rest! But if the unit of greatness in philosophy is a life, then whatever values I voice pale in comparison to the commitments I put into practice through recurrent actions in the context of both my long-term projects and my relationships with family, friends, workmates, and neighbors. Most everything else is, as Shakespeare said, sound and fury, signifying nothing.</p>
