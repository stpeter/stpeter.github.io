<h2><a href="1910.html">Beowulf</a></h2>
<h3>2024-10-13</h3>
<p>As part of my background research for composing an epic poem about Pyrrho, I'm reading epics from around the world. So far this year I've read both the <cite>Iliad</cite> and the <cite>Odyssey</cite> twice (in Richmond Lattimore's masterful translations), Milton's <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>, the <cite>Argonautica</cite> by Apollonius of Rhodes, and most recently <cite>Beowulf</cite>. I'm also about halfway through Virgil's <cite>Aeneid</cite> (in John Dryden's translation), after which I intend to start on Ferdowsi's great Persian epic, the <cite>Shahnameh</cite>. I'm also halfway through my friend Dave Jilk's newly published science-fiction novel in the form of an epic poem, entitled <cite>Epoch: A Poetic Psy-Phi Saga</cite> (more on that soon). And there are plenty more where these came from!</p>
<p>Before diving into <cite>Beowulf</cite> for the first time since high school, I decided to read <cite>Translating Beowulf</cite> by Old English scholar Hugh Magennis. There are so many translations of <cite>Beowulf</cite> from Old English into Modern English that I wanted to choose one which, roughly speaking and <em>mutatis mutandis</em>, is consistent with Matthew Arnold's principles for translating Homer. All indications were that the translation to read - at least for me - was made by Michael Alexander for Penguin Classics, and his version did not disappoint.</p>
<p>Two aspects of the poem stood out for me. First, the high heroism of the story: Beowulf himself is portrayed not only as an accomplished and courageous warrior, but also as an exceptionally wise and ethical person. Second, the artistry of the verse: different from the purely syllabic verse of Homer and Virgil, and again from the accentual-syllabic verse of Milton and other Modern English poets, but quite gorgeous in its use of half-lines, alliteration, metaphors, formulae, and kennings (striking ways of describing everyday phenomena, such as calling the sea "the whale's road"). As far as I can tell, Michael Alexander did a great job of representing these various features of the Old English poem into his verse translation, which I expect I'll read again to absorb poetic insights that I might use in my "Pyrrhiad".</p>

<h2><a href="1909.html">Middlemarch</a></h2>
<h3>2024-10-12</h3>
<p>The other day I finished reading George Eliot's novel <cite>Middlemarch</cite>. This was my second attempt, since a few years ago I had made it about halfway through but then got distracted with other projects. <cite>Middlemarch</cite> is widely considered one of the greatest novels in the English language, and I can't disagree. The aspect that most impresses me is Eliot's deep understanding of human character, emotion, and deliberation, for good and for ill. As befits Eliot's intellectual interests (she was the first to translate Spinoza's <cite>Ethics</cite> from Latin into English), that understanding is simultaneously both psychological and philosophical. I love how she provides ethical insights at just the right moments in the narrative: "character too is a process and an unfolding"; "character is not cut in marble - it is not something solid and unalterable. It is something living and changing, and may become diseased as our bodies do"; "every limit is a beginning as well as an ending"; "there is no creature whose inward being is so strong that it is not greatly determined by what lies outside it"; "is there not a genius for feeling nobly which also reigns over human spirits?" (etc.). British novelist Robert McCrum once called <cite>Middlemarch</cite> "a cathedral of words" and it certainly is long (my copy, printed in the 1920s, clocks in around 1350 pages, although more modern editions are around 800). Yet Eliot needed that vast structure to house the many fascinating characters she created, to portray their interrelationships, and to resolve their conflicts. Brava!</p>

<h2><a href="1908.html">Walking with Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics VIII.1-5</a></h2>
<h3>2024-10-11</h3>
<p>Books VIII and IX of the Nicomachean Ethics are devoted to <em>philia</em>. The translators all say this word means friendship - but I think they're wrong. According to Aristotle, the paradigm case of <em>philia</em> is a mother's love for her children (1161b27). Going out on a limb (as I am wont to do), I therefore render <em>philia</em> as <em>love</em>.</p>
<p>Why does Aristotle dedicate one-fifth of the Nicomachean Ethics to love? In the first sentence of Book VIII, he asserts that love is a kind of virtue [aretē tis] or suffused with virtue [met' aretēn], and that it is most necessary for our way of life [bios]. Because human beings are social animals, all of our goals and activities take on greater significance if they are pursued and shared with other people - especially the people who are dear to us and with whom we live, work, think, feel, and act.</p>
<p>Hearkening back to his earlier analysis of the good, Aristotle looks into "what is loved" (philētos) and distinguishes three kinds: what is useful [chrēsimos], what is enjoyable [hēdu], and what is good [agathos]. Thus there are three associated kinds of personal relationship: that based on usefulness (e.g., work colleagues), that based on enjoyment (e.g., poker buddies), and that based on goodness of character (e.g., best friends). The first two kinds tend to be unstable and relatively short-lived, since what we find pleasant or useful can change over time, as can our emphasis on one or the other at different times of life: younger people seek what's enjoyable and older people seek what's useful.</p>
<p>By contrast, the complete [teleia] kind of love exists between people who are good in themselves and similar in excellence of character, since they wish what's best for each other and take action to make it so. Because character is stable and long-lasting, so is the relationship rooted in good character. The individuals who share in such a relationship certainly benefit from it and enjoy it, but use and pleasure are not the purpose of their love.</p>
<p>A close relationship like this is not merely a feeling of mutual goodwill and affection, though. Its completeness is further enhanced by time, intimate acquaintance [sunētheia], mutual disclosure, trust, shared activities, and frequent or continual proximity.</p>
<p>Indeed, just as with excellence of character, so too love can be seen from two perspectives: that of the underlying trait [hexis] and that of the living activity [energeia]. Although the trait is a necessary foundation, the activity that expresses the trait is more primary and more significant, for activity involves commitment [prohairesis] and commitment in turn flows from deliberation and is suffused with our thoughts and values.</p>
<p>Such is the ideal of Aristotelian love as sketched out in Nicomachean Ethics VIII.1-5. In the remainder of Book VIII and in Book IX, Aristotle will consider a number of qualifications and complexities with regard to human relationships, since not all of our interactions exemplify the ideal. More on that next time.</p>

<h2><a href="1907.html">Void for Vagueness</a></h2>
<h3>2024-10-08</h3>
<p>In yesterday's post about philosophical hubris, I mentioned Alexandre Lefebvre's proposal to regard liberalism as a way of life. Astute readers might have noticed that words like liberalism, neoliberalism, and fascism don't appear prominently in my writings. Beyond the fact that I tend to avoid political topics, there's another reason: I find these words to be extremely slippery. Indeed, they are often so ill-defined as to be void for vagueness, which might be why it's so easy to hurl them as epithets. Yet isms are not the only such words in our increasingly partisan culture. Similar in their effects are terms like feminazi, Islamophobic, woke, denier, and a host of others. If you think about them carefully, can you be sure that they provide a solid basis for clear thinking, mutual understanding, and respectful communication? I have my doubts...</p>

<h2><a href="1906.html">Philosophical Hubris</a></h2>
<h3>2024-10-07</h3>
<p>In further reflecting on my recent post about criticism vs. cultivation, I've been pondering the all-too-common phenomenon of philosophical hubris: the attitude among some philosophers that they can pronounce intelligently on any topic or situation presented to them. To such thinkers (parodied as long ago as Plato's <cite>Gorgias</cite>), humility might be an intellectual virtue for others, but it isn't one for <em>them</em>.</p>
<p>As I see it, philosophical hubris is one of the dangers inherent in the proliferation of various isms as "ways of life" - Stoicism, Epicureanism, Pyrrhonism, even (if Alexandre Lefebvre is to be believed) political ideologies like liberalism. As Abraham Maslow is reputed to have said, "if all you have is a hammer then everything looks like a nail" - and you feel free to whack it accordingly. Poor Pierre Hadot, who resurrected the conception of philosophy as a way life: loving and pursuing wisdom is very different from believing and adhering to a particular worldview that provides the answers to all questions.</p>
<p>Yet the true believer is not the only intellectual type who is prone to pontificating. Sophists ancient and modern (e.g., all too many analytic philosophers) have felt confident that their logical and rhetorical training qualifies them to argue successfully about everything under the sun.</p>
<p>I freely admit that in my youth I epitomized this kind of arrogance. In college, when I was considering psychotherapy as a career, a friend of mine reacted by saying "you just want to tell people what to do"; although I was taken aback, at that time there was much truth in the accusation. Having worked at character improvement over many years, hopefully I've mostly outgrown it by now!</p>
<p>To counteract this tendency, I find it helpful to recall the words of Lao Tzu in the final chapter of the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
The wise man doesn't know it all<br>
The know-it-all is far from wise
</blockquote>

<h2><a href="1905.html">Whole Wheat Pancake Recipe</a></h2>
<h3>2024-10-05</h3>
<p>Every once in a while I post a recipe here, almost as much for my own reference as for sharing. Because several people have asked me about my whole wheat pancakes recently, I figured I'd write up how I make them.</p>
<p>There are two sets of ingredients, five wet and five dry:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zest of one orange</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>6 tablespoons canola oil</li>
<li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
<li>¼ cup heavy cream</li>
<li>2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
<li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
<li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
</ul>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk all the dry ingredients. In a smaller mixing bowl, whisk all the wet ingredients. Whisk the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until just mixed and no dry spots remain. Spoon out ¼ cup of batter at a time onto a warm pan or griddle, flip when bubbles start to appear, and serve with maple syrup or your favorite sweetener (orange marmalade is a great choice). Makes 16-18 pancakes.</p>
<p>I use heavy cream because I prefer thick pancakes - substitute with milk if you prefer them thinner. And for a delightfully nutty flavor, use walnut oil instead of canola oil.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
