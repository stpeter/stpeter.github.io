<h2><a href="1969.html">Learning Excellence</a></h2>
<h3>2025-06-10</h3>
<p>In my post about Alisdair MacIntyre the other day, I expressed admiration for his recognition that we need to learn the principles of action from the practices life. Here is a quote on the topic from his last essay:</p>
<blockquote>We need to begin again and to do so by returning to the social context in which we learned the use of good and its cognates. What we first had to learn was how to make the distinctions between what we desire and the choiceworthy, and between what pleases those others whom we desire to please and the choiceworthy. We characteristically and generally learn — or fail to learn — to make these distinctions, as we emerge through and from the family into the life of a variety of practices: such practices as those of housework and farmwork, of learning Latin and geometry, of building houses and making furniture, of playing soccer and playing in string quartets. What we can learn only in and through such practices is what the standards of excellence are in each type of activity and how our desires and feelings must be disciplined and transformed and our choices guided by the standards of excellence in each type of activity if we are to achieve such excellence and through it the goods internal to each type of practice.</blockquote>
<p>I might add that what we learn through these practices and activities is first and foremost that <em>there is such a thing as excellence</em>. As Aristotle put it at the very beginning of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>: "Every craft and every inquiry, and similarly every action and commitment, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things aim."</p>
<p>It was Socrates whom Aristotle followed in frequently asking not only "what is this thing?" (e.g., in Plato's <cite>Republic</cite> "what is justice?") but also "does this thing exist?" The latter question is more fundamental, because if a thing is nonexistent (say, unicorns or centaurs) then it doesn't make sense to puzzle over its nature and identity. But once we have the experience of excellence - say, witnessing athletic excellence at the ancient Olympic games or dramatic excellence at the Athnenian Great Dionysia - then we can start to talk about it, think about it, give an account of it, define its standards, compare examples of it, seek commonalities in excellence across different forms of craft and inquiry, and so on.</p>
<p>Moreover, I would posit that the best way to learn excellence is from the inside. As we say nowadays, "life is not a spectator sport" - and neither is excellence. To take a personal example: while it's true that I'll never be nearly as great a guitar player as my musical heroes (such as Julian Bream, Steve Howe, and Michael Hedges), it's also true that I have gained a stronger grasp of excellent playing by striving to improve my guitar skills, in part by attempting to emulate their excellence. The same principle applies in the visual arts (which is why at museums you sometimes see students painting works by the Old Masters), dance, tennis, woodworking, the experimental sciences, medicine, law, warfighting, etc. The basic rule is that one's knowledge becomes stronger to the extent that it is <em>embodied</em> and thus turned into a kind of second nature.</p>
<p>All of this takes time, for life is a process of ripening. This is one reason why philosophical reflection and instruction is somewhat wasted on the young. It is said that at Plato's Academy, students of philosophy could not begin the curriculum until they were forty years of age (and even then they had to start off with years of mathematics) - before that, they simply didn't have enough experience of life to make it worthwhile. MacIntyre echoed this sentiment in his focus on learning principles from practices. Thoreau said something similar in <cite>Walden</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>The student who secures his coveted leisure and retirement by systematically shirking any labor necessary to man obtains but an ignoble and unprofitable leisure, defrauding himself of the experience which alone can make leisure fruitful. "But," says one, "you do not mean that the students should go to work with their hands instead of their heads?" I do not mean that exactly, but I mean something which he might think a good deal like that; I mean that they should not play life, or study it merely, while the community supports them at this expensive game, but earnestly live it from beginning to end. How could youths better learn to live than by at once trying the experiment of living? Methinks this would exercise their minds as much as mathematics.</blockquote>

<h2><a href="1968.html">Living on the Margins</a></h2>
<h3>2025-06-08</h3>
<p>While reading today the final essay published by Alisdair MacIntyre, I was struck by the following two passages:</p>
<blockquote>[J]ust as Aristotelian moral and political theory provides us with resources for interpreting and redirecting our practical lives, so too our practical experience provides us with reasons for criticizing and sometimes rejecting some of Aristotle’s own concepts, theses, and arguments. We learn to identify that in Aristotle which derives from the limitations and prejudices of Athenian and Macedonian elites. So we develop Aristotle beyond Aristotle and in so doing may find — as I found — that our Aristotelianism has had to become that of Aquinas.</blockquote>
<p>and:</p>
<blockquote>Two salient thoughts emerge from this narrative. The first concerns the importance for the moral philosopher of living on the margins, intellectually as well as politically, a necessary condition for being able to see things as they are. The two standpoints without which I would have been unable to understand either modern morality or twentieth-century moral philosophy are those of Thomism and of Marxism....</blockquote>
<p>I agree that most of (what we perceive as) Aristotle's faults derive from the "limitations and prejudices of Athenian and Macedonian elites" - or, more broadly, from the significant differences betweeen classical Greece and the 21st-century Anglosphere, as well as the simple passage of time and advancement of science and history since then. Yet I find it curious to focus on the motes in the eyes of the ancient elites rather than the beams in the eyes of current elites. To my mind, two of those modern beams are Christianity and Marxism, the very foundations of MacIntyre's outsider perspective!</p>
<p>As previously noted, I plan to revisit MacIntyre's work in the years ahead, so I don't want to pre-judge what I might find there. However, I have to wonder if there might be more constructive "margins" from which to gain a clearer sense of the way things are today; aside from Aristotelianism itself, there certainly are plenty of vantage points to choose from, such as Buddhism and Pyrrhonism in philosophy, classical liberalism in political economy, and numerous strands of research in psychology such as evolutionary psychology, ecological psychology, and humanistic psychology.</p>
<p>More positively, I should add that I perceive much to like in this last essay of MacIntyre's, especially his dual emphases on learning principles of action from the practices of one's life and on looking at the problems of living from outside of academic or theoretic philosophy. I'll have more to say about both topics in the near future.</p>

<h2><a href="1967.html">Utopia Is Not an Option</a></h2>
<h3>2025-06-02</h3>
<p>The recent death of philosopher Alisdair MacIntyre has prompted numerous assessments of his work (which, I'll admit, I have not looked at in decades - an oversight that I plan to remedy soon because of his status as perhaps the most prominent neo-Aristotelian thinker of the last fifty years). Several of the remembrances I've read expressed frustration with the lack of specificity in MacIntyre's political philosophy, which boils down to what my college professor Charles Larmore called "polis envy": the desire to construct communities on the model of the ancient Greek city-states, in which all the citizens worked together for the sake of a common purpose and a common vision of the good life. Only in such a setting, says MacIntyre, can human beings lead an ethically flourishing life.</p>
<p>This line of thinking strikes me as somewhat utopian, at least if people attempt to translate it into a consistent political program - as perhaps some of the "National Conservatives" have tried to do. Although years ago I went through a utopian or meta-utopian phase of my own, these days I'm not convinced. Yes, there is plenty to fix in our political, economic, and societal arrangements; even more significantly, as Thomas W. Smith points out in his book <cite>Revaluing Ethics</cite>, <em>every</em> society deforms the human person in one way or another so there is always room for improvement. Yet it seems to me that one can live an examined, ethically thriving life in any reasonably free society, because such a society provides sufficient affordances for work, love, family, friendship, community involvement, artistic creation, scientific research, lifelong learning, personal reflection, religious contemplation, philosophical speculation, and all the other worthy activities of life. We don't need a utopia to make that possible, which is a good thing because, as I like to say, utopia is not an option.</p>
<p>However, if people don't attempt to translate this line of thinking into a political program, then we'll end up with small intentional groupings along the lines of the ancient philosophical communities or the medieval monasteries (MacIntyre's book <cite>After Virtue</cite> ends with a call for a new St. Benedict). Indeed, inspired in some instances by MacIntyre, a number of such groups have formed over the last quarter century, loosely gathered under the heading of the New Monasticism. I plan to do also some reading on this topic in the coming months, with special attention to the potential for resurrecting at least some of the ancient spirit of philosophy as a way of life.</p>

<h2><a href="1966.html">Universe and Humanverse</a></h2>
<h3>2025-05-30</h3>
<p>As I have continued to read Spinoza's <cite>Ethics</cite> and at the same time apply Walter Kaufmann's suggestion to rethink every step critically, for a few days there I started to take notes toward a geometrical presentation of propositions I could agree with (e.g., instead beginning with a self-caused God who created the universe, my propositions began on more Aristotelian lines with being itself and an eternal universe).</p>
<p>Even though this might have been a worthwhile exercise (and I might revisit it sometime), doubts crept in. Is the fundamental nature of the universe really the right place to start in constructing a philosophy of life? Channeling thinkers as diverse as Socrates, Lao Tzu, Lin Yutang, Pierre Hadot, and Robert Sokolowski, I had a flash of insight: the ground truth to build from is not the universe as a whole but the "humanverse" in which we find ourselves. By this I mean specifically that <em>you and I are both human beings who possess λόγος and therefore can engage in a conversation about truth, beauty, meaning, and how to live</em>.</p>
<p>This conversation is not only philosophical: as I sketched out in my manifesto on philokalia earlier this year, it is also musical, poetical, artistic, and aesthetic in the widest sense of the word. (Or, to put it another way, philosophy is not only linguistic, dialectical, and theoretical.)</p>
<p>In Plato's <cite>Phaedrus</cite>, Socrates worried about the impact of the written word on human interaction because you can't have a conversation with a book. Machiavelli and Nietzsche (among others) might have disagreed, because in their own minds and in their practice of writing they carried on a kind of conversation with ancient friends such as Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, and Plutarch.</p>
<p>Naturally, ancient friends are no substitute for living friends, which is why philosophy, music, poetry, arts, sciences, crafts, and so many other pursuits are best done in collaboration and communication with people who can help you learn, grow, and flourish.</p>
<p>As to the propositions and commitments that flow from the ground truth of shared humanity, shared thought, and shared speech, I'll need to ponder that further and post again...</p>

<h2><a href="1965.html">Self-Deception</a></h2>
<h3>2025-05-26</h3>
<p>One of my personal aphorisms is: "The easiest thing in the world is self-deception."</p>
<p>Although self-deception is easy to fall into, it's not easy to understand. How is it that I can hide things from <em>myself</em>? At some level, mustn't I be aware of what I'm hiding? It's quite a puzzle!</p>
<p>Last year I read a fine book on the topic by philosopher Herbert Fingarette, who connects self-deception with an unwillingness to spell out what one is doing. His notion of spelling out is similar to the Aristotelian concept of ἀπόδειξις (typically rendered as "explanation") and connected to the Socratic insistence on giving an account for how one lives, as set out in Plato's dialogue <cite>Laches</cite>. Aristotle extended the Socratic insight with his formulation that one needs to act not only in accordance with reason (κατὰ λόγον) but in a way that is "suffused with reason" / "with an account" (μετὰ λόγου). All of these ideas could prove helpful in approaching the puzzle of self-deception.</p>
<p>As with wonder and so many other eakness of the will") to a more thoroughgoing corruption (μοχθηρία) of character, such as the sort of dissipation (ἀκολασία) in which one's settled policy is to pursue immediate pleasure no matter what the source. Aristotle seems to imply that self-indulgence can be triggered by an immediate impression (φαντασία) - to use a slightly old-fashioned example, an impression, say, that smoking cigarettes looks pretty cool. The person who once in a while succumbs to a weakness for smoking cigarettes hasn't yet sunk to the level of the chain smoker who over time has formed the false opinion that cigarettes are perfectly safe. Thus the question occurs to me: is it a consistent practice (ἔθος) of, say, smoking that solidifies deception (ἀπάτη) about its dangers and an avoidance of spelling out what one is doing and becoming?</p>
<p>At the end of his <cite>Posterior Analytics</cite>, Aristotle provides a beautiful metaphor about the growth of understanding in the mind: it is like a pitched battle in which one soldier and then another and another stand their ground so that eventually an incipient rout is turned into a solid phalanx of fighters. Reversing the metaphor, perhaps the growth of false opinion and self-deception is like a solid phalanx that disintegrates into a rout, where an escalating practice such as smoking more and more cigarettes each week eventually destroys (διαστρέφει) the order and integrity of one's soul.</p>
<p>Aristotle repeatedly emphasizes that greed for pleasure has a distorting effect on your perceptions, resulting in the stance that what merely <em>seems</em> good actually <em>is</em> good. Without an underlying limit grounded in a naturally good and beneficial activity, the pursuit of pleasure leads you astray and causes you to miss the target in life. The best preventive medicine against such foolishness consists in a deliberate commitment to succeeding as a human being, the cultivation of excellent character traits, a deep understanding of human fulfillment, and the kind of insights that only a love for wisdom can bring to life.</p>

<h2><a href="1964.html">Step by Step</a></h2>
<h3>2025-05-24</h3>
<p>Combining threads from recent posts on Spinoza and on Walter Kaufmann, here are a few further thoughts on intellectual honesty and philosophical methodology.</p>
<p>One of the most challenging aspects of reading Spinoza's <cite>Ethics</cite> is that he used the geometrical method, à la Euclid's <cite>Elements</cite>; the book is replete with axioms, definitions, propositions, proofs, corollaries, and scholia. Yet Spinoza scholar Edwin Curley once observed that the geometrical method is an exercise in intellectual honesty, because it helps prevent a thinker from hiding the assumptions and connections they make. Unfortunately, the result is an extemely dense text that is both eternally fascinating and eternally difficult!</p>
<p>On this point (albeit speaking about Hegel, not Spinoza), Kaufmann noted:</p>
<blockquote>When a philosopher is exceptionally difficult, most readers leave him alone or soon give up. The few who persevere and spend years figuring him out naturally do not like to be experts on something that is not worth while. So one is tempted to suspend criticism and concentrate on exegesis.</blockquote>
<p>Yet exegesis is not the be-all and end-all of philosophical study, because the point is to figure out what's true - and no one has a monopoly on <em>that</em> (as Tocqueville said: "men grasp fragments of truth, but never truth itself"). Kaufmann argues that we need to combine fair-minded comprehension with critical evaluation:</p>
<blockquote>External criticism that simply condemns without any prior effort to comprehend is relatively easy and trivial. To really grasp a position and the arguments involved in it is more difficult. But a philosopher must combine grasp and critical evaluation; for until we rethink every step critically we cannot fully comprehend what led a writer to go on as he did; what problems led him to develop his views; and what prompted later writers to differ with him.</blockquote>
<p>Ideally, the step-by-step reasoning process set forth in a serious treatise like Spinoza's <cite>Ethics</cite> should enable us to form solid conclusions about the author's arguments - if only we can muster the patience to "rethink every step critically"...</p>
