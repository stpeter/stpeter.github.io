<h2><a href="1965.html">The Road to Self-Deception</a></h2>
<h3>2025-05-26</h3>
<p>One of my personal aphorisms is: "The easiest thing in the world is self-deception."</p>
<p>Although self-deception is easy to fall into, it's not easy to understand. How is it that I can hide things from <em>myself</em>? At some level, mustn't I be aware of what I'm hiding?</p>
<p>Last year I read a fine book on the topic by philosopher Herbert Fingarette, who connects self-deception with an unwillingness to spell out what one is doing. His notion of spelling out is similar to the Aristotelian concept of ἀπόδειξις (typically rendered as "explanation") and connected to the Socratic insistence on giving an account for how one lives, as set out in Plato's dialogue Laches. Aristotle extended the Socratic insight with his formulation that one needs to act not only in accordance with reason (κατὰ λόγον) but in a way that is "suffused with reason" / "with an account" (μετὰ λόγου). All of these ideas could prove helpful in approaching the puzzle of self-deception.</p>
<p>As with wonder and so many other phenomena, I suspect that several interconnected factors are at play here. One line of thought I've been pursuing is the progression from occasional self-indulgence (ἀκρασία or "weakness of the will") to a more thoroughgoing corruption (μοχθηρία) of character, such as the sort of dissipation (ἀκολασία) in which one's settled policy is to pursue immediate pleasure no matter what the source. Aristotle seems to imply that self-indulgence can be triggered by an immediate impression (φαντασία) - to use a slightly old-fashioned example, an impression, say, that smoking cigarettes looks pretty cool. The person who once in a while succumbs to a weakness for smoking cigarettes hasn't yet sunk to the level of the chain smoker who over time has formed the false opinion that cigarettes are perfectly safe. Thus the question occurs to me: is it a consistent practice (ἔθος) of, say, smoking that solidifies deception (ἀπάτη) about its dangers and an avoidance of spelling out what one is doing and becoming?</p>
<p>At the end of his <cite>Posterior Analytics</cite>, Aristotle provides a beautiful metaphor about the growth of understanding in the mind: it is like a pitched battle in which one soldier and then another and another stand their ground so that eventually an incipient rout is turned into a solid phalanx of fighters. Reversing the metaphor, perhaps the growth of false opinion and self-deception is like a solid phalanx that disintegrates into a rout, where an escalating practice such as smoking more and more cigarettes each week eventually destroys (διαστρέφει) the order and integrity of one's soul.</p>
<p>Aristotle repeatedly emphasizes that greed for pleasure has a distorting effect on your perceptions, resulting in the stance that what merely <em>seems</em> good actually <em>is</em> good. Without an underlying limit grounded in a naturally good and beneficial activity, the pursuit of pleasure leads you astray and causes you to miss the target in life. The best preventive medicine against such foolishness consists in a deliberate commitment to succeeding as a human being, the cultivation of excellent character traits, a deep understanding of human fulfillment, and the kind of insights that only a love for wisdom can bring to life.</p>

<h2><a href="1964.html">Step by Step</a></h2>
<h3>2025-05-24</h3>
<p>Combining threads from recent posts on Spinoza and on Walter Kaufmann, here are a few further thoughts on intellectual honesty and philosophical methodology.</p>
<p>One of the most challenging aspects of reading Spinoza's <cite>Ethics</cite> is that he used the geometrical method, à la Euclid's <cite>Elements</cite>; the book is replete with axioms, definitions, propositions, proofs, corollaries, and scholia. Yet Spinoza scholar Edwin Curley once observed that the geometrical method is an exercise in intellectual honesty, because it helps prevent a thinker from hiding the assumptions and connections they make. Unfortunately, the result is an extemely dense text that is both eternally fascinating and eternally difficult!</p>
<p>On this point (albeit speaking about Hegel, not Spinoza), Kaufmann noted:</p>
<blockquote>When a philosopher is exceptionally difficult, most readers leave him alone or soon give up. The few who persevere and spend years figuring him out naturally do not like to be experts on something that is not worth while. So one is tempted to suspend criticism and concentrate on exegesis.</blockquote>
<p>Yet exegesis is not the be-all and end-all of philosophical study, because the point is to figure out what's true - and no one has a monopoly on <em>that</em> (as Tocqueville said: "men grasp fragments of truth, but never truth itself"). Kaufmann argues that we need to combine fair-minded comprehension with critical evaluation:</p>
<blockquote>External criticism that simply condemns without any prior effort to comprehend is relatively easy and trivial. To really grasp a position and the arguments involved in it is more difficult. But a philosopher must combine grasp and critical evaluation; for until we rethink every step critically we cannot fully comprehend what led a writer to go on as he did; what problems led him to develop his views; and what prompted later writers to differ with him.</blockquote>
<p>Ideally, the step-by-step reasoning process set forth in a serious treatise like Spinoza's <cite>Ethics</cite> should enable us to form solid conclusions about the author's arguments - if only we can muster the patience to "rethink every step critically"...</p>

<h2><a href="1963.html">Whence Wonder?</a></h2>
<h3>2025-05-23</h3>
<p>Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle held that philosophy - the love and practice of wisdom - begins in wonder. But whence wonder?</p>
<p>At the beginning of his <cite>Metaphysics</cite> (982b12 ff.), Aristotle observes that in the lead-up to philosophy people wondered first about "the strange things near at hand" and then about celestial phenomena like the moon, the stars, and the origin of the universe. What were these "strange things" that people found so fascinating and astonishing?</p>
<p>One prominent example might have been the ambiguous, confusing nature of human beings. Consider the wonder or amazement (θαύμα) with which we can be struck speechless or reduced to babbling (ψελλίζω) when we weigh (ὑπολαμβάνω) the overlapping nature (ἐπάλλαξις) of human beings, wavering or teetering (ἐπαμφοτερίζω) as we do between independent and herdlike, competitive and cooperative, deceptive and truthful, ignorant and insightful, cunning and just, foolish and wise, beastly and godlike.</p>
<p>There's a cluster of concepts here that might not be immediately obvious. To unravel things we can start by pulling on any one of the threads, so let's look at ἐπάλλαξις, which is a certain overlapping or intermixture of characteristics. If we think of Aristotle as a strict taxonomist like Linnaeus, we'd be wrong. In his biological works, Aristotle identified numerous animals that have overlapping characteristics and thus "waver" or "teeter" or "dualize" (ἐπαμφοτερίζω) between natural kinds: seals dualize between water animals and land animals, hermit crabs between crustaceans and testaceans, sea anemones between plants and animals, apes and monkeys and baboons between humans and quadrupeds, etc. Similarly, although Aristotle famously said that human beings are political animals, we are also "social solitaries" who tend toward both ends of the continuum from independent to herdlike (<cite>Historia Animalium</cite>, 487b33 ff).</p>
<p>Ambiguities like these can reduce one to babbling (ψελλίζω): if someone asks you whether seal are land animals <em>or</em> water animals - or whether humans are, say, competitive <em>or</em> cooperative - you might not be able to say. Moreover, in his <cite>Magna Moralia</cite> (1197a31), Aristotle says that ὑπόληψις (the noun derived from ὑπολαμβάνω, in the sense of taking something up for consideration, entertaining a notion, or weighing alternative accounts) is that whereby we "waver" or "teeter" (ἐπαμφοτερίζω) between thinking that something is one way or another.</p>
<p>Yet Aristotle was anything but an epistemological defeatist: "the strange things near at hand" inspire us to wonder and then to inquiry, thought, and dialogue. Indeed, the longer I live and the more deeply I reflect, the more I wonder about the sorts of overlapping, dualizing phenomena that seem to be characteristic not only of human affairs but also of physics (light is both a particle and a wave), biology (are viruses alive or not?), history (in which there's never just one cause), and so on. There are endless sources of wonder in life, if only we can attune ourselves to them!</p>

<h2><a href="1962.html">Reading Spinoza</a></h2>
<h3>2025-05-22</h3>
<p>Over the last few weeks I've been re-reading Spinoza's <cite>Ethics</cite> yet again, this time inspired by a review of Kieran Fox's newly-published spiritual biography of Einstein, which noted that when pressed about his religious beliefs the great scientist claimed to believe in Spinoza's God.</p>
<p>Even though I took a graduate-level course on Spinoza back in college and have read the <cite>Ethics</cite> several times, I must confess that I find the nature of Spinoza's God to be rather opaque. However, I'm not alone in this regard, because apparently it's a matter of some scholarly contention. Clare Carlisle's recent book <cite>Spinoza's Religion</cite> might clarify matters, but I haven't read it yet.</p>
<p>My professor at Columbia repeatedly enjoined us to "don our Spinozistic glasses" when attempting to understand Spinoza's ideas, but I'm finding it helpful to don a wide variety of glasses: Platonic, Aristotelian, Taoist, Hindu, Buddhist, even Randian! Following Hannah Arendt's suggestion that "the god of the philosophers" is being itself, as I'm reading I will sometimes test Spinoza's statements about God by substituting terms like Being, What-Is, Existence, the All, the One, the Infinite, Brahman, and Tao. Some of these work at times, but not at others; for instance, although Spinoza talks about "the mind of God", I can't make sense of phrases like "the mind of Existence" or "the mind of Tao".</p>
<p>Given my immersion in Aristotle and Greek philosophy more generally, substitutions for other terms can ease the path to understanding, at least for me. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>"substance" is an English rendering of Latin "substantia", which in turn was a translation of the Greek word οὐσία meaning "thinghood" or "entity" (this last term seem to map most closely to Spinoza's "substance")</li>
<li>"essence" is an English rendering of Latin "essentia", which in turn was a translation of the cumbersome Aristotelian phrase τό τί ἦν εἶναι or "what it is to be a thing"</li>
<li>for "attribute" I've been substituting "way of being" (my preferred rendering of Greek εἶδος)</li>
<li>for "mode" I've been substituting "instantiation"</li>
<li>for "accident" I've been substituting "aspect"</li>
</ul>
<p>These substitutions aren't always workable, and I suppose they might take me further from Spinoza's intended meanings, but as Aristotle said we often need to start from what is more familiar to us, especially when the intellectual road is rough and full of impasses.</p>

<h2><a href="1961.html">Freedom of Screech</a></h2>
<h3>2025-05-13</h3>
<p>My alma mater, Columbia University, was back in the news yet again last week because some screeching students took over parts of Butler Library while serious students were preparing for final exams. The details are unimportant in this context; instead I'm puzzled by what passes for speech these days.</p>
<p>In ancient Greek, the word λόγος means, at root, both thought and speech: it is simultaneously the thinking that reveals itself in speech and the speaking that reveals what a person is thinking. Mindlessly chanting slogans with one's fellow "activists" barely counts as speech, if you ask me, because there is barely any thought behind it - to mention a few more meanings of λόγος, those who merely screech offer no reasoned account of their ideas and are not seeking a conversation in pursuit of truth. Comparatively speaking, the anti-war protesters who engaged in sit-ins at Columbia 60+ years ago were paragons of intellectualism, for many of them held teach-ins and earnestly sought to persuade others of their point of view.</p>
<p>Freedom of speech is enshrined in the First Amendment for many good reasons, but I am far less impressed by freedom of screech, especially since it is typically accompanied by physical intimidation that goes well beyond peaceful association with likeminded others.</p>

<h2><a href="1960.html">Intellectual Honesty</a></h2>
<h3>2025-05-08</h3>
<p>In his book <cite>The Faith of a Heretic</cite>, Walter Kaufmann spells out an ethic of intellectual honesty. (The book covers many other topics, but that's the core of it.) He sets admirably high standards for himself and anyone else who would, in the words of his fellow philosopher Jan Patočka, live in truth. As Kaufmann presents it, intellectual honesty is a challenging virtue because we're all liable to limit ourselves to the comfortable confines of what we already know - or think we know.</p>
<p>Here are some of the particular practices suggested by Kaufmann that I found especially significant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a keen intellectual conscience, i.e., make your beliefs, opinions, statements, and philosophical commitments a matter of conscience. Specific qualities here include being imaginative, careful, and scrupulous.</li>
<li>Don't fear disagreement. Indeed, "fear of disagreement is for a philosopher what fear of getting hurt is for a soldier - cowardice." Shun facile agreement, seek out disagreement, and explore plausible alternatives to your own long-held views.</li>
<li>Avoid self-deception. Because (as I like to say) self-deception is the easiest thing in the world, avoiding it can be quite difficult and involves, among other things, trying to see your own faults - perhaps with a little help from your friends or your intellectual opponents.</li>
<li>Don't think in labels or assume that label-like concepts ("good", "evil", etc.) have one central meaning that everyone agrees on. The most important concepts are fundamentally contested.</li>
<li>Raise your standards and demand more of yourself. Most people are honest, but (according to Kaufmann) minimally so because they don't want to rock the boat. The deeply honest person should seek out other perspectives, criticize their own positions, remain open to objections, and retain only what stands up in the face of thoroughgoing examination.</li>
<li>Don't begin with your own viewpoint and then repudiate whatever conflicts with it; instead, repeatedly encounter other viewpoints in a spirit of dialogue, opening yourself to objections, concerns, alternatives, modifications, replies, and refutations.</li>
<li>Get specific. For instance, when weighing the place of a particular character trait in your own personal ethic, reflect on the ramifications of abandoning it altogether, consider what can be said against it, imagine what society would be like without it, etc.</li>
<li>Don't be noncommittal. Take a stand, stick your neck out, and engage in what John Herman Randall (in his book on Aristotle) called "the passionate search for passionless truth."</li>
</ul>
<p>Although these principles are admirable, it's hard to put them into practice!</p>
