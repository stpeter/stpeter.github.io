<h2><a href="1940.html">Writing as Thinking</a></h2>
<h3>2025-03-03</h3>
<p>Why write? I can't speak for anyone else, but for me writing is a form of thinking. Although I often have vague notions floating around in my head, they don't crystallize until I formulate them in black and white. Before words can inform, they must be formed.</p>
<p>The best examples from my own practice are the short books I write to set down my encounters with great thinkers like Nietzsche, Thoreau, and now Aristotle. For instance, as I've worked through Aristotle's philosophy over the last five years I've probably read 50,000 pages by and about him - his complete works, the dialogues of Plato, and countless books and papers from the scholarly literature. Yet that was just the beginning, since the reading itself has been followed by copying thousands of marked-up passages into the digital equivalent of an old-fashioned commonplace book (still in progress), noticing connections among these passages, making integrations across Aristotle's works from metaphysics to biology to ethics to aesthetics, consulting the original Greek texts, figuring out my preferred (often novel) renderings for key philosophical terms, posing questions to myself, spelling out my provisional conclusions about those questions either in private notes or public blog posts, comparing Aristotle's views with those of more modern thinkers, identifying situations in my own life where I can apply what I've learned, and in general pondering the meaning of it all. And that's all before putting pen to paper in a definitive manner!</p>
<p>Indeed, I realized recently (upon reading a post on writing by my friend Betsy Mikel) that I'm not necessarily even wedded to writing a book about Aristotle's conception of human fulfillment - except it's only by doing so that I'll actually understand what he said and how I can put his insights to work in my own efforts to do a better job at living.</p>
<p>This sketch of my writing/thinking process illustrates my I'm so skeptical about prompting "artificial intelligence" software for "the answers" to the most enduring perplexities of human existence. As Hannah Arendt described years ago in her magisterial book <cite>The Life of the Mind</cite>, the purpose of this kind of deep thinking (as opposed to problem-solving, goal-oriented cognition) isn't to obtain "the answers" at all. Instead, deep thinking is an end in itself. Aristotle put it by saying that human fulfillment extends as far as awareness [theoria] does, but the idea was more memorably captured by Socrates when he declared in his courtroom defense that the unthinking life is not worth living for a human being.</p>

<h2><a href="1939.html">The Joy of Creation</a></h2>
<h3>2025-03-02</h3>
<p>Several times now I've been exposed to "poems" generated by LLMs, whether sent to me by friends or posted by bloggers. Leaving aside their questionable quality, I would never use LLMs in this way. To me, the joy of creation lies not in the artifact but in the artistry. Would you prompt an LLM-equipped robot to attend a concert or sporting event on your behalf, take a walk with your child, or meet your best friend for lunch? I shudder to think that people might do such things before long. Similarly, writing poems, composing music, making pottery, and the like are not instances of drudgery but creative acts emblematic of the life of a free person.</p>
<p>For tasks in which efficiency, productivity, impressing your boss, and getting the right answer are paramount, I sort of understand the appeal of LLMs. Thankfully, now that I'm out of the workforce I no longer need to do such things. Instead, I have the freedom to think and play and create in the realms of music, poetry, and philosophy to my heart's content at my own pace. Because I find these activities perfectly delightful on their own, I'd find it intrusive and degrading to interact with an LLM while engaging in them.</p>
<p>It's becoming increasingly evident that our human world is being invaded by "artificial intelligence" (I always use scare quotes because the term begs many questions). People who are dear to me use LLMs every day to complete the banausic tasks their work requires, and I don't judge them for it. But each of us must be intentional and deliberate about whether and where we will use this new technology. For me, I draw the line at autotelic activities that are and of right ought to be ends in themselves.</p>

<h2><a href="1938.html">In Medias Res</a></h2>
<h3>2025-03-02</h3>
<p>(This post introduces my new Substack newsletter, <a href="https://beautifulwisdom.substack.com/">Beautiful Wisdom</a>.)</p>
<p>Well, here we are in the middle of things. I mean that in several senses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Personally, I've been writing, publishing, and blogging for 25+ years. Posting at Substack is a continuation and evolution of that long-running activity, not something fundamentally new for me.</li>
<li>Historically, culturally, and technologically, it appears that we're in the thick of massive changes. Yet appearances can be deceiving, and I plan to bring the insights of history and philosophy (as well as my quarter century in the software industry) to bear on understanding where we've been, where we are, and where we're going.</li>
<li>Politically, the pendulum seems to be swinging wildly from left to right. Although I prefer to steer clear of political topics, occasionally I'll be speaking from the middle in favor of moderation, brotherhood, and being reasonable - all the while doing what I can to live up to the American ideals of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</li>
<li>Philosophically, my perspective is broadly consistent with the classical and especially Aristotelian focus on practical wisdom, human fulfillment, a noble way of life, and doing justice to the complexities of our common experience by finding a middle way between extremes.</li>
</ol>
<p>As to the title of this venue - Beautiful Wisdom - it represents my commitment to appreciating the enduring and evanescent beauty of the world we live in, bringing something beautiful into existence by composing poetry and music, and treating people as beautifully as I can in my all-too-brief span on this earth.</p>
<p>Onward and upward!</p>

<h2><a href="1937.html">A Poem a Day Keeps the Doldrums Away</a></h2>
<h3>2025-02-25</h3>
<p>To keep my sanity and experience more beauty in life, I endeavor to read a few poems every day. To facilitate this practice among other people, I've decided to start a Substack newsletter with a simple mission: publish one classic poem a day from the vast store of English-language verse in the public domain that I've already uploaded to the Monadnock Valley Press website. Check it out at the link below.</p>

<h2><a href="1936.html">Inwardly Free</a></h2>
<h3>2025-02-09</h3>
<p>A while back I learned of a poet and historian named Peter Viereck (1916-2006), who not only won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1949 but also wrote insightful books of social and literary criticism in the American individualist tradition of Emerson, Thoreau, and Randolph Bourne. In his now-forgotten book <cite>The Unadjusted Man</cite>, published in 1956, Viereck celebrated the kind of person who dodges the pressures of conformity (what he called "overadjustment") to maintain a measure of intellectual independence. Here is a fine passage about one path to becoming an "unadjusted man":</p>
<blockquote>To remain an individual in an overadjusted society, start out, first of all, by being an amateur at everything, never a professional. This is true whether you are a poet, scholar, or political leader, whether you are an artist of life, love, or billiards. According to Mark Twain, to play billiards moderately well is the sign of a gentleman; to play it too well is the sign of a mis-spent life. In an age of boorish, narrow specialists and of efficient experts who do everything "too well" in unimaginative, slavish stereotypes, in such an age only the amateur stays inwardly free. An amateurish life is a life of harmonious proportion because it alone finds time to cultivate the complete human being, public and private, cerebral and emotional. A free society requires not only free ideals, free institutions, but free personalities. The free personality is an "amateur" in both senses: (1) he who does things for love, not utility; (2) the non-technician, not yet deprived of creative imagination by expertise.</blockquote> 
<p>Although Viereck paints with too broad a brush - to take but one example, pianist Glenn Gould was both a consummate professional and a consummate individualist - his central point about being "inwardly free" is worthy of serious consideration. At root this is a matter not necessarily of professional status but of <em>attitude</em>. I'll grant that the attitude - similar, perhaps, to the "beginner's mind" that Buddhists try to manifest - might be easier to keep if one doesn't feel a need to achieve the status, yet it does seem like something that even non-amateurs could cultivate...</p>

<h2><a href="1935.html">Moving Slow</a></h2>
<h3>2025-02-08</h3>
<p>Several factors have conspired recently to slow down my pace of posting. Not only have I been working through a difficult and distracting family matter, but I've been questioning some of my existing commitments. Among other things, I've decided to conclude my philosophical coaching and startup advising activities. Although these were intriguing experiments and I enjoyed working with several people, I have my doubts about how truly helpful I was; more generally, I doubt that I am cut out for the helping professions. As a result, I'll be shutting down my philosopher.coach website and in the future posting only at stpeter.im (however, I won't rule out a move to Substack, at least for some of my mid-length writings).</p>
<p>Progress on my Aristotle book continues, but that has slackened, too. Because my powers of attention have been weak and scattered, all I've been doing of late is mindlessly typing passages from Aristotle's works into my searchable collection of book and article summaries. This will set me up for success six or twelve months from now when I expect to start writing in earnest, but it's not an inherently fulfilling task. C'est la vie.</p>
<p>On the plus side, to stay calm during this somewhat stressful time I've been engaging in my favorite form of meditation: playing guitar. I've been learning the <em>Trois Gymnopédies</em> of Erik Satie as arranged for classical guitar and, even better, I'm composing a short piece inspired by Satie (which I'm calling <em>Gymnosophie #1</em> in honor of the "naked wise men", likely early Buddhists, that Pyrrho and Alexander the Great visited in northwestern India 2300+ years ago). This piece started out as a simple essay in the Dorian mode but is gradually morphing into an exploration of harmonic ambiguity à la Fauré and Satie, with travels to distant keys and an eventual return to the home key of D. I'm not yet sure if it will come together successfully, but I've been enjoying the unhurried musical journey.</p>
