<h2><a href="1809.html">The Death of Democracy?</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-13</h3>
<p>Is democracy in peril? Apparently many pundits think so. Yet 'democracy' is notoriously difficult to define. Although I strive to stay away from political topics in this journal, perhaps by applying some philosophical elbow grease we can lessen our worries about yet another emergency disaster crisis.</p>
<p>The ancient Greeks understood δημοκρατία to mean that power was held and exercised by the people. The Athenian democracy, which is the ancient one we know best, included all sorts of clever hacks to ensure that the people (well, propertied male citizens) would be involved in ruling; these included a massive assembly and random selection of citizens to higher office. The Athenians distinguished these democratic principles from oligarchy (rule by the few - typically the rich) and monarchy (rule by one person - either a hereditary king or a non-hereditary "tyrant").</p>
<p>The Athenians would not agree with us that elections are the hallmark of democracy. Indeed, they suspected that choosing government officers through elections instead of random selection would lead to an oligarchy because only the rich would end up serving. We have living proof of their fears today, since with a few exceptions our current system of government is oligarchic, not democratic.</p>
<p>Aside from jury service, one of those exceptions is small-town government, especially in New England. As I mentioned over twenty years ago in this journal, no less a political philosopher than Thomas Jefferson held that we should "divide the counties into wards" (i.e., townships) so that the people could govern themselves. In his letter to Samuel Kerchival of July 12, 1816, Jefferson called for "making every citizen an acting member of the government" through the following means:</p>
<blockquote>Divide the counties into wards of such size as that every citizen can attend when called on, and act in person. Ascribe to them the government of their wards in all things relating to themselves exclusively.... These wards, called townships in New England, are the vital principle of their governments, and have proved themselves the wisest invention ever devised by the wit of man for the perfect exercise of self-government, and for its preservation.</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, even in New England the tradition of the town meeting has atrophied somewhat, as Frank Bryan describes in his book <cite>Real Democracy</cite>. Part of the challenge can be attributed to our old friend, Dunbar's numbers. Robin Dunbar has shown that most people are truly acquainted with only 500 people, know only 1,500 people by name, and know only 5,000 people by sight. The town I grew up in (Readfield, Maine) had about 2,000 people when I lived there, and the town meeting seemed to function fairly well if I recall correctly. But if a town grows to 5,000 or 10,000 people, it's unlikely that self-governance can be sustained. To handle population growth (America had 4 million people in 1790 but has 330+ million today), perhaps Jefferson would have said "divide the towns into neighborhoods!"</p>
<p>In any case, it strikes me that if democracy in America is dying, it has been a slow, steady process as the population has grown, as power has been increasingly centralized in the managerial state at the national level, as fewer people have direct experience of self-government in their own town or neighborhood, and so on. Paradoxically, perhaps, I am less concerned about a sudden collapse of representative "democracy" and more concerned about the seemingly inexorable decline of self-government.</p>

<h2><a href="1808.html">Daily Reflection</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-09</h3>
<p>As a counterpart to my morning practice of daily forethought, I've also been engaging in daily reflection every evening. This habit was made famous by the ancient Stoic Seneca in Book III of his dialogue <cite>On Anger</cite>, where he mentions that his teacher Sextius asked himself these three probing questions before going to sleep: "What bad habit of yours have you cured today? What vice have you checked? In what respect are you better?" Some of my questions are more positive, but still geared toward living a more examined life:</p>
<ul>
<li>What went well today? Why? What should I keep doing?</li>
<li>What didn't go well today? Why not? What should I stop doing?</li>
<li>Were there situations today in which I didn't act in accordance with my best self? How will I do better next time?</li>
<li>What progress did I make today regarding my relationships, projects, character, health, knowledge, and wisdom?</li>
<li>Did I have any positive experiences today that are worth savoring?</li>
</ul>
<p>The key themes I try to bring out are awareness of how I'm conducting myself and interacting with other people, objectivity about my strengths and weaknesses, honest understanding and analysis of my behavior, reinforcement of what I'm doing right, correction of what I'm doing wrong, and commitment to my chosen principles and policies in life.</p>
<p>And as I begin the day with a kind of benediction, so I've been experimenting with something similar at the end of the day: "Thankful am I for having enjoyed another day on this beautiful earth. May it be said that I made the most of it. I have lived, and lived well."</p>
<p>This last sentence is a paraphrase of a suggestion that Seneca makes in his twelfth letter to Lucilius: "Let us go to our sleep with joy and gladness; let us say: I have lived." Yet I affix an Aristotelian coda, which is that more important than living is <em>living well</em>.</p>

<h2><a href="1807.html">Daily Forethought</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-07</h3>
<p>In pursuit of a more examined life, I've been honing my daily habits. Taking a hint from the ancient Stoics, first thing in the morning I've been thinking about the day ahead and then at the end of the day I've been reflecting on how the day went. Here's a snapshot of what this looks like for me (I'll split this up into two posts, one prospective and one retrospective).</p>
<p>To begin the day, I apply an Epicurean twist and take a moment to appreciate the simple fact of being alive to enjoy another day of existence. This includes being grateful for some of the many beautiful and beneficial aspects of the life I lead. Then I ask myself a series of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are my most important activities today? How will I make them positive, productive and meaningful?</li>
<li>Which relationships will I nurture today?</li>
<li>Which long-term projects will I move forward today?</li>
<li>Which practices will I focus on today to strengthen my character?</li>
<li>What will I do today for the sake of my health?</li>
<li>What will I do today to appreciate the beauty of the world around me?</li>
<li>What opportunities for learning will I have today?</li>
<li>What setbacks might I face today and how will I prepare for them?</li>
<li>What positive experiences will I create today for myself and the people I care about?</li>
</ul>
<p>To make this session as successful as possible, I try to keep the following themes in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Raising my <em>awareness</em> throughout the day.</li>
<li>Approaching the day with a greater sense of <em>purpose</em>.</li>
<li>Having more <em>optimism</em> about what I can accomplish.</li>
<li>Facing challenges with greater <em>resilience</em>.</li>
<li>Maintaining a high level of <em>focus</em>.</li>
<li>Putting a premium on effective <em>action</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I keep a notes document on my phone to remind me of these questions and themes, which I look at before I peek at ephemera like email, news headlines, or the weather forecast. As Thoreau said, "Read not the Times; Read the Eternities." And what's more eternal than living a good life?</p>

<h2><a href="1806.html">Tao Te Ching §11: Emptiness</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-03</h3>
<p>Following up on yesterday's post about the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite>, here's another poem that I might set to music (chapter 11 in the standard order). My provisional rendering is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
Some thirty spokes meet in one hub<br>
Through emptiness it does its work<br>
Throw clay and shape it to a jar<br>
Through emptiness it does its work<br>
Cut doors and windows, make a room<br>
Through emptiness it does its work
<br><br>
The craftsman profits from its mass<br>
And yet it works through emptiness
</blockquote>
<p>At only 8 lines, it would make for an extremely short song. But that might be the nature of this project!</p>
<p>In this poem we glimpse the paradoxical side of Taoism. To my mind it suggests an aesthetic appreciation for subtlety, silence, simplicity, austere beauty, and what must be left unsaid - the space between the notes, if you will. Indeed, this poem raises the possibility that the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite> itself might do its work through emptiness, for if the philosophical is the personal then (as chapter 1 puts it) "the way that we can say is not the ageless Way" and "the name that we can name is not the ageless Name".</p>
<p>But how could this be? Isn't the ageless something abstract and far away? Perhaps; but perhaps instead it's something tangible and near: the abiding ways of living that human beings have engaged in for as long as we have been on this beautiful earth of ours.</p>

<h2><a href="1805.html">Tao Te Ching §1: The Gateway</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-02</h3>
<p>For many years I have admired, and puzzled over, the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite>. This classic text of Chinese philosophy is wise, poetic, suggestive, paradoxial, even inscrutable. Because I don't know classical Chinese, I'm forced to read multiple translations - a task made easy by the fact that it's one of the most translated works in all of world literature. Yet, not knowing the original language, I'm always unsure whether I really understand its message. It's one of my "best friend books" and I return to it every few years.</p>
<p>Each of the 81 chapters of the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite> consists of a short poem. Recently I've formed the ambition of setting some of these poems to music. The inspiration for this somewhat unusual project is the Beatles song "The Inner Light", in which George Harrison used a translation of chapter 47 of the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite> (with slight adjustments) as his text.</p>
<p>The first step for each song is to settle on the lyrics. Somewhat boldly, I've decided to make my own renderings by triangulating among available translations. Here, for instance, is my version of chapter 1, which I've entitled "The Gateway"...</p>
<blockquote>
The way that we can say is not the ageless Way<br>
The name that we can name is not the ageless Name<br>
From that which has no name, came Heaven and came Earth<br>
From that which we can name, all things have had their birth
<br><br>
Never yearning, we see the way things are<br>
Ever yearning, we see but what appears<br>
Born together, these differ but in name<br>
See their oneness, a mystery indeed
<br><br>
The mystery of mysteries<br>
The gateway to all wonder
</blockquote>
<p>We see here some of the signature themes of Taoism: the presence of an ageless Way underlying all heaven and earth; the gap between our names for things and their true natures; the urgent need to let go of yearnings and cravings so that we can live in harmony with the Way; the improbable unity of the abstract or universal and the particular or personal; and what Socrates too recognized as the origins of philosophy in the experience of wonder.</p>
<p>As to the resulting song, I'll endeavor to make a rough recording in the near future.</p>

<h2><a href="1804.html">The Republic of Letters</a></h2>
<h3>2023-07-31</h3>
<p>About 600 years ago, some farsighted intellectual explorers in Europe created a long-distance communication network they called the Republic of Letters; indeed, it was almost something like a network of networks (an internet!), since it connected local networks in various towns and cities with each other. The way it worked is that individual people would exchange handwritten letters and manuscripts, and eventually printed pamphlets and books, with correspondents in other parts of the network. Those correspondents would then write back to the original sender and also share insights with others to whom they were connected (whether local or distant). It was also expected that participants would help to grow the network by recruiting new members. This network, which flourished from about 1400 to 1800, played a significant role in fostering the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the early Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the Republic of Letters was the individual and collective advancement of knowledge, both theoretical and practical. Toward that end, the participants committed themselves to certain core principles, which we could describe as follows: reflection, not reaction; reason, not emotion; respect, not contempt; conversation, not argument; learning, not partisanship; and upholding the highest standards of clarity in writing (mostly in Latin because that was the universal language of Europe back then).</p>
<p>Now consider how far the Republic of Letters is from our current modes of interaction over the Internet, especially in so-called social media apps. Unlike those pioneers of knowledge who were supremely dedicated to building a better world, we now inhabit a living hell of emotivistic reaction, mutual contempt, and partisan vitriol, too often expressed in expletives and insults. And don't get me started on our seemingly inexorable slide into a post-literate society.</p>
<p>Is there hope? Perhaps. We still have people who write intelligent essays, blogs, newsletters, papers, and books. Twitter (X?) and its ilk are a mess, but there's always the possibility that someone will create a communication app designed to lift participants up to a higher standard rather than pull them down to the lowest common denominator. If I were building such an app, I might consider the following features: words only, no images or videos; something like a 200-word minimum on posts; a 24-hour delay in posting so that people don't write with undue heat; posts only, no comments; no like button; no repost button; no sponsored posts; no centrally-controlled algorithms for the primary interface; relatively small conversation groups (say, 15 people), consistent with Robin Dunbar's insights into human interaction; and perhaps even smaller, 5-person learning teams focused on solving particular problems or intensively exploring particular topics.</p>
<p>Even if someone doesn't offer such an app, we can behave as if they had by avoiding the social media sewer and committing ourselves to moderation and reasonableness when interacting with our fellow citizens of the intellectual republic. It's worth a try, anyway!</p>
