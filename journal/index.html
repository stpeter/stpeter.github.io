<h2><a href="1875.html">Walking with Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics III.6-9</a></h2>
<h3>2024-06-21</h3>
<p>The first thriving of character that Aristotle discusses at length is courage. Why?</p>
<p>To start with, we mustn't forget the cultural and historical context: that of small city-states plagued by endemic warfare (e.g., Athens and Megara, 40km apart, were in conflict on and off for centuries). For good reason, the Greek word ἀνδρεία means both courage and manliness: if the menfolk did not demonstrate bravery in battle, a town could be destroyed, with the men likely killed and the women and children sold into slavery. For the ancients, courage was serious business.</p>
<p>More fundamentally, courage illustrates a number key points that Aristotle wishes to make about human character:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Because it is possible not only to fall short of "hitting the target" in human behavior but also to overshoot it, an excellence of character has not one opposite, but two. For instance, courage is opposed not only to cowardice but also to rashness.</li>
  <li>Human beings thrive not only in their actions but also in their feelings and emotions. For instance, true courage isn't merely a matter of acting bravely but also of experiencing the right amounts of fear and confidence in threatening situations. Indeed, the courageous person faces even the risk of a noble death with a feeling of tranquility, at least within human limits (there are certain dangers that no one should be expected to face without disturbance).</li>
  <li>Behaviors come with reasons and thoughts and accounts attached, and those matter. For instance, it's not true courage if you appear to act bravely merely because you want to avoid a court-martial, or because you're forced to do so, or because you're so experienced that nothing fazes you, or because you're naturally high-spirited, or because you have unrealistic levels of self-confidence, or because you're totally oblivious to the dangers you face.</li>
  <li>The correct reason or thought or account (ὀρθός λόγος) for an action-plus-feeling is that it is the beautifully right (καλός) thing to do, or that not to do it would be repulsively wrong (αἰσχρός). Yes, these phrases are charged with ethical and aesthetic significance, because that's how Aristotle sees the realm of human affairs.</li>
  <li>For the person of good character who takes life seriously (and who by that very fact has strong reasons for loving their own existence), the prospect of losing their life in battle is far from pleasant; yet even this can be enjoyable <em>in a way</em>, if one is committed to and stays focused on the purpose or completion (τέλος) of the activity (ἐνέργεια), i.e., on doing what is beautifully right.</li>
  <li>The purpose or completion of an activity is directed by the relevant character trait (κατὰ τὴν ἕξιν), which means it is also directed by the commitments and thought processes underlying that trait, since (as we will see in Book VI) it is not possible to be completely good without also having attained some measure of wisdom (φρόνησις). Moreover, acquiring a trait involves not only wisdom but also deep commitment (προαίρεσις) and, as he says at the end of III.2, "commitment is accompanied by an account (μετὰ λόγου) and by thinking things through (διάνοια)".</li>
</ul>
<p>That's a lot to squeeze into three short chapters! We'll see Aristotle build upon these insights as he works his way through the other virtues, starting in III.10-12 with moderation.</p>

<h2><a href="1874.html">Liberty</a></h2>
<h3>2024-06-20</h3>
<p>Here are a few more thoughts on unalienable rights. In his 1748 book <cite>The Spirit of the Laws</cite> (which greatly influenced the American Founders), Montesquieu wrote:</p>
<blockquote>There is no word that admits of more various significations, and has made more different impressions on the human mind, than that of <em>liberty</em>.</blockquote>
<p>Montesquieu goes on to distinguish two primary senses of what he calls political liberty:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Constitutional liberty arises from well-defined limits on the functions of government and on the people who exercise those functions (e.g., through the separation of powers across the legislative, executive, and judicial branches).</li>
  <li>Personal liberty is the individual's sense of safety and tranquility in society, especially security against arbitrary attacks and accusations under the law (e.g., prosecution for what today we would call thought crimes).</li>
</ol>
<p>Constitutional liberty and personal liberty are two sides of the same coin, i.e., of political liberty; together, they protect and reinforce what he calls philosophical liberty, i.e., the free exercise of the will in thought and action.</p>
<p>At least, such is my reading. Even this brief overview suggests that liberty provides a connecting link between life and the pursuit of happiness, because life is activity (as Aristotle said) and the pursuit of happiness depends on freedom of thought and action.</p>

<h2><a href="1873.html">Unalienable Rights</a></h2>
<h3>2024-06-16</h3>
<p>Thinking recently about brotherhood and pluralism in an American context spurred me to reflect on the American creed expressed so succinctly in the Declaration of Independence:</p>
<blockquote>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</blockquote>
<p>But what makes a certain right <em>unalienable</em>? And are other rights <em>alienable</em>?</p>
<p>Apparently the distinction between alienable and unalienable rights was first drawn by Francis Hutcheson in his <cite>Inquiry into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue</cite> (1725), where he asserted that a right is alienable (literally, "otherable") only if it meets two conditions: (1) "If the Alienation be within our natural Power, so that it be possible for us in Fact to transfer our Right." (2) "It must appear, that to transfer such Rights may serve some valuable Purpose."</p>
<p>For example, your right to a legitimately acquired piece of property is <em>alienable</em>, since if you sell the property to me then by that very act you transfer the right over to me.</p>
<p>By contrast, consider the rights proclaimed by the Declaration:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your right to your own life is <em>unalienable</em> because you can't sell yourself into slavery, nor would there ever be a "valuable purpose" in doing so.</li>
<li>On some construals, your right to liberty (e.g., liberty of thought, judgment, feeling, opinion, belief) is also unalienable because it's impossible for someone else to think or judge or feel or form opinions or beliefs for you - these are inherently capacities and activities of individuals.</li>
<li>Similarly, you are the only person who can pursue your own happiness and fulfillment in life - it's not within anyone else's power to do that even though we are social beings, for happiness and fulfillment are in large measure constituted by the pursuit itself. Thus this right is unalienable, too.</li>
</ol>
<p>To my mind, it's significant that all three of these unalienable rights are broadly grounded in a conception of human personhood and human action. Although that conception is not uniquely American (since its sources include British law, Christian religion, Enlightenment thinking, ancient history, and classical philosophy), it was uniquely expressed in the ideals of the American founding and thus perhaps can still strengthen the ties that bind Americans together, both today and in the future.</p>

<h2><a href="1872.html">Persuasion vs. Power</a></h2>
<h3>2024-06-14</h3>
<p>In my post about pluralism the other day, I mentioned in passing a crucial proviso: those who wish to force their positions on the rest of us have thereby placed themselves outside what Michael Oakeshott called the human conversation.</p>
<p>I don't mean to idealize human relations. Every society lies somewhere on a continuum from pure power to pure persuasion, with thoroughgoing totalitarianism on one end and perhaps small-scale hunter-gatherer bands on the other end. Yet when it comes to matters of conscience and belief, I see no place for power; this is the realm of persuasion plain and simple.</p>
<p>It's true that persuasion requires both time and patience. That's why most revolutionaries have no time for time and no patience for patience: society must be overhauled from the ground up, and right now!</p>
<p>Power and persuasion are polar opposites, which is why it's so dangerous to equate the two. As we've seen with the recent college protests (starting at my alma mater Columbia University), when silence is violence then violence becomes speech. It's especially troubling and telling that this transformation has happened at institutions which for centuries were bastions of free inquiry. In the face of this deep moral and intellectual disintegration, the best we can do as individuals is to rededicate ourselves to persuasion in our own lives.</p>

<h2><a href="1871.html">Walking with Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics III.1-5</a></h2>
<h3>2024-06-11</h3>
<p>As mentioned last time, toward the end of Book II of the Nicomachean Ethics Aristotle states that character traits are things that we choose. In the first half of Book III, he provides a deeper analysis of related issues: the extent to which actions are willing or unwilling, the nature of deliberation and choice, etc. Although the discussion is somewhat technical in spots and has given scholars much to chew on, in the end it has a number of practical implications.</p>
<p>The basic question is this: are you the ultimate source (ἀρχή) of your actions and character traits? Aristotle is not impressed by arguments to the effect that you're not to blame if you do bad things while in a highly emotional state such as rage (because you could have controlled your anger) or while in ignorance of the right way to act (because it's your responsibility as an adult human being to understand the good). At root, you have a choice about how to live: it's not enough to merely wish for virtue and happiness and fulfillment; instead you need to make beautifully right commitments in life and actively deliberate about how to realize those commitments. This requires discernment and reflection to close the gap between the ideal and the real - or, as he puts it, to make your goal or completion (τέλος) of finding fulfillment (εὐδαιμονία) actually determinate in particular actions. The worthy person who takes life seriously finds a way to do this, whereas the unworthy person who tolerates injustice or wallows in decadence finds excuses for doing the wrong thing. One such excuse is the misguided belief that repeated action of a certain kind, whether good or bad, won't lead to the formation of a character trait; by contrast, Aristotle says, you'd need to be utterly lacking in awareness to not understand that people complete themselves (διατελοῦσι) through their activities (1114a9).</p>
<p>Yet he observes that actions and traits are willing in different ways: an action is up to us and under our control from start (ἀρχή) to finish (τέλος), whereas a trait is willingly begun (presumably through said actions) even though it's not easy to trace exactly how we add to it over time. However, whether and how we use or apply a trait in our actions is always up to us, so a trait still ends up being something willing.</p>
<p>At this point, Aristotle has finished his consideration of the preliminaries and is ready to dig into the thrivings of character, starting with courage. We'll pick up there next time.</p>

<h3>2024-06-10</h3>
<p>Following up on my post about brotherhood, I've continued to think about ways to cultivate a more magnanimous attitude toward other people and groups. One idea I'm trying on for size is seeing different viewpoints as contributing to the overall evolution of society. This is especially challenging in the political realm, which is mired in binary thinking, polarization, and demonization of The Other; yet, for that very reason, perhaps here such a mindshift could be especially valuable.</p>
<p>Consider a few examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Populism emphasizes the impact of government policies on the average person; absent that, self-serving elites could do whatever they please.</li>
  <li>Elitism attempts to bring the knowledge of experts to bear on societal problems; absent that, pure democracy could lead to rule by a demogogue.</li>
  <li>Conservatism values traditional ways of doing things; absent that, progressives might make such rapid changes that people couldn't adjust.</li>
  <li>Progressivism pushes for the removal of unjust laws; absent that, conservatives might never allow changes that in the end did not prove harmful.</li>
  <li>Classical liberalism advocates for freedom; absent that, individual liberties might get trampled by governments large and small.</li>
</ul>
<p>As usual, the best path forward likely lies somewhere in between and can be found only through a process that the civilizational historian Carroll Quigley called "the gradual and communal search for truth". Unfortunately, that search is too often impeded by those who think they have all the answers and who won't even consider the insights that folks with other viewpoints might bring to the table - or, worse, who wish to force their positions on the rest of us. Yes, there are many reasons for pessimism these days; yet pessimism is no way to live, and I'm optimistic that time, tolerance, moderation, and a commitment to the human conversation can overcome these obstacles.</p>
