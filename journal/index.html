<h2><a href="1742.html">Become What You Are</a></h2>
<h3>2022-10-27</h3>
<p>Following on our investigation last week of the ancient Greek maxim "Know Thyself", I thought it might be interesting to explain another Greek phrase that has gained currency in recent times: "Become What You Are".</p>
<p>In his book <cite>Personal Destinies</cite> (which I've started to re-read after a gap of perhaps 30 years and which I'll report on much more fully in future posts), philosopher David L. Norton puts "Become What You Are" on an equal footing with "Know Thyself" in ancient Greek culture. Yet this is far from the truth. "Know Thyself" was on everyone's lips (as Plato puts it) and it echoed throughout Greek culture, whereas "Become What You Are" was a single line in a poem by Pindar.</p>
<p>In Greek it reads γένοι' οἷος ἐσσὶ μαθών which we can well translate as "become such as you are, having learned what that is." The "such as you are" is key: this is not about your unique individuality but about the kind of human, mortal being you are. Pindar makes this clear in the remainder of his second Pythian Ode, where he emphasizes that "a man must always measure all things according to his own place" and that "one must not fight against a god". Indeed, Pindar's intent here is quite consistent with "Know Thyself" in the sense of knowing your place, as explained in my previous post.</p>
<p>So where did this idea come from that "Become What You Are" means something like Shakespeare's "to thine own self be true"? I finger Nietzsche, who made much of Pindar's line in his book <cite>The Joyful Wisdom</cite>. Now, I happen to like what Nietzsche did with Pindar and I even composed a poem entitled "Become What You Are" for my collection <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite>, but that doesn't imply that Pindar or the ancient Greeks in general thought about the self as we do.</p>
<p>Having cleared away some of the underbrush, next time I'll look into our modern notion of the true self.</p>

<h2><a href="1741.html">Know Thyself</a></h2>
<h3>2022-10-20</h3>
<p>The saying γνῶθι σαυτόν ("know thyself") was prominently displayed at the temple of Delphi, where ancient Greeks, Romans, Persians, and others sought answers to their most pressing questions. Yet what is it exactly to know thyself? Essential clues can be found in an obscure little book published in 1916: <cite>"Know Thyself" in Greek and Latin Literature</cite>, in which Eliza Gregory Wilkins collected almost all mentions of the maxim up until the fall of Rome.</p>
<p>Here are some of the key meanings:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Know your measure and limits. In ancient Greece, well-known examples of people who didn't know their limits were Alcibiades and Alexander the Great; the latter in particular had the hubris to think that he was a god. Less exceptional citizens might over-estimate their power, their status, their influence, the loyalty of their friends, the stability of their wealth, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>Know what you can and cannot do. This sense, which implies neither over-estimating nor under-estimating your abilities, is well illustrated by the myth of Icarus trying, impossibly, to fly to the sun. A more prosaic example is that of the Sophistic teachers, who claimed superior abilities to impart wisdom but in fact lacked such skills.</p></li>
<li><p>Know your place. Here "know thyself" verges on the virtue of moderation or self-regulation (σωφροσύνη): someone who was ignorant of his place was liable inappropriately engage in wild, immoderate, self-indulgent behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>Know the limits of your knowledge and wisdom. Consider, for example, that Alcibiades (in his eponymous dialogue) thought he was ready to take a leading part in the public affairs of Athens even though he was only 20 years old. Indeed, throughout the Socratic dialogues of both Plato and Xenophon, Socrates delights in exposing the pretensions of those who claim to know more than they really do.</p></li>
<li><p>Know your faults. As Aristotle says in the <cite>Magna Moralia</cite>, because we don't know ourselves we tend to criticize others for the very same faults that we ourselves have; one of the benefits of having close personal relationships is that our friends and relations might feel free to point out our failings even when we don't want to own up to them.</p></li>
<li><p>Know you are human and mortal. This sense was often expressed by the idea that you should stay aware that you will die eventually, with the result that you might savor your mortal existence. A related aspect was often expressed by the maxim that "one who is human should think mortal thoughts" and therefore not reach for the divine.</p></li>
<li><p>Know your soul. In tension with that last thought, knowing your soul could involve a recognition of the soul's divine origin or nature, as in Plato's <cite>Phaedo</cite> or book ten of Aristotle's <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>. Alternatively, it could involve awareness of the conflicting drives experienced by human beings, so that you could achieve greater internal harmony. Or consider Aristotle's repeated statement that we are social animals and thus need to understand interpersonal relationships in order to thrive in society.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The astute reader will have noticed that one meaning conspicuously absent in ancient times was the very one we especially treasure nowadays: knowing your singular uniqueness, discovering your true self, cherishing your individuality, and the like. I'll have more to say on this score in a future post.</p>

<h2><a href="1740.html">Agreement Is Overrated</a></h2>
<h3>2022-10-13</h3>
<p>How many times has a friend sent you a link to an essay with the proviso "I don't agree with everything this person says, but it's worth reading"? I used to do that, too, but then I reflected on whether intellectual agreement is truly important, and I concluded that it's not.</p>
<p>Part of the story is that I don't always agree with myself. Given that I've been blogging for over twenty years and was writing for publication years before then, it should come as no surprise that I don't agree with everything I wrote so long ago. Yet I don't even fully agree with things I wrote a few weeks ago! A case in point is my recent critique of Hanno Sauer's paper on the uselessness of philosophical history, since I find value in engaging philosophically with the latest scientific research rather than cloistering myself away in an exclusive study of the ancients (although I'm also convinced that the wisdom of the ancients can be rather helpful in such engagement).</p>
<p>But that's not all: thinking that I need to maintain consistency with every position I've ever held or expressed is artificially constraining. Socrates and Aristotle both said that "philosophy begins in wonder" - and wondering inevitably leads to wandering as I explore side paths, follow leads (one of my favorite parts of any book is the bibliography), make connections across thinkers and disciplines, delve into the details, seek out evidence, ponder the implications, question what I've read, and test out ideas by attempting to act on them.</p>
<p>These practices are a way of cultivating intellectual pluralism in my own head, which is more fundamental but also more difficult than respecting intellectual pluralism in society (as important as that is). One of the easiest things in the world is to persuade myself that I, uniquely among all human beings, have chanced upon the truth and that everyone else is mistaken. Well, not <em>everyone</em> else, because humans are social animals and we like to flock together with likeminded people who share a group identity as those few who have found the truth. This, of course, is why agreement feels so good and appears so obligatory in the first place, but it's a siren call that I try (not always successfully!) to resist.</p>
<p>Note: I realize that this is a controversial topic, so do feel free to disagree!</p>

<h2><a href="1739.html">Thinking Forward</a></h2>
<h3>2022-10-06</h3>
<p>Much of what makes human beings distinctive is what Jacob Bronowski called "a sense of the future" (in addition to his old book by that name, see also more recently <cite>Homo Prospectus</cite> by Seligman, Railton, Baumeister, and Sripada). Certainly most animals can think at least a few minutes or maybe hours in advance, but they're not actively planning months or years ahead of time as humans can. Yet, perhaps under the influence of modern science, our conception of our intellectual capacities is often retrospective: reason is thought to be a faculty that formulates accurate conclusions and stable laws from the evidence we have painfully gathered in the past through induction, experiment, and the like.</p>
<p>However, it seems that the function of reason in human life is just as centrally to imaginatively project future possibilities. When we are "thinking forward", we consider multiple potential routes to attaining what we want in life and from those options we attempt to make a "good enough" decision about what to do based on rough estimations of costs and benefits.</p>
<p>This has several implications for practical wisdom.</p>
<p>First, as long as we are prepared to handle the most likely future paths with some consideration of what could go wrong, then accurate prediction and precise definitions are of secondary importance. This implies that ethical rules matter much less than philosophical theorists like to think. After all, the point of such rules is reduce or eliminate the scope of individual decision-making.</p>
<p>Second, there's no completely reliable way to predict what situations we will face in life: most of them tend to be novel along various dimensions (e.g., there are different people or time pressures or practical implications involved). This doesn't mean that anything goes, but it does mean that we typically use analogical reasoning to solve problems based on similar but not identical patterns we've experienced as well as the accumulation of decisions we've made in those situations.</p>
<p>Third, a critical component of practical wisdom is means-end planning in its broadest sense. As I hinted a few weeks ago, this is not as simple as it sounds. It's one thing to figure out and visualize our goals within a long-term project or relationship (e.g., "I want to have a happy marriage"), but it's quite another to identify and successfully pursue the full range of thoughts, feelings, attitudes, virtues, principles, policies, and behaviors necessary to achieve those goals (what Aristotle called "things toward the end", many of which are not simple means but active constituents of the end).</p>
<p>For all these reasons and more, practical wisdom about our future activities holds a central place in human flourishing.</p>

<h2><a href="1738.html">Virtues: One or Many?</a></h2>
<h3>2022-09-29</h3>
<p>In a post last week about the value of studying multiple philosophies, I observed that I have not read much Christian theology. As if on queue, I decided to read Augustine's <cite>Of the Morals of the Catholic Church</cite>, written in 388 CE. The impetus was a footnote on page 179 of Daniel C. Russell's book <cite>Practical Intelligence and the Virtues</cite>, where he said that he would not consider non-secular arguments for the unity of the virtues, such as Augustine's argument that there really is only one virtue, which is the love of God.</p>
<p>This triggered a connection in my mind to Aristotle's view that the virtuous person acts for the sake of what is beautifully right (τὸ καλόν). For Aristotle, this for-the-sake-of relation is true of every excellence of character (courage, temperance, justice, generosity, benevolence, etc.). Could Augustine's position be interestingly similar to Aristotle's? Let's take a look...</p>
<p>Augustine analyzes the four classical virtues as follows (<cite>Of the Morals of the Catholic Church</cite>, Chapter 15):</p>
<blockquote>As to virtue leading us to a happy life, I hold virtue to be nothing else than perfect love of God. For the fourfold division of virtue I regard as taken from four forms of love. For these four virtues (would that all felt their influence in their minds as they have their names in their mouths!), I should have no hesitation in defining them: that temperance is love giving itself entirely to that which is loved; fortitude is love readily bearing all things for the sake of the loved object; justice is love serving only the loved object, and therefore ruling rightly; prudence is love distinguishing with sagacity between what hinders it and what helps it. The object of this love is not anything, but only God, the chief good, the highest wisdom, the perfect harmony. So we may express the definition thus: that temperance is love keeping itself entire and incorrupt for God; fortitude is love bearing everything readily for the sake of God; justice is love serving God only, and therefore ruling well all else, as subject to man; prudence is love making a right distinction between what helps it towards God and what might hinder it.</blockquote>
<p>Although we think of Aristotle as a secular (or at least pre-Christian) thinker, at the very end of the <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite> his ethical reflections take a decidedly theological turn (something similar happens at the end of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>). There he argues that whatever conduces to the cultivation (θεραπεία) and awareness (θεωρία) of god or the divine is best and is the most beautifully right standard for choice and action regarding natural goods such as health, wealth, power, reputation, even personal relationships. The reasons for this theological turn (or was it there all along?) are complex and not entirely clear to me, but I think they involve an ideal of emulating what Aristotle takes to be the divine: the pure activity (ἐνέργεια) of awareness (θεωρία). On this topic I wrote as follows in a blog post from 2019:</p>
<blockquote>Beings are divine to the extent that they engage in the activity of awareness. Thus the highest and best being would, as a kind of limit case, be the one that is self-contained, independent, unchanging, well-ordered, fully aware, and fully engaged in the activity of awareness. Thus human beings are best to the extent that partake in these same qualities (indeed, we form our ideas of the divine from our experience of what is best in human life).</blockquote>
<p>I freely grant that this is all quite speculative. Moreover, having read literally hundreds of scholarly books and articles on Aristotle, I can say definitively that very few modern philosophers are comfortable when Aristotle starts talking about the divine (and some of those few get it quite wrong, for instance when Richard Bodeus argues that Aristotle was defending the conventional, polytheistic religion of classical Greece). Yet Aristotle thought both that a conception of the divine is closely connected to beautifully right commitment and action, and that all excellent human activity is motivated by love and awareness of the highest good. Such ideas might have grounded the widely-accepted ancient doctrine (forms of which we find in Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, and Augustine) that the seemingly separate virtues are really all one thing. As to what the "cash value" of this doctrine might be, I'll explore that in a future post.</p>

<h2><a href="1737.html">What Is Philosophy For?</a></h2>
<h3>2022-09-25</h3>
<p>Occasionally one reads something so singularly misguided that it puts into stark relief a vital concern of human existence. In the case at hand, the vital concern is the place of philosophy in the best life for human beings and the piece of writing is a scholarly paper published just last week by philosopher Hanno Sauer, entitled "The End of History."</p>
<p>Professor Sauer argues that there is little value to be gained in reading the so-called great philosophers of human history: Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, Epictetus, Confucius, Lao Tzu, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza, Hume, Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and all the rest. Sure, their works might be enjoyable and might give us insights into the strange things that people believed in the past, but they are useless toward solving the most important philosophical problems. As he so succinctly puts it: "The epistemic aims of philosophy, if there are any, are largely frustrated by engaging with the history of philosophy."</p>
<p>Naturally this raises the question: what are the aims of philosophy? Philosophy itself, of course, has no aims, any more than biology or history does; it's human beings who have aims and goals and purposes. And the human beings whom Professor Sauer has in mind are his fellow practitioners of theoretical philosophy, whose aims are, as he puts it, epistemic. In ancient Greek, ἐπιστήμη was deep understanding of a particular domain and an ἐπιστημής was a person possessing that kind of deep understanding - in modern parlance, an expert. Thus the question of "the epistemic aims of philosophy" can be converted into this: "what is the role in human life of experts in theoretical philosophy?"</p>
<p>All the ancient philosophers - Greek, Chinese, Indian, Roman - were in agreement that philosophy is the love of wisdom and that wisdom help us make good everyday decisions about how to live well as human beings in human societies; thus philosophy is primarily a way of life and only very much secondarily a theoretical pursuit. As one prominent example, Aristotle held that wisdom (σοφία) is a combination of knowledge (ἐπιστήμη) and insight (νοῦς); thus the epistemic aims of philosophy do not stand alone but must be wedded to insight into the highest good attainable by human beings.</p>
<p>When I first discovered Pierre Hadot's reconstruction of philosophy as a way of life over ten years ago, I summarized this ancient viewpoint as follows:</p>
<blockquote>To be a philosopher meant to live a philosophical life: not a life of theoretical hair-splitting, but a life of practical wisdom, active reason and reasoned action, deep reflection, true consciousness, vibrant awareness, moral ambition, never-ending spiritual practice, continual striving after self-improvement, the exercise of all your faculties, skillfulness in the great task of living a fully human life.</blockquote>
<p>Therefore the class of philosophical problems that Professor Sauer and his ilk see as central - the nature of knowledge, of the human mind, of natural laws, of linguistic meaning, and even of a just society - take a back seat to the personal cultivation of human virtue and excellence. From this perspective, experts in theoretical philosophy must play a decidedly nonessential role in human life - which is exactly the role they play nowadays, since they are writing only for each other, and even their colleagues in related fields of science and scholarship rarely listen to them, let alone the general public.</p>
<p>This is ironic, because Professor Sauer argues that philosophers of the past have nothing to add to "current philosophical debates," the reason being that they lacked the most up-to-date "empirical and scientific information" (say, fMRI studies within neuropsychology). It is unclear what he would consider to be the expiration date for intellectual relevance, but in relation to his preferred philosophical problems it could be a matter of mere years. Indeed, his focus on "current philosophical debates" shows where his allegiances lie: with philosophy as a sort of cutting-edge scientific or mathematical research, ever chasing the most novel arguments, the latest proofs, the hottest controversies.</p>
<p>Moreover, even when Professor Sauer grants that philosophy has its humanistic aspects, all that he can conjure up is "preserving the cultural heritage of humanity" and "sustaining our ability to comprehend a body of difficult texts whose content may fade into oblivion without such stewardship." However, if those texts are literally harmful, what's the point? We'd all be better off forgetting about outdated works of philosophy. Paraphrasing the hippies, don't read anything over thirty!</p>
<p>This kind of presentism entails numerous dangers, well summarized by Santayana's maxim "Those who cannot remember the past, are condemned to repeat it." Yet most fundamentally, it demonstrates utter ignorance of the truly humanistic role of philosophy in the life of the individual and society: not philological preservation of difficult and useless old texts, but active guidance toward successful living and human flourishing.</p>
