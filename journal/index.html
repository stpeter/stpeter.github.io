<h2><a href="1735.html">Decisions Accumulate</a></h2>
<h3>2022-09-15</h3>
<p>In a recent post entitled "How a Business Wins", Arnold Kling made the following observation:</p>
<blockquote>Building a business, especially an innovative business in a complex environment, requires many, many decisions. You can be lucky with any one decision, but to get enough decisions right to make the business work takes much more than luck.</blockquote>
<p>As hinted in my post "Compounding Wisdom" two years ago, this insight applies to more than just business. Your health, your marriage, your friendships, your financial stability, your character - long-term success in each of these requires many decisions over the course of many years.</p>
<p>The fundamental principle involved was identified by Aristotle 2400 years ago: we are what we habitually do. Therefore it's crucial to develop a consistent <em>practice</em> of good decision-making, which is what Aristotle called practical wisdom (in ancient Greek, φρόνησις). I've been giving a lot of thought to this topic of late and will have more to say about it in the coming weeks.</p>

<h2><a href="1734.html">Means and Ends</a></h2>
<h3>2022-09-08</h3>
<p>Last week we looked at the distinction between internal goods, external goods, and shared goods. At that time I touched on a further distinction between means and ends in life. Here again Aristotle can be of assistance, because he discusses these matters in his two major books about character and action, which have come down to us as the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> and the <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite>.</p>
<p>Significantly, for Aristotle these means to an end are not always or primarily instrumental. Indeed, the phrase usually translated as "means" actually denotes "things toward the end", i.e., good things that enable us to accomplish our ends or goals. Several modern scholars of Aristotle have observed that these good things can be essential constituents or integral components of our ends or goals. Moreover, for Aristotle the goal or purpose (τέλος) of life is a form of characteristic human activity that simply IS living well. Thus for Aristotle eudaimonia (traditionally translated as "happiness" but often more recently as "flourishing") is not a feeling but an activity.</p>
<p>Consider the example of marriage. For the sake of discussion, let's define marriage as (ideally) a lifelong partnership in pursuit of the best that life has to offer founded in mutual love, respect, dialogue, and compassion. Imagine that someone who is offered the possibility of that experience were to say: "that sounds great, but what's in it for me?" The implication is that it's not enough for such a relationship to constitute an essential component of their flourishing existence; they want the relationship to provide a guarantee of their own personal pleasure and satisfaction.</p>
<p>From an Aristotelian perspective, this is incoherent. Because we are social animals, the presence of such a relationship in one's life is directly fulfilling and enjoyable, for it is integral to living the best life for a human being. To view such a relationship in an instrumental fashion is to assume that one's own pleasure and satisfaction is the primary good in life; that is, it is to accept the ethical philosophy of hedonism. And, in turn, that philosophy is false because it doesn't do justice to the full range and depth of human activity.</p>

<h2><a href="1733.html">Good Things Come in Threes</a></h2>
<h3>2022-09-01</h3>
<p>In my recent post "There's No Such Thing as the Mind", I expressed astonishment at a statement by Italian philosopher Maurizio Ferraris to the effect that one's body is part of the external world. This raises the question of what exactly is internal vs. external, and how to categorize the various good things we value in life.</p>
<p>A distinction between external goods and other goods goes back at least as far as Aristotle, for whom these "other goods" included goods of the body and goods of the soul. External goods include wealth, possessions, reputation, honor, status, power, position, and other results of good fortune in life. Goods of the body include health, strength, vitality, and the like. Goods of the soul include knowledge, wisdom, awareness, memory, experience, emotions, talents, skills, character, personality, and so on.</p>
<p>On this schema, it's not completely clear to me how to categorize certain good things in life. (Not that categorizing things is necessarily all that meaningful!) For instance, take skills like the ability to play the piano: in some ways it's a good of the soul but in other ways it's a good of the body (we talk about muscle memory and knowledge being in your fingers and such). Note that this is yet another reason not to draw hard boundaries between body and soul; we can consider both goods of the body and goods of the soul to be internal goods.</p>
<p>Another key example is that of close personal relationships (what Aristotle calls φιλία - usually translated as friendship but in ancient Greek it included marriage, family, and partnerships of many kinds). Aristotle says that friends are the greatest of external goods, but this doesn't feel quite right. Enlightenment on this topic came to me recently in reading <cite>Virtue and Psychology</cite> by Blaine Fowers, who carves out, in addition to external goods and internal goods, a category of shared goods. These are good things that arise only through coordinated activity among two or more people, such as friendship, marriage, family, teamwork, service, solidarity, and community.</p>
<p>What's the upshot of all this categorizing? In practice, is it helpful to understand whether a good thing in your life is internal, external, or shared? I think so.</p>
<p>Consider, for instance, the prospect of getting fired (which has happened to me twice in my career). True, it's no fun to lose your job (an external good), but knowing that you still have the underlying skills and talents (internal goods) that enabled you to be a productive worker in the first place can give you confidence that the loss is in all likelihood only temporary.</p>
<p>Consider, also, the importance of close personal relationships like marriage and friendship. In her book <cite>Friendship, Robots, and Social Media</cite>, Alexis Elder provides an excellent account of how a friendship is a joint project - a kind of "third thing" above and beyond the two persons involved. (Although I haven't read it yet, I gather that Terry Real makes similar points with regard to marriage in his book <cite>Us: Getting Past You and Me to Build a More Loving Relationship</cite>.) It's not as if this kind of partnership is a purely instrumental means to the independent end of my own pleasant experiences; instead, the partnership is an inherent constituent of living well. More on this theme next week...</p>

<h2><a href="1732.html">Thoughts, Actions, Values</a></h2>
<h3>2022-08-25</h3>
<p>Aristotle's <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> famously begins with the following sentence (as translated by W.D. Ross):</p>
<blockquote>Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things aim.</blockquote>
<p>We can see here a point of connection between my two recent posts "There's No Such Thing as the Mind" and "It's Values All the Way Down". For Aristotle, who founded the science of biology, all of our physical activities <em>and also all of our intellectual activities</em> are rooted in the needs and yearnings of our aliveness.</p>
<p>The equally famous first sentence of Aristotle's <cite>Metaphysics</cite> goes like this (translated by yours truly):</p>
<blockquote>All people naturally reach out to know.</blockquote>
<p>Yet he means not disembodied minds seeking value-free science, but living, breathing human beings seeking value-infused sagacity (σοφία). In line with Aristotle's threefold analyses of both ethical and intellectual virtues, the opposites of sagacity are on the one hand ignorance (the absolute lack of knowledge) and on the other hand sophistry (mere knowledge without the benefit of insight into or guidance by what is best).</p>
<p>The fact that no human endeavors, not even our intellectual endeavors, are completely value-neutral is not something to be lamented but something to be celebrated, because it is a sign and consequence of our deeply integrated nature as thinking, acting, valuing creatures.</p>

<h2><a href="1731.html">Meditations on Bach #11: Mocha 5 Bass</a></h2>
<h3>2022-08-23</h3>
<p>I'm delighted to report that today I took delivery of a custom-made Symphony electric bass from Stradi Basses in Poland. It is absolutely gorgeous, sounds wonderful, and plays beautifully! Luthier Marek Dąbek was a dream to work with and he met all of my requirements with true craftsmanship and creativity, building with the expert assistance of his wife Agnieska an instrument we're calling the "Mocha 5". I now have a magnificent five-string bass, natively tuned in fifths using custom strings by Italian string maker Galli, that will provide a strong foundation for my transcriptions of the Bach Cello Suites (as well as some original solo bass pieces I'm composing). Wow! Thank you, Marek and Agnieska!</p>

<h2><a href="1730.html">It's Values All the Way Down</a></h2>
<h3>2022-08-18</h3>
<p>One often hears the claim that science must be value-neutral, especially in social sciences like economics, psychology, and sociology. This claim is one instance of fact-value dualism: the doctrine that facts are facts, values are values, and never the twain shall meet. Another instance of this dualism is the assertion (traceable to British empiricist David Hume) that you can't derive an "ought" from an "is".</p>
<p>Given my well-known aversion to dualisms of all kinds, it should come as no surprise that I'm not impressed by these claims and assertions. For those who are inclined to theoretical philosophy, a fine rebuttal can be found in Hilary Putnam's book <cite>The Collapse of the Fact/Value Dichotomy</cite>. Here's how I would illustrate the matter in a more homely fashion...</p>
<p>Empiricist: Science must be value-neutral!</p>
<p>Me: So you're saying that scientists ought to practice value-neutrality?</p>
<p>Empiricist: Yes, of course!</p>
<p>Me: Or, in other words, that value-neutrality is a core value of all scientific endeavor?</p>
<p>Empiricist: Indeed it is!</p>
<p>Me: Well then, it sounds like science isn't value-neutral with regard to the value of value-neutrality, is it?</p>
<p>Empiricist: Hmm...</p>
<p>This might sound like a purely abstract issue, but it has very practical consequences. For instance, in economics the doctrine of fact-value dualism leads theorists to say that all we can study is utility-maximization; because utility is essentially equivalent to pleasure (cf. Jeremy Bentham) or in scientifically dressed up language "desire satisfaction", this doctrine effectively smuggles hedonism in through the back door. So much for value-neutrality!</p>
<p>The solution to this kind of smuggling is to trade openly in values, as it were: to be honest about the values we bring to the topic before us, to engage in dialogue with those who see things differently, to critique and revise our commitments where necessary, and so on. Naturally, this is difficult and messy, but it's much more realistic and reasonable than trying to rule values out of court with a wave of one's hand.</p>
