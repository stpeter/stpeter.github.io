<h2><a href="1702.html">A New Focus</a></h2>
<h3>2022-02-17</h3>
<p>After 25 years in the tech industry, I've decided it's time for a new focus in life. Last Friday was my last day at Mozilla, and my wife Elisa and I are already hard at work on a non-tech venture: a training program that we hope will help people develop professionally by applying the insights of psychological research and the great wisdom traditions to the challenges and opportunities of work and career.</p>
<p>Elisa and I have long wanted to work together and we're excited about what we each bring to this venture. After working in finance for many years, Elisa earned a PhD in industrial-organizational psychology, so she has deep knowledge of the scientific basis for flourishing at work. She's also taught subjects such as teamwork, theories of leadership, leadership development, challenges for first-time managers, causes of derailment, and organizational power and politics at the MBA level. She is also active as a professional business coach. Most recently she's explored the scholarly literature on positive psychology, a relatively young field that casts fresh light on the role of character strengths in personal success as well as best practices for happiness in general.</p>
<p>For myself, in parallel with my technology and business background, I've been studying the great philosophers my whole life. In the last few years I've concentrated primarily on Aristotle, whose virtue-based approach to ethics provides the most solid intellectual foundation for the study of character and human fulfillment. In addition, prior to my first job in technology I worked in training and instructional design, and my experience collaborating closely with customers and partners over the last ten years will likely come in handy when Elisa and I start working with companies and individuals.</p>
<p>Although it'll be a few months before we're ready to beta test our initial offering, I already have a growing list of people who want to participate, so drop me a line via email, LinkedIn, or Twitter if you might have an interest.</p>

<h2><a href="1701.html">Opinions, Expectations, and Emotions</a></h2>
<h3>2022-02-15</h3>
<p>Following up on my series of posts about the phenomenon of opinion, I've been pondering the relationship between opinions, expectations, and emotions.</p>
<p>It's well known that emotions are based on a conception of how things are or should be (as a simple example, one person might get excited by a Fourth of July fireworks display whereas another might find it offputting because they don't like crowds and loud noises). If my conception of things is, say, false or incomplete or misleading or just different from what the people around me believe, then it's quite possible that I might experience negative emotions.</p>
<p>I first explored these topics in my 2013 book <cite>Letters on Happiness: An Epicurean Dialogue</cite>. The ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus examined various dyads of emotion and misunderstanding; the classic Epicurean example is a misguided fear of death leading to a groundless desire for immortality, since both the fear and the desire are based on fundamental misconceptions about life and death. I then extended his analysis to a number of other emotions, such as desires for status, power, and fame.</p>
<p>Most directly for the topic at hand, I might be of the opinion that other people should behave in line with my expectations, but if they don't then I'll likely experience negative emotions such as surprise, disappointment, irritation, frustration, resentment, anger, or offense. Yet as I described in my post "Philosophy and Anger", this opinion is ill-founded.</p>
<p>Here we become aware that opinions are not a purely intellectual matter, but instead have real-world consequences for your day-to-day emotional state. Holding fewer opinions and holding opinions less strongly can lead to greater serenity in life, which is priceless.</p>

<h2><a href="1700.html">Meditations on Bach #10: Philosophy in Music</a></h2>
<h3>2022-02-10</h3>
<p>In the second edition of his extremely intriguing book <cite>Bach: The Fencing Master</cite>, cellist Anner Bylsma writes as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
Why did Bach write these Suites for violoncello without bass; for whom; and for which occasion? The second and last questions probably have to be answered: for himself. The first one: for all of us or for science - because these Suites are, without a doubt, a scientific work.<br><br>
Why did Bach write these Cello Suites? Take my word: for philosophy! A lot of explanation will be needed, but I am not even sure I will find a willing ear.<br><br>
Bach lived in the Age of Enlightenment, when people dressed up with enormous wigs, proud and happy to know that the working of their brains was more important than the doctrines of religion. Philosophy and logic are the basis of all knowledge in this period, rather than faith and its consequences. Precision in thinking and writing became of the utmost importance; think of Spinoza's Caute ('Precision').<br><br>
Bach's works are philosophy in music.
</blockquote>
<p>It's no surprise that Bylsma's speculations appeal to me (see my previous posts "Aristotle and Bach" and "Musical Monadology"). Perhaps my only quibble is with the opposition of philosophy and religion, because I suspect that Bach's God had a passion for order, coherence, and proportion.</p>
<p>We cannot prove these hypotheses only through writing and analysis, but must find the truth of them in the music itself. My explorations continue...</p>

<h2><a href="1699.html">Jealousy and Envy</a></h2>
<h3>2022-02-10</h3>
<p>A friend recently asked me how I would characterize the difference between jealousy and envy. Here's how I see it: jealousy is when I want to gain something you have, and envy is when I want you to lose something you have. If I'm jealous of your new Tesla, I want a Tesla too. If I'm envious of the superyacht that Jeff Bezos is building, I don't want him to have that yacht even if I'll never be able to have such a thing.</p>
<p>There's a murky zone involving "rivalrous goods" that only one of us can possess. The classic case is love: if both you and I want to be married to the same person, in most cultures only one of us can win. The same could be true of promotions at work, political appointments, and the like. One way to look at these cases is to say that jealousy and envy overlap or that I'm feeling both jealousy and envy.</p>
<p>Because jealousy has a positive component (I want X) whereas envy seems purely negative (I don't want you to have Y), it strikes me that the remedies differ. When I feel jealousy, I can educate and temper my acquisitive desires to not want X (do I really "need" that shiny new Tesla?). When I feel envy, I can do a better job of accepting the good fortune of other people - even if it is excessive or undeserved (naturally, this can be especially hard to swallow!).</p>
<p>I'll end with my translation of a quote from Epicurus (Vatican Sayings #53):</p>
<blockquote>Envy no one. For good people do not deserve envy, and the more that wicked people succeed the more they ruin things for themselves.</blockquote>

<h2><a href="1698.html">Delphic Wisdom and Modern Science</a></h2>
<h3>2022-02-04</h3>
<p>Carved into the walls of the ancient Greek temple at Delphi were two proverbs: γνῶθι σεαυτόν ("know thyself") and μηδὲν ἄγαν ("nothing too much"). Plato mentions them in his dialogue Protagoras, set around 434 BCE, but most likely they were common among the Greeks as far back as 600 BCE or even earlier. Although they are so very old, recently I've been pondering their connection to the latest research in the modern science of psychology.</p>
<p>First, consider "know thyself". This has clear applications to personality psychology. In order to make use of the relevant scientific insights, you need to not only understand the theory but complete a valid, reliable personality inventory (preferably based on the five-factor model), and then reflect on how those personality traits are expressed in your attitudes and behavior. This gives you a store of self-knowledge that can guide better choices and decisions in your life.</p>
<p>Second, consider "nothing too much". The Positive Psychology movement has identified a number of character strengths that show up across most or all human cultures, and has created inventories that enable you to identify your greatest strengths. Although it might sound ideal to cultivate and leverage your strengths (say, empathy) at home and at work, psychological research has shown that it's all too easy to overplay your strengths. As one example, if all you do is empathize with others then you might accept mistreatment in an abusive relationship, overlook ethical lapses by your co-workers, or neglect to insist on effective performance by your employees. Too much of a good thing, indeed.</p>
<p>It strikes me that there's a tension between these two proverbs, because a key foundation for the rise of ancient Greek philosophy was the idea that you can never have too much wisdom or self-knowledge. But that's a topic for another day...</p>

<h2><a href="1697.html">Philosophical Professionalism</a></h2>
<h3>2022-02-01</h3>
<p>Robin Hanson recently suggested that we need more generalist thinkers, and that they can be found among the ranks of polymaths, public intellectuals, and professional philosophers. Although I might post again on the topic of generalists vs. specialists, today I'd like to focus instead on the concept of philosophical professionalism.</p>
<p>In most fields, a professional is one who gets paid to perform a task or offer a service; thus we speak of professional musicians or athletes as opposed to amateurs. We also say that certain lines of work are professions because they are preceded by long years of training or require certification or licensure: doctoring, nursing, lawyering, and the like. By extension, persons and activities are said to be professional if they meet certain standards of skill or expertise. Thus by "professional philosopher" Hanson likely means someone who has completed a PhD in philosophy, who teaches philosophy in a college or university, who publishes in academic philosophy journals, and so on (I doubt that he includes philosophical counselors).</p>
<p>How well do these notions of professionalism apply to philosophy in its deepest sense as the love and practice of wisdom? Here things get murky. For instance, Socrates, the archetypical philosopher in the Western tradition, wasn't a professional because he didn't seek or accept payment (as the Sophists did), nor did he receive training from recognized experts (which at that time I suppose would have been the selfsame Sophists). Furthermore, it's unclear how or whether today's standard academic training in philosophy - consisting as it does in the study of theoretical arguments, suitably analyzed and footnoted - leads to <em>wisdom</em>.</p>
<p>Indeed, what would it mean to practice wisdom <em>professionally</em>? Practicing wisdom itself seems quite different from practicing, say, law or medicine: there's no recognized body of knowledge and skills in which one can be trained and tested, there's no specific venue (such as a law court or hospital) in which one applies one's knowledge and skills, etc. An analogy with psychology might be more appropriate than that of academic philosophy, since there are theoretical psychologists, experimental psychologists, applied psychologists (e.g., in the workplace), and clinical psychologists (the closest thing to philosophical practitioners), etc.</p>
<p>And we won't even ask the provocative question of what it means to be a professional lover, of wisdom or anything else!</p>
<p>In the first chapter of <cite>Walden</cite>, Henry David Thoreau observed:</p>
<blockquote>There are nowadays professors of philosophy, but not philosophers. Yet it is admirable to profess because it was once admirable to live. To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically.</blockquote>
<p>You don't need a PhD or a university position or a long list of academic publications to "solve some of the problems of life" and to "live according to the dictates of wisdom". Although professor Martha Nussbaum once said that a philosopher is a professional human being, I would hope that being human is not the kind of thing that can or should be professionalized: it's the birthright of every person on the planet to exercise their highest potential by loving and practicing wisdom in their own life to the greatest extent possible.</p>
