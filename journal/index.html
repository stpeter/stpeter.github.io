<h2><a href="1753.html">Approaching Excellence</a></h2>
<h3>2022-12-21</h3>
<p>Aristotle is famous for his so-called doctrine of the mean: a particular excellence of character is not the opposite of a single fault (e.g., courage vs. cowardice) but is intermediate between excess and defect (e.g., courage is opposed to both rashness and cowardice). Although some scholars never go deeper than this surface understanding, as I see it "that which is intermediate" (τὸ μέσον) is merely a first approximation to excellence, because there's an awful lot of space in the middle between going far beyond the mean and falling far short of it.</p>
<p>Within this large realm of the intermediate, then, a second approximation in a given situation might be "that which is appropriate or fitting" (τὸ πρέπον). This is likely what Aristotle had in mind when in Book II, Chapter 9 of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> he said:</p>
<blockquote>Anyone can get angry — that is easy — or give or spend money; but to do this to the right person, to the right extent, at the right time, with the right motive, and in the right way, that is not for every one, nor is it easy.</blockquote>
<p>(Actually, all those instances of the word "right" from W.D. Ross's translation aren't in the original Greek at line 1109a28, which in Aristotle's usual compressed style reads only "but to whom and how much and when and for what sake and how".)</p>
<p>Yet "that which is appropriate" doesn't sound very inspiring, does it? Perhaps, then, a third approximation to excellence is "that which is beautifully right" (τὸ καλόν), for throughout his ethical works Aristotle emphasizes that the deeply virtuous person acts for the sake of τὸ καλόν. Think, for instance, of a time when someone you know not only did an intermediate thing or an appropriate thing but did something that had an stunning beauty or ineluctable rightness about it: a gift, a compliment, a decision, a remark, an action that was simply magnificent or utterly felicitous or deeply honorable or, as Aristotle says, beautifully right.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a high standard to reach, when we are able. But it just might be the height to which Aristotle calls us.</p>

<h2><a href="1752.html">The Inner Revolution</a></h2>
<h3>2022-12-15</h3>
<p>One of the key themes of Tolstoy's <cite>War and Peace</cite> (which I'm currently reading for the first time) is self-deception. The reader quickly perceives that Nikolai Rostov, Andrei Bolkonsky, and many other characters are fooling themselves about their own worth, thoughts, and actions. There is a connection here to a famous quote from Tolstoy:</p>
<blockquote>
Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself.
</blockquote>
<p>To think of changing oneself, one must first know oneself with unblemished honesty, which is far easier said than done. Indeed, as I am fond of saying:</p>
<blockquote>The easiest thing in the world is self-deception.</blockquote>
<p>We're all too aware that the world is immersed in ceaseless commentary about societal and political matters. Everyone has opinions about the changes they would like to see in the world, and some people have such strong opinions that they believe it's necessary first of all to destroy the existing order of things. No moderation for them: the only solution is revolution!</p>
<p>This is where we can appreciate another great quote from Tolstoy:</p>
<blockquote>
There can be only one permanent revolution - a moral one: the regeneration of the inner man.
</blockquote>
<p>Yet people are much more willing to advocate and agitate for the outer revolution of political regeneration, because the inner revolution is the hardest of all. Climbing the ladder of moral improvement requires extraordinary self-discipline, as we learn from all the greatest ethical and religious thinkers: Confucius, Buddha, Socrates, Aristotle, Epictetus, Augustine, Spinoza, et al. It was with good reason that Spinoza ended his <cite>Ethics</cite> with the following sentence:</p>
<blockquote> 
All things excellent are as difficult as they are rare.
</blockquote> 
<p>That doesn't mean it's not worth trying. After all, another of my aphorisms is this:</p>
<blockquote> 
You don't have to achieve an ideal to realize the benefits of idealism.
</blockquote>

<h2><a href="1751.html">Effective Altruism and Ineffective Egoism</a></h2>
<h3>2022-12-08</h3>
<p>The collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire at FTX and Alameda Research has cast a shadow over the "effective altruism" movement, of which he was a major financer. Ironically, I would argue that in the end he failed at altruism because he was an ineffective egoist!</p>
<p>Consider the utter mess he's made of his life: his company destroyed, his reputation ruined, his relationships in tatters, his future decidedly uncertain (he might be facing jail time), etc. Beyond and before these external goods, consider also what the ancients called goods of the soul: his lack of integrity, self-regulation, moderation, humility, good judgment, and other essential excellences of character.</p>
<p>Now, I think that drawing too sharp a distinction between egoism and altruism is an example of creating a false dichotomy, since the two phenomena tend to merge in any truly healthy marriage, friendship, team, or community. Indeed, SBF missed the mark (to put it mildly!) with regard to both enlightened self-interest and philanthropic benevolence.</p>
<p>Sadly, the rot goes much deeper than any one person. In <cite>What We Owe to the Future</cite>, the philosophic manifesto of the effective altruism movement, William MacAskill has put forth a position he calls longtermism, which at root is utilitarianism projected forward in time. What struck me most about MacAskill's book is precisely that he too lacks a clear and complete conception of human flourishing (more on that in another post). Yet having a deep understanding of living well is the only sustainable foundation for helping ourselves and helping others, both in the far future and in the here and now.</p>
<p>Thus step one is to get our intellectual house in order and truly know ourselves as human beings. Thankfully, the required insights can be found throughout the great wisdom traditions. To paraphrase Isaac Newton, all we really need to do is polish the stones we find on the shores of the great ocean of truth. On the other hand, living up to these ideals might be slightly more challenging...</p>

<h2><a href="1750.html">The Mathematics of Freedom</a></h2>
<h3>2022-12-02</h3>
<p>While reading about the recent protests in China against the government's Zero Covid policy (and, more generally, the totalitarian surveillance state established by the Chinese Communist Party), I was reminded of a fascinating quote from logician Kurt Gödel extending the results of his Incompleteness Theorem to matters of society and governance:</p>
<blockquote>A completely unfree society (i.e., one proceeding in everything by strict rules of "conformity") will, in its behavior, be either inconsistent or incomplete, i.e., unable to solve certain problems, perhaps of vital importance. Both, of course, may jeopardize its survival in a difficult situation. A similar remark would also apply to individual human beings.</blockquote>
<p>It strikes me that the CCP is running up against some of these problems of vital importance. They are certain that they have discovered all the truths of human society, that human experience is finite and exhaustible, that they can solve all problems through the pseudo-scientific formalisms of dialectical materialism and Marxist-Leninist-Maoist theory.</p>
<p>Yet the Russian novelist Yevgeny Zamyatin identified the fallacies of such thinking as far back as the 1920s:</p>
<blockquote>Fortunately, all truths are erroneous. This is the very essence of the dialectical process: today's truths become errors tomorrow; there is no final number. This truth (the only one) is for the strong alone. Weak-nerved minds insist on a finite universe, a last number; they need, in Nietzsche's words, "the crutches of certainty." The weak-nerved lack the strength to include themselves in the dialectical syllogism.</blockquote>
<p>Although we might think of mathematics as cold and forbidding, Gödel and Zamyatin perceived a connection between mathematics and humanity: both are incompletable and inexhaustible; they cannot be utterly formalized under a fully consistent and complete set of rigid rules; there is no final truth, no final certainty, no final number; freedom is an inherent condition of every human activity, even mathematics.</p>
<p>Is there a certain cosmic justice in the fact that some Chinese students held up printouts of the Friedmann ("freed-man") equation while speaking out against totalitarian tyranny? Perhaps more than they know...</p>

<h2><a href="1749.html">Can a Nietzschean Be a Feminist?</a></h2>
<h3>2022-12-01</h3>
<p>In one of my earliest blog posts (written in 1996!), I explained why I'm a female chauvinist. This attitude can be hard to square with my mostly positive perspective on Friedrich Nietzsche, which I explored in my book <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite>. After all, Nietzsche is notorious for spewing vitriol and venom regarding the role of women in modern society. Unfortunately, this is something that his admirers often prefer to sweep under the rug.</p>
<p>One worthy exception is Hedwig Dohm (1831-1919), an early activist for women's rights in Germany and an eminently clear thinker all on her own. In Dohm's essay "Nietzsche and Women", she masterfully rebuts and refutes Nietzsche point by point, using his own words and ideas to expose his ignorance and inconsistencies. As one example, she observes that Nietzsche's blathering about women belonging in a harem would bring us not one step closer to producing the Übermensch of his dreams.</p>
<p>Yet rather than condemn Nietzsche entirely, Dohm takes inspiration toward a kind of Nietzschean feminism from hints of a more constructive conception in his writings, such as §74 of <cite>The Joyful Wisdom</cite>: "A deep and powerful alto voice ... suddenly raises the curtain upon possibilities that we usually do not believe in. All at once we believe that somewhere in the world there could be women with lofty, heroic, royal souls, capable of and ready for mastery over men, because in them the best of man aside from his sex has become an incarnate ideal."</p>
<p>Although Dohm does not put it this way, Nietzsche the great classicist should have known that this vision was not merely potential but actual. What of Aspasia of Miletus, advisor to Pericles and teacher to Socrates? What of Hypatia of Alexandria, mathematician, astronomer, and Neoplatonic philosopher? In post-classical times, what of Heloise, who held her own intellectually with Abelard? What of Queen Christina of Sweden, who engaged in philosophical correspondence with the likes of Gassendi and Descartes? What of George Eliot, who completed the first translation into English of Spinoza's <cite>Ethics</cite>? And so on.</p>
<p>In the end, Dohm recognizes that Nietzsche was quite simply blind (willfully or not) regarding the highest potential of women, and quotes §226 of <cite>Daybreak</cite> to good effect: "Even great spirits have only their five-fingers' breadth of experience; just beyond it their thinking ceases and their endless empty space and stupidity begins."</p>
<p>Dohm's essay is well worth reading in its entirety, and can be found in <cite>Women Philosophers in the Long Nineteenth Century</cite>, edited by Dalia Nassar and Kristin Gjesdal.</p>

<h2><a href="1748.html">RFC 9325: TLS Recommendations</a></h2>
<h3>2022-11-30</h3>
<p>Back in 2015, I co-authored an IETF specification (RFC 7525) describing best practices for the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) on the Internet. Much has happened since then: new security vulnerabilities, new deployment scenarios, and especially a new version of the TLS protocol (RFC 8446, published in August 2018). Thus it was time for us to define updated recommendations, which Yaron Sheffer, Thomas Fossati, and I have just done in RFC 9325. For more detailed information about the changes we made, take a few minutes to read Yaron's blog post.</p>
