<h2><a href="1880.html">Iambic Observations</a></h2>
<h3>2024-07-09</h3>
<p>If I do decide to write an epic poem about Pyrrho and Alexander the Great, I would do so in blank verse, i.e., in unrhymed iambic pentameter. Toward that end, recently I found myself re-reading <cite>All the Fun's in How You Say a Thing: An Explanation of Meter and Versification</cite> by Timothy Steele, one of my favorite living poets. This is an extremely helpful book for anyone who wants to write - or gain a greater appreciation for - metrical poetry in English, from Chaucer to the present day. Here are some of the lessons I learned this time around...</p>
<p>One of the challenges with iambic pentameter is avoiding a sing-song effect (da-DUM-da-DUM-da-DUM-da-DUM, endlessly repeated); this is especially important in long poems, where such sameness becomes cloying after a while. There are a number of ways to avoid this problem: substituting trochaic for iambic feet here and there (most commonly in the first foot of the line, but sometimes in the second, third, or fourth foot, e.g., if there is a grammatical transition at that juncture); occasionally using the so-called feminine ending, where instead of having ten syllables the line tacks on a weak eleventh syllable; artfully including lines of iambic hexameter here and there (e.g., as the third line of a triplet); breaking grammatical units across line endings ("enjambment") so that not every line ending also finishes off a sentence or a clause; relatedly, varying the length of sentences and clauses; and so on.</p>
<p>Contrariwise, using enjambment too often can cause the reader or listener to lose track of the overriding rhythm of the verse, so that the poem starts to sound like prose. This is less of a danger in poems that feature end-rhyme - which comprise about 98% of metrical poetry in English - but can loom large in long stretches of blank verse; for instance, this is not infrequently my experience when reading Milton's <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> - something noted long ago, apparently, by Samuel Johnson. One mitigation I'm considering is ending every small section of 10-20 lines with a rhyming couplet, as well as not overdoing the use of enjambment.</p>
<p>Intelligent use of varying word lengths can add rhythmic interest: monosyllabic words are typically read more slowly and deliberately, whereas polysyllabic words flow along more quickly. On this point, consider these successive lines that Steele adduces from Shakespeare's <cite>Hamlet</cite>: "Absent thee from felicity awhile / And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain."</p>
<p>Although intuitively we might expect that rhymed verse would be more bombastic because the poet needs to continually chime those line endings, Steele observes that, if not handled skillfully, it's blank verse that tends toward "rhetorical excess"; prime causes are the frequent use of enjambment and syntactically complex sentences that flow across multiple lines. I suspect that additional factors might include the subject matter (much blank verse is found in epic poetry) and historical precedent (few poets are more high-flown than the likes of Homer, Virgil, and Dante).</p>
<p>If I do get serious about composing a "Pyrrhiad", these are definitely considerations I'll keep in mind.</p>

<h2><a href="1879.html">Pyrrhiad</a></h2>
<h3>2024-07-09</h3>
<p>For some time now I've toyed with the idea of writing a novel (provisionally entitled <cite>Gods Among Men</cite>) about Alexander the Great and the founder of philosophical skepticism, Pyrrho. Having recently re-read both the <cite>Iliad</cite> and the <cite>Odyssey</cite>, I'm wondering if I could structure the story as an epic poem, almost as if it were translated from the work of an ancient Greek poet deeply influenced by Homer. Here's a draft of the standard invocation of the muse to start things off:</p>
<blockquote>
Sing me, muse, of two men who lived as gods.<br>
So many were the lands through which they passed,<br>
So many were the minds from which they learned<br>
While, by the one man seeking to rule all<br>
And by the other reaching out to know,<br>
They travelled far from Greece to India.<br>
First Alexander, King of Makedōn,<br>
Whose fame will last as long as men shall live:<br>
Just as a huge wave crashes on the shore<br>
And smashes all before it when the earth<br>
Afar is shaken by Poseidon's rage,<br>
So Alexander broke upon the East,<br>
Forever changing all within his wake.<br>
Then second, sing me, too, of one who lived<br>
Unknown, yet rivalled Zeus for happiness:<br>
Although he conquered nothing in his path,<br>
His path led him to conquering within,<br>
To mastery of no one but himself;<br>
For wisdom brought him deep serenity.<br>
From Elis, the Epeians' land, he came;<br>
Son of Pleistarchos, Pyrrho was his name.<br>
<br>
O muse, come be my ally, for I doubt<br>
The texture of the tale I dare to tell:<br>
Its warp and woof are lost within the past,<br>
Beyond recovery, uncertain, dim;<br>
At this late date the details cannot be<br>
Defined with clarity; so, uninclined<br>
To this interpretation or to that,<br>
I flow within the stream of what has been<br>
And joy to tell the story of a world<br>
That had such giants in it, long ago.<br>
Dread goddess, Zeus' daughter, let us start<br>
When Pyrrho in his youth took mind to heart...<br>

<h2><a href="1878.html">Walking with Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics IV.1-2</a></h2>
<h3>2024-07-08</h3>
<p>Next Aristotle turns to generosity. A more literal rendering of the Greek word ἐλευθεριότης might be "free-giving", since it is derived from ἐλευθερία, the Greek word for freedom. We'll talk more about freedom farther along in our walk with Aristotle, but for now it's worth noting that Aristotle's conception of freedom is not purely political but also includes personal aspects of character, behavior, and thinking.</p>
<p>The paradigmatic sense of generosity is giving - and, interestingly, earning - money in appropriate ways. (Presumably in an extended sense we could speak of being generous with one's time or attention or other resources, but we'll leave that for another day.) The two opposites of generosity - both falling short and going too far of what's beautifully right in this domain - are stinginess and wastefulness: the stingy person thinks money is a more serious matter than it really is, whereas the wasteful person doesn't take it seriously enough and thus might not have enough to live on, which is self-destructive.</p>
<p>Aristotle introduces two key principles in Chapter I:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For anything that has a use, the ethically thriving person will use it best. This applies to money (the generous person gives well), but also to things like skill, strength, status, and power.</li>
  <li>It's better to give than to receive - or, more generally, to be active than to be acted upon.</li>
</ul>
<p>A further wrinkle is that for Aristotle, giving is personal (the ancient Greeks didn't have non-profit foundations, so generosity was one-to-one). The character of the recipient matters a great deal. A wasteful person doesn't necessarily give too great an amount, but might give to the wrong kind of person, such as a sycophant or someone who brings pleasure in unwholesome ways.</p>
<p>Similar considerations apply to getting or earning money. Here <em>you</em> are the recipient, and your character matters, too: Aristotle observes that it doesn't befit a free person to engage in shameful lines of work (his examples are pimps and loan sharks). This insight might prove helpful later on when we consider Aristotle's discussion of leisure (σχολή).</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, Aristotle talks about a special flavor of generosity he calls magnificence, which applies only to people of great wealth - the kind of public benefactors who could fittingly fund a dramatic festival, a diplomatic delegation, or a warship (in classical Greece such things were paid for by the rich individually, not through general taxation). The magnificent person knows how to spend money on a grand scale without being gaudy or chintzy; what's beautifully right about this rather specialized excellence of character is its sense of grandeur (μέγεθος).</p>
<p>In this respect, Chapter 2 on magnificence (μεγαλοπρεπεία) serves as a segue to Chapter 3 on greatness of soul (μεγαλοψυχία). That's a topic fraught with controversy, which is why I'll cover it separately in the next stage of our Aristotelian journey.</p>

<h3>2024-07-02</h3>
<p>After his discussion of courage, Aristotle moves immediately to another of the traditional four virtues in ancient Greece: moderation. Although Aristotle never said that we should pursue moderation in everything, he did think that moderation is crucial to human fulfillment. Among other considerations, courage is paradigmatically displayed in war, but we engage in war only for the sake of peace; thus we need to understand and practice the character traits that maintain peace, among which moderation plays a central role.</p>
<p>The Greek word rendered here as 'moderation' is σωφροσύνη, which is notoriously difficult to translate (there's a whole book on the topic by Helen North, which of course I've read in my copious research into Aristotle's ethics). Following his usual procedure of attempting to identify the primary cases, Aristotle settles on situations in which human beings are drawn to bodily pleasures that we have in common with other animals, especially those that involve the senses of taste or touch. As he says, we don't call someone immoderate or decadent (ἀκόλαστος) if they have a passion for listening to music or viewing beautiful artworks, but we do if they are overly attached to eating, drinking, or sex. Similar reasoning applies to, say, a passion for honor or for learning; in such domains, the enjoyment is more mental than physical.</p>
<p>As with all character traits, the thriving or excellence lies somewhere between behaviors that fall short and those that go too far: here, moderation is intermediate between an admittedly rare insensitivity to bodily pleasures and an all-too-human tendency to indulgence. We are naturally geared to seek pleasure, which is why leading a more moderate, temperate life is a positive achievement. That life consists in feeling and acting in ways that are consistent with bodily health, good physical condition, reasonable expense, and - as always - that aim at what is beautifully right.</p>
<p>By contrast, the person who succumbs to decadence essentially has a policy of greedily grabbing every pleasure that comes his way (even if they are repulsively wrong) and is downright pained by a lack of constant titillation. In this fashion, the decadent person destroys the harmony that should naturally obtain between reason and desire - he literally loses his mind, since etymologically sōphrosunē means to preserve one's capacity to think and be mindful.</p>
<p>Both courage and moderation deal fundamentally with enjoyable and distressful emotions: fear and hope in the case of courage, bodily gratification in the case of moderation. From here, in Book IV Aristotle will progress to excellences of character that focus primarily on admirably appropriate actions, such as generosity and kindness. We'll look at those in our next installment of walking with Aristotle.</p>

<h2><a href="1876.html">Varieties of Courage</a></h2>
<h3>2024-06-23</h3>
<p>In my post the other day about Aristotle's discussion of courage, I neglected to mention the restricted reference of his definition: roughly speaking, he says that the character trait of courage enables you to feel the appropriate level of fear and confidence when confronted with the possibility of dying in battle. It's true that he does mention other varieties of courage, since you can be brave when you might lose anything you hold valuable, such as your health (e.g., when diagnosed with a dread disease) or social status (e.g., when speaking out against injustice); yet he says that these varieties are merely analogous to the core or "focal" sense of the term.</p>
<p>We moderns can find this approach disconcerting, for we often try to formulate the most comprehensive definition covering the widest range of cases. By contrast, Aristotle usually works to identify the primary instance of a phenomenon, and then treats all the other instances as analogous to the paradigm. In practice this might be a distinction without a difference, but it's important to keep it in mind as we work our way through Aristotle's <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>.</p>

<p>The first thriving of character that Aristotle discusses at length is courage. Why?</p>
<p>To start with, we mustn't forget the cultural and historical context: that of small city-states plagued by endemic warfare (e.g., Athens and Megara, 40km apart, were in conflict on and off for centuries). For good reason, the Greek word ἀνδρεία means both courage and manliness: if the menfolk did not demonstrate bravery in battle, a town could be destroyed, with the men likely killed and the women and children sold into slavery. For the ancients, courage was serious business.</p>
<p>More fundamentally, courage illustrates a number key points that Aristotle wishes to make about human character:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Because it is possible not only to fall short of "hitting the target" in human behavior but also to overshoot it, an excellence of character has not one opposite, but two. For instance, courage is opposed not only to cowardice but also to rashness.</li>
  <li>Human beings thrive not only in their actions but also in their feelings and emotions. For instance, true courage isn't merely a matter of acting bravely but also of experiencing the right amounts of fear and confidence in threatening situations. Indeed, the courageous person faces even the risk of a noble death with a feeling of tranquility, at least within human limits (there are certain dangers that no one should be expected to face without disturbance).</li>
  <li>Behaviors come with reasons and thoughts and accounts attached, and those matter. For instance, it's not true courage if you appear to act bravely merely because you want to avoid a court-martial, or because you're forced to do so, or because you're so experienced that nothing fazes you, or because you're naturally high-spirited, or because you have unrealistic levels of self-confidence, or because you're totally oblivious to the dangers you face.</li>
  <li>The correct reason or thought or account (ὀρθός λόγος) for an action-plus-feeling is that it is the beautifully right (καλός) thing to do, or that not to do it would be repulsively wrong (αἰσχρός). Yes, these phrases are charged with ethical and aesthetic significance, because that's how Aristotle sees the realm of human affairs.</li>
  <li>For the person of good character who takes life seriously (and who by that very fact has strong reasons for loving their own existence), the prospect of losing their life in battle is far from pleasant; yet even this can be enjoyable <em>in a way</em>, if one is committed to and stays focused on the purpose or completion (τέλος) of the activity (ἐνέργεια), i.e., on doing what is beautifully right.</li>
  <li>The purpose or completion of an activity is directed by the relevant character trait (κατὰ τὴν ἕξιν), which means it is also directed by the commitments and thought processes underlying that trait, since (as we will see in Book VI) it is not possible to be completely good without also having attained some measure of wisdom (φρόνησις). Moreover, acquiring a trait involves not only wisdom but also deep commitment (προαίρεσις) and, as he says at the end of III.2, "commitment is accompanied by an account (μετὰ λόγου) and by thinking things through (διάνοια)".</li>
</ul>
<p>That's a lot to squeeze into three short chapters! We'll see Aristotle build upon these insights as he works his way through the other virtues, starting in III.10-12 with moderation.</p>
