<h2><a href="1924.html">Taking Notes</a></h2>
<h3>2024-11-26</h3>
<p>Since I seem to be on a roll writing about habits, I figured I'd mention another one: taking notes during meetings.</p>
<p>Over the last five years of my tech career, I got really good at this. It started when I used to volunteer as a scribe during industry standardization meetings at the IETF, wherein I would jot down the main discussion points and action items so that the working group chairs could provide a session summary to the conference proceedings. Over time, I started doing the same thing in my day job - especially at Mozilla, where I had a huge number of meetings with partners and it became difficult to keep track of it all.</p>
<p>Initially I did this in paper notebooks, but that method had a few major downsides. First, the resulting notes weren't searchable. Second, I can type way faster than I can write. My solution was to keep all my notes in text files on my computer, which I could search through using the `grep` utility at the Unix command line. (Yes, I'm a geek - more normal folks might use a dedicated note-taking app.) For each meeting, I would create a separate file named `partner-yyyy-mm-dd.txt`, thus making it easy to see the entire history of interactions. For each meeting, I would list the participants, write up major discussion points and decisions, list action items (prefaced by "TODO" for improved searchability). If I had time, I would quickly review and correct the notes after the meeting; if I had back-to-back meetings, as was often the case, I would try to do this at the end of the day while my memories were still fresh.</p>
<p>For our most important partners, we kept notes in shared documents, which was good for transparency and collaborative note-taking but more distracting for me because I find it convenient to type in a small terminal window tucked away in the bottom right corner of the screen while most of the screen is devoted to the video conferencing app where the meeting takes place.</p>
<p>Speaking of distracting, you might wonder: doesn't it annoy other participants if I'm typing away during a meeting? I'm a fairly noisy typist, but I've learned to type more quietly and I also mute myself when not speaking (here it helps to have a corded headset with a physical mute button).</p>
<p>Taking notes in this way really helped me to stay organized, follow through on my commitments, and communicate more effectively. If you give it a try, let me know how it goes.</p>

<h2><a href="1923.html">Good Distractions</a></h2>
<h3>2024-11-25</h3>
<p>While talking with a friend today, I described my concept of the "to don't list" as well as a few of my personal best practices related to smartphone usage. In the midst of our conversation, it occurred to me that there's such a thing as a good distraction. It's difficult for even the most disciplined person to stay focused all the time on long-term projects and personal productivity. We all need a mental break! Yet, speaking from experience, all too often I'm wont to pull out my smartphone or computer and check the headlines, even though I've been on a low-information diet for 10-15 years and intellectually I know the news isn't helpful for my state of mind. At least for me, this a bad distraction!</p>
<p>By contrast, for me good distractions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Picking up my guitar to play a song or work my way through a few more measures of a piece I'm learning (currently that's the Trois Gymnop√©dies of Erik Satie).</li>
<li>Stepping outside to stretch my legs and walk the dogs.</li>
<li>Reading a poem or two (preferably in a book because the ideal distraction happens in the real world, but failing that at my Monadnock website).</li>
<li>Taking a photo of cloud formations and sending it to my friend Paul.</li>
<li>Checking the liner notes of whatever recording I'm listening to.</li>
<li>Leafing through an art book to soak in a few paintings.</li>
<li>Watching the birds at our bird feeder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thinking about what makes for good distractions will, I suspect, cause me to be even more intentional about seeking them out, thus solidifying the practice.</p>
<p>As another friend of mine likes to say: "Good habits are hard to break." True - but it's forming them in the first place that's the challenge! ;-)</p>

<h2><a href="1922.html">Powerless</a></h2>
<h3>2024-11-24</h3>
<p>Several friends I've talked with recently have expressed despair over the results of the recent U.S. elections, disbelief over Donald Trump's picks for cabinet roles, even a desire to move to Canada or Europe - plus a kind of wonder that I'm able to maintain my equanimity in what they see as a dire situation. In case it might prove helpful to other folks, I'll try to describe my mindset.</p>
<p>First, I tend not to catastrophize because it seems to me that human beings have a nearly endless capacity for muddling through, adjusting to new circumstances, counteracting overreach, etc.</p>
<p>Second, I doubt that we are precisely situated at the crossroads of history or that we are facing an unprecedented Emergency Disaster Crisis of epic proportions. Let's not overstate our own importance. (And yes, I do hear the cries of "this time it really is different!")</p>
<p>Third, I've read enough about American history to understand that we have always had many strands of political thought in this country, and that out of these many strands a stronger (if always somewhat fractious) union has been weaved over the centuries. E Pluribus Unum.</p>
<p>Fourth, representative democracy in America (despite its faults and our inability so far to fully live up to our founding ideals) has existed for 400 years, at every level of government: one nation, 50 states, 3000+ counties, tens of thousands of cities and towns with their councils and boards and all the rest. I believe this culture of self-governance is more robust than some people fear.</p>
<p>Fifth and finally, I recognize that I have absolutely no power or influence over the ship of state. That is certainly the case at the national level: I am only one of ~340,000,000 people in the USA, I have neither sought nor gained any role in government or politics, I don't have the ear of any influential people, I'm not a so-called public intellectual, etc. The same is true here in Colorado (where I'm only one of ~6,000,000 people), in Douglas County (where I'm only one of ~400,000 people), etc. In my neighborhood of ~200 households I do run our website and serve on the board of our civic association, so here I'm able to have something of a positive impact, but in general I'm just as powerless as almost everyone else in this country.</p>
<p>The difference, perhaps, is this: I accept that I'm powerless. Over the years, I have tried to rid myself of political delusions. I don't see myself as a member of Team Blue or Team Red or any other team, because unless you're especially active in retail politics (which I'm not) then you're not really a member of a team - you're merely rooting from a seat in the bleachers. I don't kid myself that my "one small voice" of a weblog is a soapbox of any significance. I don't believe, against all evidence to the contrary, that my political opinions matter to anyone but me, or that expressing them will be anything but a source of frustration to myself and annoyance to others. And so on.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, understanding and accepting that I'm powerless is, if not exactly empowering, at least liberating. For all I know, the day-to-day machinations of powerful people in Washington, D.C. or my state capitol might as well be happening in a parallel universe. Yes, journalists and pundits have an unwelcome habit of reporting and commenting on this parallel universe as if it were the most important thing in the world, but for the most part I can ignore them and their delusions of grandeur, too.</p>
<p>What I'm left with are the aspects of life that are somewhat within my span of influence and control: my family, friendships, neighborhood, projects, activities, etc. That's quite enough to focus on without fretting about the things I cannot change.</p>
<p>Naturally, what works for me won't necessarily work for you. YMMV.</p>

<h2><a href="1921.html">Simplicity</a></h2>
<h3>2024-11-18</h3>
<p>Not long ago I ran across a wonderful quote from Fr√©d√©ric Chopin:</p>
<blockquote>Simplicity is the final achievement. After one has played a vast quantity of notes and more notes, it is simplicity that emerges as the crowning reward of art.</blockquote>
<p>Ironically, I tend to associate Chopin's music with "a vast quantity of notes"; to find simplicity, I would seek out, say, the music of Erik Satie, whose <cite>Trois Gymnop√©dies</cite> I've been re-learning on guitar of late.</p>
<p>Or, as is written in chapter 56 of the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
Those who know don't say<br>
Those who say don't know
</blockquote>
<p>And, of course, Thoreau, who in <cite>Walden</cite> urged us to "simplify, simplify."</p>
<p>Pondering the matter makes me want to contemplate more and write less...</p>

<h2><a href="1920.html">Walking with Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics X.9</a></h2>
<h3>2024-11-11</h3>
<p>Here at the very end of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>, after tens of thousands of words about human fulfillment, Aristotle somewhat wryly observes that words are powerless to encourage most people to understand and enact what is good and beautifully right, for they live by their feelings and respond more readily to correction and punishment than to wisdom and insight.</p>
<p>So who is the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> for? As he said in the beginning and reiterates here, it's for people of good character who have been raised well and already love what's beautifully right, but need to understand and practice it even more fully. This is especially important in our interactions with other people individually (thus Aristotle's major focus on love and friendship) and in society (where brotherhood is even more valuable than justice). This last topic leads Aristotle to end the <cite>Ethics</cite> by introducing politics as the crowning achievement and completion of the philosophic study of human affairs. So even though in X.6-8 he seems to have claimed that the best life is contemplative or a life of inquiry, immediately he brings things back to earth by reinforcing the centrality of sociality in human existence.</p>
<p>Although it might therefore seem that ethics is merely the handmaiden of politics, those who have read Aristotle's <cite>Politics</cite> know he ends that work by deeply considering the central role of education in the health of the community. Yet it's little noted by scholars that Aristotle makes a similar argument at the conclusion of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>. Because character is so dependent on a good upbringing, early learning about the truly human way of life is key. Yet he says that we must maintain these beautifully right doings and feelings as adults, too, by practicing and applying what we've learned and enculturating [·ºêŒ∏ŒØŒ∂ŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ / ethizesthai] ourselves to the highest possibilities of human existence.  This kind of ethical education needs to be tailored to each person since the applications of what we learn are more precise when the practices are individualized [·º∞Œ¥ŒØŒ± / idia]. Only after achieving this kind of ethical improvement is it appropriate for someone who wants to gain greater skill and awareness in ethical understanding [·ºêœÄŒπœÉœÑŒÆŒºŒ∑ / episteme] to proceed to the study of ethical universals, since that enables such a person to give the kind of care [·ºêœÄŒπŒºŒµŒªŒµŒØŒ± / epimeleia] that can help others (friends, family, students, etc.) to become better people.</p>
<p>These musings, rarely remarked upon by ancient philosophy scholars, indicate to me that Aristotle saw himself as offering just this kind of care to the people in his own life and even to those who would read his writings after his passing. This hunch is reinforced by the fact that he immediately goes on to criticize the sophists of his day, who professed to know and teach how to improve their paying students and society at large but who didn't practice what they preached. For Aristotle, the deception [·ºÄœÄŒ¨œÑŒ∑ / apatƒì] involved in sophistry is the very opposite of sagacity [œÉŒøœÜŒØŒ± / sophia], for the sophist lacks a commitment to truth whereas the sagacious person is dedicated above all to œÜŒπŒªŒøœÉŒøœÜŒØŒ± / philosophy as the love of wisdom and the search for truth, not only in theoretical inquiry but in practical experience. By reading this passage - and the whole of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> - with care and attention, we come to see that Aristotle was deeply committed to philosophy as a way of life, just as Plato and Socrates were before him.</p>
<p>This journal entry marks the end of our walk through the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>. For the convience of future readers, I've reformatted this series of thirty posts into a standalone guide that I'll continue to update over time. And although I plan to go on a few more intellectual journeys with Aristotle (starting with his <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite>), I've decided not to blog about those since in-depth analysis of Aristotelian texts might not be of general interest. I'll soon return to my regular schedule of philosophical reflections.</p>

<h2><a href="1919.html">Walking with Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics X.6-8</a></h2>
<h3>2024-11-09</h3>
<p>In these rather dense chapters, the last of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> except for X.9, Aristotle returns to the topic of human fulfillment [Œµ·ΩêŒ¥Œ±ŒπŒºŒøŒΩŒØŒ± / eudaimonia], drawing several conclusions that sound surprising to modern ears:</p>
<ul>
<li>That complete fulfillment is an activity of conceptual awareness [Œ∏ŒµœâœÅŒØŒ± / theoria].</li>
<li>That the sagacious person [œÉŒøœÜœåœÇ / sophos] experiences the greatest fulfillment in life.</li>
<li>That the way of life [Œ≤ŒØŒøœÇ / bios] directed by intellectual insight [Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ŒΩŒø·ø¶ŒΩ / kata tƒìn noun] and conceptual awareness [Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ Œ∏ŒµœâœÅŒØŒ±ŒΩ / kata tƒìn theorian] is the best and most enjoyable life of all.</li>
<li>That the way of life directed by excellence of character [Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ·ºÄœÅŒµœÑŒÆŒΩ / kata tƒìn aretƒìn] also counts as fulfillment, but in a secondary way [Œ¥ŒµœÖœÑŒ≠œÅœâœÇ / deuter≈çs].</li>
</ul>
<p>Ancient philosophy scholars usually interpret these chapters as a straightforward argument for <em>their</em> way of life, but I'm somewhat skeptical about that. Much hinges on our reading of the term Œ∏ŒµœâœÅŒØŒ± / theoria, which is usually translated as contemplation but which I render as conceptual awareness to distinguish it from the perceptual awareness [·ºÑŒπœÉŒ∏Œ∑œÉŒπœÇ / aisthesis] that humans share with non-human animals. Another big question is whether the little preposition Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ should be read in a restrictive sense (<em>only</em> the activities of intellectual insight and conceptual awareness are necessary and sufficient for complete fulfillment) or, as I would, in a directive sense (the best and most enjoyable way of life needs to be <em>guided</em> by intellectual insight and conceptual awareness). Finally, as we saw in VI.6-8, I maintain that sagacity [œÉŒøœÜŒØŒ± / sophia] is not limited to understanding of and insight into topics like mathematics and astronomy but includes the biological sciences and the foundations of human action, since the core aspects of human nature are unchanging.</p>
<p>If we put these things together, we end up with an argument not for a passive life of pure contemplation untouched by human concerns, but for the <em>examined life</em>. That's how I see it, anyway - I'll provide a more in-depth treatment of the matter in my forthcoming book <cite>Complete Thyself: Aristotle on Human Fulfillment</cite>.</p>
