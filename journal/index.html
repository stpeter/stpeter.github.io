<h2><a href="1836.html">Ancient Friends</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-10</h3>
<p>On this day 510 years ago (December 10th, 1513), Niccolò Machiavelli wrote a now-famous letter to his friend Francesco Vettori about his life in exile from Florence - and about a little book he was writing, which has come down to us as <cite>The Prince</cite>. After relating what had happened that day on his farm and in the village, he described his evening routine, when he would "visit" with Plutarch, Polybius, Livy, Aristotle, and other great minds of antiquity:</p>
<blockquote>
When evening has come, I return to my house and go into my study. At the door I take off my clothes of the day, covered with mud and mire, and I put on my regal and courtly garments; and decently reclothed, I enter the ancient courts of ancient men, where, received by them lovingly, I feed on the food that alone is mine and that I was born for. There I am not ashamed to speak with them and to ask them the reason for their actions; and they in their humanity reply to me. And for the space of four hours I feel no boredom, I forget every pain, I do not fear poverty, death does not frighten me. I deliver myself entirely to them. And because Dante says that to have understood without retaining does not make knowledge, I have noted what capital I have made from their conversation and have composed a little work <cite>De Principatibus</cite>, where I delve as deeply as I can into reflections on this subject, debating what a principality is, of what kinds they are, how they are acquired, how they are maintained, why they are lost.
</blockquote>
<p>I love the image of Machiavelli's ancient friends, who receive him lovingly and converse with him in their great-hearted humanity. It reminds me of something that Nietzsche wrote in <cite>Human, All Too Human</cite>, which I quoted once before in a blog post about Aristotle and Thoreau over twenty years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
I, too, have been in the underworld, like Odysseus, and will often be there again; and I have not only sacrificed rams to be able to talk with the dead, but have not spared my own blood as well. There have been four pairs who did not refuse themselves to me, the sacrificer: Epicurus and Montaigne, Goethe and Spinoza, Plato and Rousseau, Pascal and Schopenhauer. With these I have had to come to terms when I have wandered long alone, from them will I accept judgment, to them will I listen when in doing so they judge one another. Whatever I say, resolve, cogitate for myself and others: upon these eight I fix my eyes and see theirs fixed upon me.
</blockquote>
<p>I, too, might have such pairs: Aristotle and Thoreau, Nietzsche and Epicurus, Plato and Rand, Spinoza and Montaigne are the ones that come immediately to mind, at least in philosophy (I can think of others in the realms of poetry and literature). It's a rare and good thing to have such friends.</p>

<h2><a href="1835.html">Reality is Messy</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-09</h3>
<p>The usually reasonable Arnold Kling, one of my favorite bloggers going back 25 years, has been using ChatGPT to build an essay-grading app and might have taken one too many sips of the Kool-Aid. Consider:</p>
<blockquote>Imagine what will happen when these AIs are connected to physical tools. These physical tools might be custom robots or all-purpose robots. You could be a farmer who never has to go into the fields — just explain to the robots what you want. Or you could be a chef who gives directions without being in the kitchen. Or a scientist who conducts experiments without having to spend all day in the lab.</blockquote>
<p>Let's extend that further. You could be a sailor who never needs to step foot on a boat; or a composer who never needs to touch a piano; or an artist who never needs to pick up a brush; or a friend who never needs to meet for coffee; or a spouse who never needs to help around the house; or a parent who never needs to take your ("the"?) kid to the playground. Get the AI robots to deal with messy realities while you sit in the metaverse telling them what to do! (Ignoring the fact that you won't know what commands to issue unless you have some experience and understanding of those messy realities in the first place.)</p>
<p>Is this a world that any sane human being wants to live in? Is this the path to greater human wisdom and fulfillment?</p>
<p>We are physical beings and embodied selves, not disembodied minds. Sure, reality is messy, but that's where learning and flourishing happen: in going into the fields, experimenting in the lab or the kitchen, feeling the wind in your face, doodling at the piano, mixing paints, venturing out for coffee, working side by side with your partner, holding your child's hand. These fantasies of transcending our bodies and our physical interactions are so deeply misguided that it's hard to know where to start in critiquing them, other than to feel sorry for those who indulge in them. (To be fair, I don't think Kling is one of them because he often writes about the inherent pleasures of activities like grandparenting and Israeli dancing, I just think he got carried away.)</p>

<h2><a href="1834.html">An Aristotelian Glossary</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-06</h3>
<p>Of late I've been working on the first serious contribution to my forthcoming book about Aristotle's conception of human fulfillment: a glossary of key terms. Those curious enough to peruse it will quickly discover that some of my renderings are rather non-standard. In my defense, usually these translations are rooted in ancient Greek etymology and usage or modern academic scholarship (e.g., both Aryeh Kosman and Myles Burnyeat recommended "understanding" instead of "knowledge" for <em>epistēmē</em>, as noted in my recent post "Understanding What You Know"); however, in a few instances I go farther out on a limb (e.g., "thriving" instead of "virtue" for <em>aretē</em> and, most centrally of all, "fulfillment" instead of "happiness" for <em>eudaimonia</em>). Although all of these renderings are subject to change, I'm quite satisfied with them so far (having pondered them for years) and in fact they provide a good indication of the interpretive direction I'm taking.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h2><a href="1833.html">Understanding What You Know</a></h2>
<h3>2023-11-29</h3>
<p>Recently I discovered two ancient philosophy papers from the 1970s (by Aryeh Kosman and Myles Burnyeat) drawing a distinction between knowledge and understanding. As far as I can tell, Kosman was the first to propose that the Greek word epistēmē is best translated as understanding, and that in fact it means understanding how to explain what you know, in other words understanding why the thing you know is the way it is.</p>
<p>Without delving into their interpretations of Aristotle's <cite>Posterior Analytics</cite>, I must say that this distinction strikes a chord with me. Consider a simple example: we all know that trees shed their leaves in autumn, at least in certain parts of the world. But it's an entirely different matter to understand and explain why that is the case, since doing so requires an understanding of all the botanical, environmental, chemical (etc.) factors responsible for the fall of the leaves.</p>
<p>Now extend this model to something much more complicated: say, the role of self-knowledge in human fulfillment. Ever since the saying "Know Thyself" was first inscribed on the walls of the temple at Delphi 2500+ years ago, everyone has <em>known</em> that the phrase contains great wisdom. Yet it's the task of a lifetime to deeply <em>understand</em> those two little words and integrate them with everything you know about psychological development, individual maturation, the virtues, human relationships, and so on - both in theory and in your own practice of living.</p>
<p>Knowledge is relatively easy; understanding is really, really hard.</p>

<h2><a href="1832.html">Economic Gratitude</a></h2>
<h3>2023-11-27</h3>
<p>Over the last few months I've been tutoring a Ukrainian mom in English as a Second Language through my local library. Several weeks ago she asked me how Americans navigate the world of saving and investment, so I sent her links to one or two of my own blog posts as well as a number of more professional resources. We also had an hourlong discussion about the economic and legal infrastructure for investment that exists in America: stock markets, mutual funds, ETFs, Treasury bills, federal and municipal bonds, REITs, precious metals, commodities, futures markets, 401(k) plans, IRAs, 529 accounts, and all the rest. Folks in the Ukraine and many other countries around the world simply don't have (relatively) trusted investment vehicles like this; in all likelihood, their primary investment method is putting cash under the pillow. We don't realize how fortunate we are to have so many ways to build wealth.</p>

<h2><a href="1831.html">The Primacy of the Prompt</a></h2>
<h3>2023-11-16</h3>
<p>While re-reading Robert Sokolowski's excellent book <cite>Phenomenology of the Human Person</cite> recently, I came across a fascinating quote from Derek Bickerton's book <cite>Language and Human Behavior</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
The problems animals solve, the problems we solve, are our <em>own</em> problems.... But the problems computers solve are not problems for computers. If I have a problem, it's my problem. If my computer has a problem, it's still my problem. Nothing is a problem for it, because it doesn't interact with the world. It just sits there and waits for me to give it <em>my</em> problems.
</blockquote>
<p>This is why LLMs like ChatGPT have a prompt. The LLM doesn't figuratively or literally walk into my office and say "hey, I've been thinking about this problem I've got and I'd like to bounce around some potential solutions with you"; in the terms I introduced a few weeks ago, the LLM isn't <em>sentient</em> because nothing is <em>salient</em> for it. For this reason, in contrast with folks who are excited about the prospect of artificial intelligence, I find these systems to be fundamentally boring.</p>
