<h2><a href="1781.html">Open Reading Interview</a></h2>
<h3>2023-05-11</h3>
<p>Three weeks ago I had the honor of being interviewed by Sal Inglima of Boston Free Radio for his Open Readings show. We had a great time talking about the fine art of poetry translation. Sal read aloud my translation of a German poem about the eve of World War II by philosopher Walter Kaufmann and I read my translation of Sappho fragment 16 as well as two of my own poems: Ancient Fire (from the eponymous collection) and Brief Wisdom (from <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite>). Enjoy!</p>

<h2><a href="1780.html">What Philosophers Do</a></h2>
<h3>2023-05-11</h3>
<p>If philosophy is a way of life, then what are the characteristic activities of philosophers? (I mean, of course, not professors of philosophy, but people who love and practice the minerval arts of wisdom.)</p>
<p>As far as I know, there is surprisingly little written on this topic, even by Pierre Hadot, who resurrected the ancient conception of philosophy as a way of life about 40 years ago. Sure, Socrates harangued his fellow Athenians in the agora, Confucius traveled around the fragmented states of ancient China encouraging various kings and princes to rule benevolently, the Buddha found enlightenment while mediating under the bodhi tree, Thoreau built a little house by the shores of Walden Pond and rambled around the Concord countryside, Spinoza got excommunicated for heretical thinking and ground lenses for a living, and so on.</p>
<p>Even right there we have quite the diversity in ways of life. As to more theoretical or academic activities, many philosophers wrote down their thoughts for future generations, but others, such as Socrates and Epictetus, wrote not a word. Some, like Plato, started a school where they gathered students and disciples; some, like Epicurus, formed intentional communities; but others, like Nietzsche and Spinoza, lived in relative solitude. Some, like Chu Hsi, were bookish scholars; others were more interested in directly fronting the essential facts of life, as Thoreau put it.</p>
<p>Yet underneath it all, I see this: a philosopher engages in deep and serious reflection about being human, and uses those reflections as the firm foundation for living deliberately and doing consistently what is beautifully right. Indeed, a philosopher takes life and wisdom so seriously that he or she holds as an ideal a lifetime of striving to become a great human being and a noble sage.</p>
<p>These formulations contain many concepts that are quite rarified, admittedly aspirational, and even untimely: reflection, deliberation, depth, seriousness, wisdom, beauty, rightness, greatness, humanity, nobility, sagehood. That strikes me as unavoidable, for, as Spinoza observed, all things excellent are as difficult as they are rare.</p>
<p>If this be idealism, make the most of it.</p>

<h2><a href="1779.html">Much Ado about Nothingness</a></h2>
<h3>2023-05-04</h3>
<p>In pursuit of wisdom, I often explore intellectual traditions I'm not familiar with. Most recently, I've been reading a sourcebook of Japanese philosophy, in which I found a fascinating essay by Abe Masao (1915-2006) on the Buddhist concept of emptiness or nothingness.</p>
<p>Abe's foil here is Plato. In Plato's dialogue <cite>Parmenides</cite>, Socrates argues that there must be an ultimate reality behind the unstable flux of human experience - specifically, unchanging archetypes called Forms that are located in some other dimension of existence. With due respect to Plato, Abe maintains that there is no such ultimate reality: the only world we have is the world of experience, behind which there is absolute emptiness or nothingness.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, Buddhism holds that there is no ultimate reality - no unchanging, individual True Self - behind our inner experience, either. Instead, the "original nature" or "buddha nature" is a potential that all human beings can live up to with enough practice (or, given the Buddhist doctrine of reincarnation, enough lifetimes).</p>
<p>Through his opposition to the concept of an ultimate reality, Abe seems to propose a kind of positive emptiness: not a nothingness of despair as in existentialism or fatalism, but a clearing away of the conceptual and emotional underbrush so that we can minimize our attachment to false notions and expectations. Only by doing so can we open ourselves up to fulfilling our highest human potential. Indeed, because Aristotle held that the self is an achievement, Aristotle and the Buddha might not have been very far apart on this issue, which might be a bit of a surprise!</p>

<h2><a href="1778.html">The Determinist Fantasy</a></h2>
<h3>2023-04-27</h3>
<p>Determinism - the belief that all events (including animal behavior and human actions) are fixed or ordained by antecedent conditions or external forces before they happen - doesn't keep me up at night, but it seems to be something of a bogeyman for many people. To my mind, it's a fantastical notion. Here's how I perceive the argument for this belief:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Every event in the universe, no matter how complex, could be explained by a perfectly complete set of natural laws.</li>
  <li>All natural laws could be predictive with complete precision and complete accuracy.</li>
  <li>It is possible that an all-knowing entity (god, demon, computer, whatever) could possess (a) complete knowledge of all natural laws and (b) complete information about the condition of the universe at a particular time.</li>
  <li>This entity would be able to predict all subsequent events in the universe.</li>
  <li>The predictive success of this entity would demonstrate that all events are strictly determined by previous conditions.</li>
  <li>Therefore determinism is true.</li>
</ol>
<p>One could provide many sophisticated philosophical arguments against the determinist fantasy, involving GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorem, the epistemology of explanation and prediction, the nature of time, etc. Because I like to keep things short and sweet, instead I'll use a homely example: the honeybee.</p>
<p>What would our all-knowing entity need to know in order to precisely and accurately predict every event in the life a single honeybee? And I do mean every: its exact lifespan, its exact physiological activity at every moment, exactly how many times each day it flies out of the hive for pollen, its exact flight paths, exactly which flowers it visits and for how long, exactly what messages it exchanges with its hivemates, exactly what obstacles and conditions it experiences and exactly how it reacts, and so on. Even if the bee never flies more than a mile from the hive and the hive contains only one hundred bees and there are only a thousand flowers within a one-mile radius (of course these things change with the seasons and the weather and the passage of time), the possible event-trees for prediction purposes must number in the trillions or more.</p>
<p>And that's just one little honeybee! Consider that, even in that one square mile of earth, we'd need to multiply by a hundred of bees in the hive, a thousand flowers, thousands of other insects, hundreds of birds and quadrupeds and bushes and trees, hundreds of thousands of blades of grass, and so on - not to mention the exact composition and condition of the soil and the constantly moving and changing air (including every weather event), etc. Oh, and let's multiply all that by hundreds of millions of square miles of the earth's surface area, or cubic miles of land mass and ocean. And then multiply again by hundreds of billions of galaxies and their constituent solar systems. How would our all-knowing entity learn about the exact condition of all these things, and do so at the same time? (We must of course factor in the speed of light, not to mention undefined methods of measurement.) How indeed would all these events throughout the universe not merely be roughly modeled but precisely and accurately predicted? Leaving aside gods and demons, how enormous would a computer need to be in order to formulate such predictions - and what impact would such an enormous computer have on the universe itself? (This impact, too, would need to be predicted because, after all, the computer itself would be part of the universe.)</p>
<p>This brief thought experiment leads me to conclude that determinism is not a serious hypothesis, but a groundless fantasy. And I have much more important things to spend my time on than groundless fantasies!</p>

<h2><a href="1777.html">Writing as Thinking</a></h2>
<h3>2023-04-20</h3>
<p>Why write? I suppose there are many reasons: sharing your opinions, persuading others of your positions on issues, journaling through personal challenges, getting things off your chest, creating something beautiful, making a name for yourself, getting published, perhaps even generating income (good luck with that!).</p>
<p>For myself, I find writing to be my best way of thinking. Perhaps it's just me, but I have the kind of butterfly mind that flits from thing to thing and doesn't stay focused on one task or idea for long. If I merely muse about something, my thoughts tend to remain vague and unformed. Only by forcing myself to create a concrete formulation of what's going through my head do I hone the idea sharply enough for it to be useful.</p>
<p>As an example, I always have a backlog of a few dozen topics I'd like to explore in this weblog, but they remain hazy notions until I write them out. It's only then that I clarify my thinking enough to make what I write part of my mental furniture, as it were. Naturally, the furniture might get moved around further as I have new experiences or if I wish to formalize the relevant thoughts, as I might if they will become part of one of the books I plan to write. But step one is always to put things down on paper.</p>

<h2><a href="1776.html">The Pursuit of Happiness</a></h2>
<h3>2023-04-13</h3>
<p>It's been said that America's three greatest contributions to world civilization are jazz, baseball, and the Declaration of Independence. Much as I like the first two, today is a fine day to ponder the third not only because it is Thomas Jefferson's birthday but also because this blog post is entry number 1776 in the online journal I've been keeping since November of 2000.</p>
<p>In line with my philosophical interests, I'd particularly like to delve into the meaning of Jefferson's felicitous phrase "the pursuit of happiness" (about which, no doubt, several books have been written, although I've not read them). Nowadays we think of happiness as a positive feeling or what the psychologists call subjective well-being - essentially, pleasure. Yet Jefferson and the Founders weren't hedonists or utilitarians, for they felt an abiding kinship with classical conceptions of the good life, as found especially in Cicero, the Stoics, and Aristotle.</p>
<p>For these thinkers, phenomena like knowledge and virtue are pursued for their own sake, even if they do not result in further benefits like wealth or pleasure. And because these phenomena are fundamental goals or purposes for human beings, they are key constituents of living well (Greek Îµá½Î´Î±Î¹Î¼Î¿Î½Î¯Î±).</p>
<p>The most sophisticated account of happiness in this deeper sense comes from Aristotle's philosophy of human affairs, which I will explore in my forthcoming book <cite>Complete Yourself</cite>. Aristotle emphasizes repeatedly that eudaimonia is an activity, not a state of mind or a subjective experience. Thus the constituent goals of eudaimonia must be activities, too: what matters is not virtue as an acquired trait, but virtue exercised, especially activity in accordance with virtue; not knowledge obtained, but knowledge exercised, especially activity in accordance with reason; not pleasure as a feeling experienced, but the enjoyed activity itself.</p>
<p>Did the Founders have an action-oriented conception of human flourishing in mind when they enshrined "the pursuit of happiness" into the Declaration? It seems likely to me. Indeed, I'd further propose that coming to a firmer understanding of human flourishing would enable us to better appreciate and extend the principles of freedom we've been bequeathed by our forebears, for America is an ongoing project to which we all must contribute.</p>
