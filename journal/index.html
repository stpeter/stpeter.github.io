<h2><a href="1802.html">The Value of Re-Reading</a></h2>
<h3>2023-07-26</h3>
<p>Not only do I read a lot, but I also re-read a lot. For instance, so far this year I've re-read the sonnets and a few plays by Shakespeare, three novels by Victor Hugo, the complete poems of Emily Dickinson, several Plato dialogues, and a few of my favorite children's books (<cite>The Wonderful O</cite> by James Thurber and <cite>The Phantom Tollbooth</cite> by Norton O. Juster); plus I'm in the midst of re-reading <cite>The Importance of Living</cite> by Lin Yutang as well as the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite>.</p>
<p>Why revisit books you've read before? And which books make for the best kind of re-reading?</p>
<p>Let me use Emily Dickinson as an example. I've read her complete poems four or five times, over a span of more than twenty years (my first blog post about her was written in 2001). Early on I preferred poems of hers that are brighter, happier, or more immediately striking, such as "I'm nobody! Who are you?", "Tell all the truth but tell it slant", and "Touch lightly nature's sweet guitar". As I've grown older, I've come to treasure many of her darker, sadder, quieter poems, too. Indeed, she has helped me appreciate and accept the significance of phenomena such as death and heartache, about which she wrote repeatedly, almost obsessively. I likely wasn't ready for those poems in my early thirties, but by sticking with Emily I've been able to learn from her.</p>
<p>Naturally, this wouldn't have been possible if she weren't such an amazing poet. One doesn't typically stick with an author if she isn't very good.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't mean one must restrict one's reading to books that are considered to be the greatest of all time; how much an author resonates with you is far more important than the grandness of their reputation. I prefer Hugo to Tolstoy and Thoreau to Kant, and I don't give a whit about their reputed differences in quality.</p>
<p>One caveat: what resonates with you can change over time. I didn't like Plato when I was 20 years old, but now I find his dialogues quite fascinating. Although I doubt that I'll revisit the impenetrable Kant, I won't rule it out.</p>
<p>Finally, I do also regularly expose myself to authors who are new to me. Perhaps I'll write a post about the value of literary and intellectual exploration...</p>

<h2><a href="1801.html">The Importance of Living</a></h2>
<h3>2023-07-24</h3>
<p>Twelve years ago when I was in Taipei for a weeklong standardization meeting, I snuck off one morning to visit the former home of Lin Yutang, where I bought a copy of his 1937 masterpiece <cite>The Importance of Living</cite>. Every few years I dip into this book, and each time I'm reminded of things I never should have forgotten. What a treasure it is! I definitely need to add it to my list of best friend books.</p>
<p>This time around, I got hooked by reading one of the essays toward the end (not "The True Aim of Education" but "Why I Am a Pagan") and decided to start over from the beginning. Throughout, Lin provides deep insights and charming anecdotes that illustrate what he aptly calls the importance of living. Not for him philosophical theory divorced from our common humanity and the pursuit of happiness; rather, he knows that wisdom has no value if lacks practical applications or is not enjoyable for its own sake. He is such a master of personalism and "what is near" that I'm tempted to call him not Lin but Lin-tse (or "Master Lin") on the model of the great Chinese Taoists Lao-tse and Chuang-tse. An absolute delight!</p>

<h2><a href="1800.html">The Philosophical is the Personal</a></h2>
<h3>2023-07-23</h3>
<p>After further reflection on my post about the siren song of systemic solutions, I've come up with a generalization that I'm trying on for size: <em>the philosophical is the personal</em>.</p>
<p>The upshot of Carol Hanisch's dictum "the personal is the political" is that in truth there's no such thing as the purely personal, because everything personal is tinged with or completely dominated by the realm of politics. The upshot of "the philosophical is the personal" would be that in truth there's no such thing as the purely philosophical in the theoretical sense, because everything philosophical must be cashed out into a person's thoughts, choices, actions, and feelings. This would be a corollary of philosophical personalism.</p>
<p>A more radical doctrine would be that philosophical theories are utterly useless or literally have no existence, whether independent or dependent. I wouldn't go that far because we humans are conceptual beings. As always, the challenge is to find the beautifully right balance, in this case within the dialectic between theory and practice. I weight heavily toward practice, but that doesn't mean theory has no value, only that it is subservient to the needs of human life and human fulfillment. Or, as I quoted from Aristotle recently when talking about philosophical parsimony, we must bring what we say "to the test of the facts of life, and if it harmonizes with the facts we must accept it, but if it clashes with them we must suppose it to be mere theory."</p>

<h2><a href="1799.html">The Siren Song of Systemic Solutions</a></h2>
<h3>2023-07-21</h3>
<p>One often hears that "systemic problems require systemic solutions." Although I used to agree, now I'm not so sure.</p>
<p>Consider Carol Hanisch's famous 1969 essay <cite>The Personal is the Political</cite>, in which she asserted: "There are no personal solutions at this time. There is only collective action for a collective solution."</p>
<p>On the one hand, I suppose it might be energizing to believe such a thing, at least if you have an activist mindset. On the other hand, it can close off the pursuit of any and all non-systemic solutions. That might be of questionable value, since individualized, ad-hoc solutions have several benefits, chief among which that they can be achieved more easily and more quickly (even if not more completely). If you believe only in collective, systemic solutions, it seems likely that you will never solve the problems you have identified; instead, you'll be living only for the distant future, like the Marxists who believed that true human happiness would flower only after the withering away of the state.</p>
<p>Even worse, eliminating personal solutions from your field of vision and action can lead to a kind of learned helplessness, since there is nothing you can do that applies to your particular situation. Yet I cannot emphasize strongly enough that <em>life is always lived in the particulars</em>. Strictly speaking, all those ideas and abstractions floating around in books and people's heads and the culture at large don't have an independent existence. Naturally, we humans are linguistic and encultured beings whose concepts utterly infuse how we understand and experience ourselves and the world around us. Yet it is all too easy to believe that the isms we endlessly invent are the primary realities in human life. <em>They are not.</em></p>
<p>Instead, what's primary are things like the people we love, the conversations we engage in, the stories we tell, the authors we treasure, the music we make, the artifacts we create, the activities we experience, the dwellings we inhabit, the towns we build, the places we visit, and the food we eat. (It would take a book by the likes of Lin Yutang to unfold all the implications of this aphorism by Epicurus: "The beginning and root of all good is the pleasure of the stomach; even wisdom and refinements have reference to this.") These are the things that are near to us, and they have far greater value in our lives than systemic solutions to systemic problems.</p>

<h2><a href="1798.html">Incomplete Enlightenment</a></h2>
<h3>2023-07-09</h3>
<p>The other day I glanced briefly at Ray Dalio's book <cite>Principles</cite>, which made something of a splash when it was published a few years ago. I decided not to read the book (for now) because I wasn't impressed by the few sections I looked at; in particular, he seems to reduce the art of living to two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify what you want.</li>
<li>Figure out how to attain it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Contrast that with classical philosophers like Socrates and Aristotle, whose fundamental counsel I would summarize as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Come to deeply understand what is true and good and beautifully right.</li>
<li>Moderate your desires so that they harmonize with that wisdom.</li>
</ol>
<p>Scholars such as Blaine Fowers often describe Dalio's two principles as "individualism" and "instrumentalism". Individualism (I might even call it "selfism") is the idea that the self is irreducible and unquestionable: all goods are purely individual (no shared goods or higher goods), and whatever you desire is plainly and simply the good as far as you are concerned. Instrumentalism is the idea that only reasoning about means really matters; reasoning about ends is unnecessary because the good is straightforwardly given by our desires.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, individualism and instrumentalism emerged from the Enlightenment, which led philosophers and eventually psychologists to focus above all else on what is empirically measurable. Not for these moderns the old immeasurables like the good life. For instance, in his post "Toward an Enlightened Centrism" a few months ago, blogger Richard Hanania expressed "skepticism of certain kinds of philosophy, particularly old philosophy"; he went on to doubt that there is any use in studying "ancient sages" because they don't "have much to tell us about the world today", preferring "empirical knowledge" to "theoretical constructs" of the kind one might find in Aristotle.</p>
<p>Yet if your idea of the good life is "identify what you want" and "figure out how to attain it", I'd say your level of enlightenment is woefully incomplete, to put it mildly. Sure, you might be able to measure the extent to which people are satisfying their desires, but you have no idea whether those desires were any good in the first place; like the fanatics of the French Revolution, you might have glorified Reason while losing all semblance of wisdom. This is precisely the fate that those old philosophers would have saved you from, if only you hadn't refused to read them.</p>
<p>Or, to use a phrase from a great American philosopher in a new context: "We're lost, but we're making good time!"</p>

<h2><a href="1797.html">Philosophical Parsimony</a></h2>
<h3>2023-07-10</h3>
<p>If "say implies do" - if the beliefs that you profess are constrained by consistency with the behaviors you enact - then doesn't that severely limit the scope of philosophical speculation?</p>
<p>Indeed it does. That's a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>As I've explored before, many people conceive philosophy as a way of life to work like this: some great thinker initiates a school of thought, then its adherents identify with those ideas so strongly that they do whatever they must to put them into practice. It's a one-way street from leader to followers.</p>
<p>Although that model can help the adherents learn from the wisdom of the founder, it can also lead to all sorts of distortions if the adherents take that wisdom for certainty; a prime example is personal suppression of thoughts and behaviors that are not completely consistent with the original theory. Consider, for example, the very human phenomenon of grief. The ancient Stoics discouraged grieving, even going so far as to assert that you don't grieve over a broken cup, so why do you grieve over the loss of a spouse or child? Although that position is, to my mind, literally inhuman, an adherent of Stoicism might feel guilty about not living up to it.</p>
<p>Better, I think, to make sure that traffic on the street also flows in the other direction, so that you assent to a principle only if it arises from within your existing practice. This leads to a healthy sort of philosophical parsimony, a wisdom that is aligned with life as you live it. This approach to philosophy is almost scientific in its austerity, since theory must always align with the evidence of life.</p>
<p>Even better is a two-way street, in which wisdom and practice exist in a mutually reinforcing dialectic of continual learning and self-improvement. In my experience, this works best if I open myself to insights from many different schools of thought, since most of them have grasped some but not all of the truth in human affairs. By deeply encountering various thinkers and judiciously attempting to put their ideas into practice, I determine for myself whether I will accept their insights as part of my chosen wisdom.</p>
<p>In Book X of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>, Aristotle makes two statements that comport with this dialectical vision:</p>
<blockquote>True arguments seem most useful, not only with a view to knowledge, but with a view to life also; for since they harmonize with the facts they are believed, and so they stimulate those who understand them to live according to them.</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>The truth in practical matters is discerned from the facts of life; for these are the decisive factor. We must therefore survey what we have already said, bringing it to the test of the facts of life, and if it harmonizes with the facts we must accept it, but if it clashes with them we must suppose it to be mere theory.</blockquote>
<p>If more thinkers pursued this approach to the love and practice of wisdom, they would be more successful at threading a middle path and thus avoiding extreme opinions such as the Stoic position on grief. Although I don't expect that philosophical theorists will change their stripes, it's a policy that those who engage in the examined life can readily accept.</p>
