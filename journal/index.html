<h2><a href="1900.html">Walking with Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics VI.12-13</a></h2>
<h3>2024-09-15</h3>
<p>In the final two chapters of Nicomachean Ethics Book VI, Aristotle asks some probing questions about thrivings of mind and character.</p>
<p>First, although sagacity [sophia] provides understanding [epistēmē] and insight [nous] into the sources and causes of things, is it of any use in the pursuit of fulfillment [eudaimonia]? Actually, yes. Aristotle reasons that even if sagacity and wisdom did not have practical uses, still they would be valuable because they are excellences of their respective parts or tasks of the thinking soul: grasping the nature of what is in the case of sagacity, and deliberating about how to act in the case of wisdom. Eudaimonia is not merely a feeling (or even a series of positive emotional experiences extended over a lifetime), but the complete development and thriving of your core human capacities, i.e., not happiness in the modern sense but deep and true fulfillment.</p>
<p>Second, because excellences of character like courage and moderation are acquired traits [hexeis], can they function well enough simply with occasional external guidance from others, thus obviating the need to individually cultivate practical wisdom [phronēsis]? Well, no: the task of living a fully human life is brought to completion by one's own wisdom of mind and excellence of character. Specifically, virtue [aretē] establishes the correctness of the target [skopos] you're trying to hit in life, and wisdom establishes the correctness of what brings you closer to doing so.</p>
<p>To further explain the role of wisdom, Aristotle contrasts it with mere cleverness [deinotēs]. The clever person can figure out how to achieve any goal, no matter whether it's beautifully right [kalos] or repulsively wrong [aischros]. The wise person has this ability, too, but it operates in service of the ultimate source [archē] of action, which is the completion [telos] of human capacities and the best thing achievable in action. Whereas corruption [mochthēria] of character warps a person's insights into the source of human action and goodness, excellence [aretē] of character preserves and reinforces such insights, along with the actions that flow from them. Thus Aristotle maintains that it is impossible to be wise without being good.</p>
<p>A similar contrast can be drawn between virtue in the authoritative sense [kurios] and inborn [phusikos] virtue. Some people seem to be naturally courageous or temperate or generous - isn't that good enough? No, because the person who has such inborn virtues can easily go astray without insight [nous]. Indeed, these natural propensities to action merely resemble the excellences of character, whereas virtue in the authoritative sense comes about only through the direction of practical wisdom and the correct account [orthos logos] of one's activities. Yet Aristotle takes things even one step further than Socrates, who said that there is no virtue without wisdom: for he claims that virtue is utterly suffused with the correct account [meta tou orthou logou]. Thus Aristotle concludes not only that is it impossible to be wise without being good, but also that it is impossible to be good without being wise.</p>
<p>Notice that Aristotle formulates no rules for action, nor does he say exactly what the correct account or best form of practical reasoning [sullogismos] is. As I see it, that's because the person who takes life seriously - the spoudaios - uses both sagacity and wisdom to gain insight into the universal sources of the human good and into the particular opportunities for manifesting the good in specific situations. Although it certainly helps to grasp some general patterns of human behavior and principles for action (that's what the excellences of character are all about), there are no hard-and-fast rules for bridging the gap because each situation is unique. This is especially true in human relationships, which are fundamental to the good life because we are social animals; we'll see this come to fruition in Books VIII and IX, a little farther along in our walk with Aristotle.</p>

<h2><a href="1899.html">Information vs. Wisdom</a></h2>
<h3>2024-09-10</h3>
<p>The world is awash with information. Some information is misinformation (falsehoods), and some misinformation is disinformation (deliberate falsehoods), but all of it is stuff that needs to processed in order to be useful, otherwise it's not much better than gossip or rumor.</p>
<p>Some people believe that misinformation must be suppressed lest other people do stupid or harmful things. A recent example would be the riots in England, which are alleged to have been "caused" by false rumors about the identity of someone who killed and injured children at a party. Additional examples are easily found, and I suspect they will multiply significantly once "AI" programs are used more frequently to generate "content" for posting on "social" media.</p>
<p>But here's the thing: human beings aren't Skinnerian stimulus-response machines. Those who give their attention to rumors and then take action (especially violent action like rioting or attacking those they disagree with) based on those rumors aren't merely misinformed - more fundamentally, they lack wisdom. If you ask me, the untruths aren't to blame; instead, it's those who haven't bothered to acquire a modicum of wisdom and common sense in the first place.</p>
<p>Although wisdom won't inoculate you from all foolishness, it certainly helps!</p>

<h2><a href="1898.html">Homeric Ambiguity</a></h2>
<h3>2024-09-08</h3>
<p>One of the many fascinating aspects of both the <cite>Iliad</cite> and the <cite>Odyssey</cite> is the fundamental ambiguity of Homer's stories. Is the <cite>Iliad</cite> a great war poem - or a great <em>anti-war</em> poem? Is Achilles really the hero of the <cite>Iliad</cite>, or is it perhaps Hector (whose death and funeral mark the end of the poem)? Are the gods the sources and enforcers of justice, or are they just as often capriciously unjust (e.g., in causing the ten-year wanderings of Odysseus after the Trojan War)? And so on.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons Plato had Socrates express so many reservations about Homer in the <cite>Republic</cite>. For the very same reason, Homer was a favorite among Greek thinkers of a questioning mindset, such as Pyrrho and his disciple Timon of Phlius. This essential ambiguity will provide much fodder for reflection in my projected epic poem about Pyrrho and Alexander the Great.</p>

<h2><a href="1897.html">Walking with Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics VI.9-11</a></h2>
<h3>2024-09-05</h3>
<p>Here toward the end of Book VI Aristotle looks at several skills and traits that are either constituents of wisdom or similar to wisdom in certain respects: deliberative excellence [euboulia], astuteness [sunesis], thoughtfulness [gnōmē], and sensitivity [sungnōmē].</p>
<p>Deliberative excellence is not conceptual understanding [epistēmē] since it deals with particulars, but neither is it mere opinion [doxa] or guesstimation since the person who deliberates well about what to do can provide an account [logos] for their actions and commitments. Instead, it's a matter of correctly [orthōs] thinking things through [dianoia] about what gets us closer to our goals [ta pros to telos]. Yet there are two kinds of goal: particular goals we might just happen to have, and the overall goal of living well. Deliberative excellence "plain and simple" [haplōs] is closely connected to wisdom [phronēsis], since both are concerned with "the sort of things that are conducive to living well as a whole" (1140a28).</p>
<p>Astuteness [sunesis] is quickness in perceiving situations in which we get stuck or reach an impasse [aporia] and thus cause us to deliberate or take counsel. Although astuteness isn't exactly wisdom, it enables us to more readily and appropriately use the wisdom we already possess.</p>
<p>Thoughtfulness [gnōmē] and sensitivity [sungnōmē] consist in correctly [orthōs] discerning what is humane [epieikos]. In Book V, Aristotle had observed that humaneness "sets things straight" and "speaks correctly" [orthōs], thus honoring the spirit of justice rather than the mere letter.</p>
<p>All of these mental traits - along with insight [nous] - converge on the same point: that doing what's beautifully right [kalos] is not a matter of following abstract rules but of apprehending the particular possibilities inherent in each opportune moment [kairos] we live through. Indeed, because the particulars are the sources [archai] of our insight into why we take action in life, it's important to pay heed to people who have a great deal of experience [empeiria] of life. Such people grasp the truth in significant ways, even if they can't exactly spell out why they do what they do; thus their actions and statements provide valuable material for ethical reflection and the examined life.</p>
<p>In the remaining chapters (12-13) of Book VI, Aristotle will put these various strands together and provide provisional answers about the nature of wisdom and sagacity. Onward and upward!</p>

<h2><a href="1896.html">Walking with Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics VI.6-8</a></h2>
<h3>2024-09-03</h3>
<p>In the most recent installment of our walk with Aristotle, we puzzled through the beginnings of his analysis of wisdom [phronēsis]. In Book VI.6-8 he climbs further up this steep section of the trail to discuss not only wisdom but also sagacity [sophia].</p>
<p>In the single paragraph of VI.6, Aristotle says that when we truly have understanding [epistēmē] of something, we can reliably engage in spelling out [apodeixis] why it is the way it is. Yet not everything can be spelled out: at some point in the chain of explanation we come to aspects of reality that can only be seen, albeit not perceptually but intellectually. He calls these the sources [archai] of things and says that the mental trait or practice [hexis] involved is insight [nous].</p>
<p>According to Aristotle, we need both understanding [epistēmē] and insight [nous] to have precise and reliable "truthing" [alētheuein] of the most important [timiōtatos] and serious [spoudaiotatos] aspects of reality and human experience, which are unchanging. He identifies this combination as sophia, which I render as "sagacity". By contrast, wisdom [phronēsis] concerns things we can deliberate about and change through our actions.</p>
<p>It's a common misconception, I think, that on Aristotle's account sagacity is limited to truths about mathematics, astronomy, theology, and the like - and that it doesn't apply to the sublunary realm of living things and human beings. Yet according to Aristotle animal species are eternal and unchanging (a topic for another time) and we can't decide to be other than we are; thus disciplines such as biology, psychology, and ethics are just as much objects of sagacity as the more rarified sciences.</p>
<p>Indeed, Aristotle claims that even action-guiding wisdom [phronēsis] needs to grasp not only the particulars of specific situations but also the universals of human nature and the human good. This might even imply that you can't be consistently good in your actions unless you have some measure of sagacity in your thoughts. Nevertheless, the primary focus of action and decision remains with the particulars, which is why it's necessary to have experience [empeiria] of life in order to be wise. In a field like mathematics, experience isn't required and young people can succeed admirably, whereas in ethics and action young people are full of theoretical talk (1142a21, cf. 1105b13) but haven't yet integrated the lessons of experience into their practice of life.</p>
<p>In the chapters that follow (VI.9-11), Aristotle will further analyze the constituent faculties and activities of action-guiding wisdom. We'll look at those next time.</p>

<h2><a href="1895.html">A Republic If You Can Keep It</a></h2>
<h3>2024-08-30</h3>
<p>Every year around Independence Day, I carve out time to read and reflect on the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution; and every year I notice something new. This year it was the first clause in Article IV, Section 4: "The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government." As with everything else in the Constitution, this "guarantee clause" has been analyzed historically, legally, and philosophically over the last 200+ years. Although I'm not a scholar of the Constitution and don't plan to become one, my curiosity was piqued, so I decided to gain a slightly better understanding of republicanism (with a small "r").</p>
<p>James Madison, the primary framer of the Constitution, defined republicanism as that form of government "which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people", thus opposing it to governments in which some or all of the powers are held by one person or a certain faction of the people. In his book <cite>From Oligarchy to Republicanism: The Great Task of Reconstruction</cite>, Forrest A. Nabors observes that "a key test of republicanism is whether the people for whom the law is made are the makers of the law", in contrast to the "imperial rule" that obtains "when an outside power makes the law for others who must live by the law" (p. 11) - which, of course, was the condition of the colonies before independence. He also notes that Madison was not impressed by the novel constitutional interpretations put forward decades later by John C. Calhoun and his ilk, whom he called "disciples of aristocracy, oligarchy or monarchy" (p. 13).</p>
<p>According to Nabors, perhaps the most daring innovation of the framers was to attempt the founding of a <em>large</em> republic; unlike the small republics of, say, ancient Athens or Renaissance Venice, the U.S.A. was designed to scale up indefinitely. A key constitutional construct intended to make large-scale republicanism work in practice was federalism: "'the division and organization of power' between the national government and the state governments" whereby "powers appropriate to national objects were enumerated and given to the national government in the Constitution" while "all others remained with the states" (p. 11) - or, as the Tenth Amendment says, even "reserved to the people".</p>
<p>Over time, the American people have progressively discarded federalism, so that more and more powers have been concentrated in the central government. It strikes me that this hasn't worked out all that well, since decision-making happens ever more distantly from the people, most things have been "nationalized" so tussles over policy seem increasingly existential, and more and more the laws and regulations promulgated in the District of Columbia feel like imperial impositions by an "outside power".</p>
<p>Even though a healthy dose of federalism might be part of the cure for our partisan death spiral, I'm not optimistic that collectively we'll come to that realization unless truly pressed to seek radical solutions to what ails the American body politic.</p>
<p>In any case, political musings like these, while interesting at times, touch on matters that are far outside my span of influence and control, so I try not to engage in them very often. Your mileage may vary. :-)</p>
