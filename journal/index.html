<h2><a href="1745.html">Moderation</a></h2>
<h3>2022-11-17</h3>
<p>First, happy World Philosophy Day!</p>
<p>Speaking of philosophy, in my post last week about the wisdom of Socrates, I suggested that he lost his head in his attachment to Alcibiades. And the phrase "lost his head" is appropriate, because in ancient Greek the opposite of doing so was σωφροσύνη, which although usually translated as "moderation" or "temperance" literally means "mind-saving" or "mind-keeping".</p>
<p>Moderation sounds boring. It's so damn reasonable! To those who relish more passion and excitement, it even smacks of selling out. Yet I think moderation is underrated.</p>
<p>First and quite obviously, as Socrates discovered, losing your head can get you in an awful lot of trouble. Countless human beings throughout history have gone astray through unreasonable levels of fear, greed, desire, anger, and other emotions.</p>
<p>Second, you don't need to be immoderate in order to experience the wonders, joys, and pleasures that life has to offer. Too often we are offered only the choice of pure reason vs. pure emotion, but it doesn't take much reflection to realize that this is a false alternative.</p>
<p>Indeed, as Socrates himself argued at length in Plato's dialogue <cite>Philebus</cite>, the union of pleasure with mind and wisdom produces the most beautiful of lives for a human being.</p>
<p>There's no shame in being moderate and reasonable in life. Or, as I sometimes like to put it: Dare to be dull!</p>

<h2><a href="1744.html">How Wise Was Socrates?</a></h2>
<h3>2022-11-10</h3>
<p>Did you know that Socrates' 2500th birthday will occur in 2032? Lately I've been pondering the possibility of writing by then an intellectual biography of Socrates.</p>
<p>One of the hard questions about Socrates is why he was so devoted to Alcibiades, the ultra-rich and incredibly handsome bad boy of 5th-century Athens. Friedrich Hölderlin composed the following poem about the matter:</p>
<blockquote>
„Warum huldigest du, heiliger Sokrates,<br>
Diesem Jünglinge stets? kennest du Größers nicht?<br>
Warum siehet mit Liebe,<br>
Wie auf Götter, dein Aug’ auf ihn?“
<br><br>
Wer das Tiefste gedacht, liebt das Lebendigste,<br>
Hohe Jugend versteht, wer in die Welt geblickt,<br>
Und es neigen die Weisen<br>
Oft am Ende zu Schönem sich.
</blockquote>
<p>Casting this poem into Sapphic meter (which seems fitting given the similar subject-matter of Sappho Fragment 31), I would translate it as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
“Why, O holy Socrates, do you pursue<br>
This youngster? Don’t you know anything greater?<br>
Why do you gaze at him with love in your heart,<br>
As if he’s a god?”
<br><br>
One who has plumbed the depths loves what's most alive;<br>
Knows the bloom of youth who's looked upon the world.<br>
And yet in the end those who are wise often<br>
Bend toward beauty.
</blockquote>
<p>Although the sentiment is attractive, Hölderlin's poem evades the question. Was the sagely Socrates intemperate in his relationship with Alcibiades? If so, was Socrates really as wise as everyone thought?</p>
<p>Recall that when Socrates' friend Chaerephon asked the Delphic Oracle whether anyone was wiser than Socrates, her answer was "No." But because in general the Oracle's wording could be notoriously ambiguous, her statement "no one is wiser" could have meant several things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>At least one person is just as wise as Socrates.</li>
  <li>Everyone is equally wise.</li>
  <li>No one is wise.</li>
</ol>
<p>While it might be true that "those who are wise often bend toward beauty", the same might be true of those who are unwise! Thus Socrates' behavior toward Alcibiades doesn't necessarily put him in good company.</p>
<p>Socrates is the fountainhead of Western philosophy. His life deserves to be examined anew by every thinking person, and I might do just that in a future book entitled, appropriately enough, "No One Wiser"...</p>

<h2><a href="1743.html">The True Self</a></h2>
<h3>2022-11-03</h3>
<p>When we delved into the ancient Greek phrases "Know Thyself" and "Become What You Are" recently, I promised to look more closely at the recent notion of the true self, so here we go.</p>
<p>One basic illustration of the difference between moderns and ancients on this topic is that nowadays we easily throw around the word "self" (perhaps even capitalized "Self") as a standalone entity, whereas in the Greek phrase γνῶθι σαυτόν the word σαυτόν is a reflexive pronoun that does not imply the existence of a Self in all its modern glory. As we might put the matter: it's know thyself, not know thy Self.</p>
<p>Without getting too far into scholarly exegesis, we can see something similar happening in Aristotle's discussion of friendship, where he famously says that "a friend is another self" (Nicomachean Ethics, 1170b6-7). Here the idea is not that someone dear to you is a separate and singular Self of inherent dignity and worth, but that the person is similar to yourself (expressed, again, with a reflexive pronoun).</p>
<p>Speaking of Aristotle, here is how H. Rackham translates a key passage in the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> (1178a2 ff.) in the Loeb classical series:</p>
<blockquote>It may even be held that [the intellect] is the true self of each, inasmuch as it is the dominant and better part; and therefore it would be a strange thing if a man should choose to live not his own life but the life of some other than himself.</blockquote>
<p>The problem is that "the true self" is nowhere to be found in the original Greek, which says only that "it seems that each one is indeed this" (Aristotle's Greek can be quite compressed!).</p> 
<p>So where did we get this idea of a "true self" that is inborn and must be discovered within? Can we find it, for instance, in Shakespeare? After all, in <cite>Hamlet</cite> Polonius gives this piece of advice to his son Laertus: "to thine own self be true". The Bard, in turn, was likely influenced by perhaps the first thinker to unabashedly celebrate the self: Montaigne, who in the preface to his <cite>Essays</cite> of 1580/1588 wrote:</p>
<blockquote>Had my intention been to seek the world’s favour, I should surely have adorned myself with borrowed beauties: I desire therein to be viewed as I appear in mine own genuine, simple, and ordinary manner, without study and artifice: for it is myself I paint. My defects are therein to be read to the life, and any imperfections and my natural form, so far as public reverence hath permitted me. If I had lived among those nations, which (they say) yet dwell under the sweet liberty of nature’s primitive laws, I assure thee I would most willingly have painted myself quite fully and quite naked. Thus, reader, myself am the matter of my book: there’s no reason thou shouldst employ thy leisure about so frivolous and vain a subject.</blockquote>
<p>Yet although Montaigne claimed that he was being true to himself, neither he nor Shakespeare made any claims about the existence of a "true self".</p>
<p>As far as I know, our modern conception of the true self might be found first in the writings of the Danish Christian thinker Søren Kierkegaard (1813-1855). Consider this passage from his book <cite>Purity of Heart Is to Will One Thing</cite>, quoted with approval by David L. Norton on page 67 of <cite>Personal Destinies</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>I do not now whether it is true that at each man's birth two angels are born, his good angel and his bad angel. But this I do believe (and I will gladly listen to any objection, although I will not believe it) that at each man's birth there comes into being an eternal vocation for him, expressly for him. To be true to himself in relation to this eternal vocation is the highest thing a man can practice, and, as that most profound poet has said: "Self-love is not so vile a sin as self-forgetting." [Shakespeare, Henry V, Act 2, Scene 4] Then there is but one fault, one offense: disloyalty to his own self or the denial of his own better self.</blockquote>
<p>There are clear connections between Kierkegaard's idea of an "eternal vocation" and the older Christian idea of a personal calling, i.e., of being called by God to perform a certain kind of work in the world. However, although a calling might deeply color one's long-term goals and characteristic activities, it seems that we can still distinguish the person from the calling. That feels less straightforward when we speak of a person's true self. Indeed, my friend Kurt Keefner shared an excellent formulation with me recently: "the self is a person viewed from its own point of view"; thus that eternal vocation is, as Nietzsche put it in the imperative form in <cite>The Joyful Wisdom</cite>: "You shall become the person you are."</p>
<p>There is much, much more to say on this theme, but this mini-essay is already longer than I'd like, so I'll save further reflections for another day.</p>

<h2><a href="1742.html">Become What You Are</a></h2>
<h3>2022-10-27</h3>
<p>Following on our investigation last week of the ancient Greek maxim "Know Thyself", I thought it might be interesting to explain another Greek phrase that has gained currency in recent times: "Become What You Are".</p>
<p>In his book <cite>Personal Destinies</cite> (which I've started to re-read after a gap of perhaps 30 years and which I'll report on much more fully in future posts), philosopher David L. Norton puts "Become What You Are" on an equal footing with "Know Thyself" in ancient Greek culture. Yet this is far from the truth. "Know Thyself" was on everyone's lips (as Plato puts it) and it echoed throughout Greek culture, whereas "Become What You Are" was a single line in a poem by Pindar.</p>
<p>In Greek it reads γένοι' οἷος ἐσσὶ μαθών which we can well translate as "become such as you are, having learned what that is." The "such as you are" is key: this is not about your unique individuality but about the kind of human, mortal being you are. Pindar makes this clear in the remainder of his second Pythian Ode, where he emphasizes that "a man must always measure all things according to his own place" and that "one must not fight against a god". Indeed, Pindar's intent here is quite consistent with "Know Thyself" in the sense of knowing your place, as explained in my previous post.</p>
<p>So where did this idea come from that "Become What You Are" means something like Shakespeare's "to thine own self be true"? I finger Nietzsche, who made much of Pindar's line in his book <cite>The Joyful Wisdom</cite>. Now, I happen to like what Nietzsche did with Pindar and I even composed a poem entitled "Become What You Are" for my collection <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite>, but that doesn't imply that Pindar or the ancient Greeks in general thought about the self as we do.</p>
<p>Having cleared away some of the underbrush, next time I'll look into our modern notion of the true self.</p>

<h2><a href="1741.html">Know Thyself</a></h2>
<h3>2022-10-20</h3>
<p>The saying γνῶθι σαυτόν ("know thyself") was prominently displayed at the temple of Delphi, where ancient Greeks, Romans, Persians, and others sought answers to their most pressing questions. Yet what is it exactly to know thyself? Essential clues can be found in an obscure little book published in 1916: <cite>"Know Thyself" in Greek and Latin Literature</cite>, in which Eliza Gregory Wilkins collected almost all mentions of the maxim up until the fall of Rome.</p>
<p>Here are some of the key meanings:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Know your measure and limits. In ancient Greece, well-known examples of people who didn't know their limits were Alcibiades and Alexander the Great; the latter in particular had the hubris to think that he was a god. Less exceptional citizens might over-estimate their power, their status, their influence, the loyalty of their friends, the stability of their wealth, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>Know what you can and cannot do. This sense, which implies neither over-estimating nor under-estimating your abilities, is well illustrated by the myth of Icarus trying, impossibly, to fly to the sun. A more prosaic example is that of the Sophistic teachers, who claimed superior abilities to impart wisdom but in fact lacked such skills.</p></li>
<li><p>Know your place. Here "know thyself" verges on the virtue of moderation or self-regulation (σωφροσύνη): someone who was ignorant of his place was liable inappropriately engage in wild, immoderate, self-indulgent behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>Know the limits of your knowledge and wisdom. Consider, for example, that Alcibiades (in his eponymous dialogue) thought he was ready to take a leading part in the public affairs of Athens even though he was only 20 years old. Indeed, throughout the Socratic dialogues of both Plato and Xenophon, Socrates delights in exposing the pretensions of those who claim to know more than they really do.</p></li>
<li><p>Know your faults. As Aristotle says in the <cite>Magna Moralia</cite>, because we don't know ourselves we tend to criticize others for the very same faults that we ourselves have; one of the benefits of having close personal relationships is that our friends and relations might feel free to point out our failings even when we don't want to own up to them.</p></li>
<li><p>Know you are human and mortal. This sense was often expressed by the idea that you should stay aware that you will die eventually, with the result that you might savor your mortal existence. A related aspect was often expressed by the maxim that "one who is human should think mortal thoughts" and therefore not reach for the divine.</p></li>
<li><p>Know your soul. In tension with that last thought, knowing your soul could involve a recognition of the soul's divine origin or nature, as in Plato's <cite>Phaedo</cite> or book ten of Aristotle's <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>. Alternatively, it could involve awareness of the conflicting drives experienced by human beings, so that you could achieve greater internal harmony. Or consider Aristotle's repeated statement that we are social animals and thus need to understand interpersonal relationships in order to thrive in society.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The astute reader will have noticed that one meaning conspicuously absent in ancient times was the very one we especially treasure nowadays: knowing your singular uniqueness, discovering your true self, cherishing your individuality, and the like. I'll have more to say on this score in a future post.</p>

<h2><a href="1740.html">Agreement Is Overrated</a></h2>
<h3>2022-10-13</h3>
<p>How many times has a friend sent you a link to an essay with the proviso "I don't agree with everything this person says, but it's worth reading"? I used to do that, too, but then I reflected on whether intellectual agreement is truly important, and I concluded that it's not.</p>
<p>Part of the story is that I don't always agree with myself. Given that I've been blogging for over twenty years and was writing for publication years before then, it should come as no surprise that I don't agree with everything I wrote so long ago. Yet I don't even fully agree with things I wrote a few weeks ago! A case in point is my recent critique of Hanno Sauer's paper on the uselessness of philosophical history, since I find value in engaging philosophically with the latest scientific research rather than cloistering myself away in an exclusive study of the ancients (although I'm also convinced that the wisdom of the ancients can be rather helpful in such engagement).</p>
<p>But that's not all: thinking that I need to maintain consistency with every position I've ever held or expressed is artificially constraining. Socrates and Aristotle both said that "philosophy begins in wonder" - and wondering inevitably leads to wandering as I explore side paths, follow leads (one of my favorite parts of any book is the bibliography), make connections across thinkers and disciplines, delve into the details, seek out evidence, ponder the implications, question what I've read, and test out ideas by attempting to act on them.</p>
<p>These practices are a way of cultivating intellectual pluralism in my own head, which is more fundamental but also more difficult than respecting intellectual pluralism in society (as important as that is). One of the easiest things in the world is to persuade myself that I, uniquely among all human beings, have chanced upon the truth and that everyone else is mistaken. Well, not <em>everyone</em> else, because humans are social animals and we like to flock together with likeminded people who share a group identity as those few who have found the truth. This, of course, is why agreement feels so good and appears so obligatory in the first place, but it's a siren call that I try (not always successfully!) to resist.</p>
<p>Note: I realize that this is a controversial topic, so do feel free to disagree!</p>
