<h2><a href="1708.html">Egoism, Altruism, and Oxygen Masks</a></h2>
<h3>2022-04-06</h3>
<p>A friend asked me recently if I think that self-improvement is selfish. My short answer was that building up your character is a matter of cultivating your higher self rather than gratifying your lower self, so this activity might exist beyond the dichotomy of egoism vs. altruism.</p>
<p>Here's an analogy that's fresh in my mind because I travelled on a commercial airline flight recently: in the unlikely event of a loss of cabin pressure, oxygen masks will be released from the panel above your head and if you need to assist another passenger make sure to put on your own mask first!</p>
<p>You can't truly and lastingly benefit those you care about unless you're living well yourself: seeking wisdom, paying attention, thinking carefully, communicating clearly, listening closely, empathizing generously, avoiding anger and contempt and other negative emotions, maintaining mature coping skills, staying serene, investing in your relationships, and so on. I suppose that improving your practices in all of these areas is selfish in one sense because you're creating a better self, but it's also the greatest gift you can give to the people you love because you're bringing a better self to all of your interactions.</p>
<p>Merely theoretical philosophers love to argue and debate about false alternatives like egoism vs. altruism, whereas practical philosophers relish jumping into the manifest complexities of actively achieving a better self and applying those better practices in the real world. The love of wisdom is not a spectator sport!</p>

<h2><a href="1707.html">The Meanings of Meaning</a></h2>
<h3>2022-03-28</h3>
<p>If you tell people that you're interested in philosophy, inevitably someone will ask you about the meaning of life. Although the question might predate <cite>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</cite>, ancient philosophers in the Greek, Indian, and Chinese traditions didn't raise it. Personally I adhere to the aphorism that it's best not to puzzle over the meaning of life, but instead work to create a life of meaning.</p>
<p>We can find the same distinction between the meaning <em>OF</em> life and meaning <em>IN</em> life within modern psychology. For instance, Michael F. Steger (who works just up the road from me at Colorado State University) has done quite a bit of research on meaning in life. His model of personal meaning involves three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A cognitive aspect of having an understanding of how the world works and of your place in the world</li>
<li>A motivational aspect of having long-term, overarching purposes that structure your goals and activities</li>
<li>An evaluative aspect of feeling that your your life as a whole is significant and worthwhile, that it matters</li>
</ul>
<p>These are aspects of mind and behavior that you can work on through reflection and self-improvement, so I'm all in favor of them.</p>
<p>By contrast, asking "what is the meaning of life?" leads to endless puzzles: Why is there something rather than nothing? Why does the universe contain not only inert matter but also living things? Why does the universe contain human beings? What is the purpose of humanity as a whole? Does the universe itself have a telos to which humanity contributes? And so on. Although such questions might be interesting to ponder in one's idle or more speculative moments, I don't find them very productive of creating meaning in your own life, in the lives of the people you care about, or in your community.</p>
<p>Naturally, your mileage might vary. :-)</p>

<h2><a href="1706.html">The Rules of Friendship</a></h2>
<h3>2022-03-22</h3>
<p>While doing some research recently on relationships, I came across an old but classic scholarly paper entitled "The Rules of Friendship" by Michael Argyle and Monika Henderson (<cite>Journal of Social and Personal Relationships</cite>, Vol. 1 (1984), pp. 211-237). Using populations from Britain, Italy, Hong Kong, and Japan, the authors studied several related topics:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the most important "rules of engagement" for friendship?</li>
<li>Which rules determine whether the friendship remains ordinary or becomes close?</li>
<li>Which rules determine whether the friendship survives or lapses?</li>
</ol>
<p>Their findings were consistent with common sense but quite interesting.</p>
<p>On the first topic, they identified three general rules that apply to all friendships (in addition to basic things that Aristotle and others identified 2000+ years ago, such as "spend time with your friends"):</p>
<ul>
<li>Repay each other's debts and favors</li>
<li>Tolerate each other's friends</li>
<li>Don't nag each other</li>
</ul>
<p>On the second topic, they identified six rules that determine whether the friendship advances from ordinary to close:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share news of each other's successess</li>
<li>Strive to make each other happy when together</li>
<li>Stand up for each other when apart</li>
<li>Volunteer to help each other in times of need</li>
<li>Support each other emotionally</li>
<li>Trust and confide in each other</li>
</ul>
<p>On the third topic, they identified four rules that, if violated, tend to break up the friendship: </p>
<ul>
<li>Don't criticize each other in public</li>
<li>Keep each other's confidences</li>
<li>Don't be jealous or critical of each other's relationships</li>
<li>Respect each other's privacy</li>
</ul>
<p>There's more in the paper itself, including the results for 11 distinct hypotheses proposed by the authors. I'm also curious to see if this study has been replicated or extended in more recent psychological literature. However, this brief summary is already long enough, so I'll need to post about friendship again some other time.</p>

<h2><a href="1705.html">The Self as an Achievement</a></h2>
<h3>2022-03-16</h3>
<p>What is the self? Naturally this question invokes vast reflections spanning philosophy, psychology, cognitive science, sociology, biology, and many other fields. Although I claim no special insight, in my Aristotle readings over the last few years I chanced upon a fascinating perspective that I thought I'd share.</p>
<p>In her book <cite>Aristotle's Philosophy of Friendship</cite> (SUNY Press, 1995), Suzanne Stern-Gillet observed that Aristotle's famous analysis of a friend as "another self" implies that <em>the self is not a natural endowment but a personal achievement</em>.</p>
<p>Specifically, Aristotle argued that someone who is thoroughly impulsive is buffeted about in many directions and lacks the consistency of thought, desire, action, and emotion necessary to have a self in the first place. Similarly, he argued that someone who is thoroughly corrupted or vicious has strayed so far from the innate potentials of being human as to also lack true selfhood. (We find a similar thought in J.S. Mill: "One whose desires and impulses are not his own, has no character, no more than a steam-engine has a character.")</p>
<p>For us moderns this is counter-intuitive, because we think that nothing is more natural than the self. We also see selfhood and personhood as intimately connected, and with good reason we're leery of saying that someone isn't really a person! Furthermore, we tend to think of the self as a bundle of whatever thoughts, desires, actions, and emotions someone happens to have; this is why we also tend to think that someone who acts to satisfy their desires is selfish.</p>
<p>By contrast, ancient Greek thinkers like Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, and even Epicurus held that one's desires are not arbitrary urges to be unthinkingly satisfied but raw materials to be pruned, moulded, shaped, and sculpted through a process of education; only thus could one live a fully human life. Therefore someone who acted to satisfy their desires wasn't necessarily building up their selfhood or personhood - it all depended on whether those desires were informed by deliberation and reflection. Enter the importance of philosophy as a way of life.</p>
<p>As always I don't claim to have the final answer (is there such a thing?), but I think the question is eminently worth pondering.</p>

<h2><a href="1704.html">How Much Is Enough?</a></h2>
<h3>2022-03-06</h3>
<p>As mentioned in my post "Delphic Wisdom and Modern Science", on the walls of the ancient Greek temple at Delphi could be found the inscription μηδὲν ἄγαν, meaning "nothing too much". Yet how can one know how much is enough? Naturally it's hard to say precisely - after all, if it were easy, life wouldn't be so messy and complicated, now would it?</p>
<p>One clue comes a discussion of natural vs. unnatural wealth in Aristotle's <cite>Politics</cite> (Book I, Chapters 8 and 9). For Aristotle, natural wealth consists in the possessions necessary for life and useful for association in a community or household (in modern times we might also include corporations and charities). Here, the activity of acquisition has a natural limit determined by and subordinate to the purpose or telos of human life, especially what Aristotle calls living well or eudaimonia.</p>
<p>By contrast, unnatural wealth has lost its moorings in the purpose of human life and has taken on a life of its own. Here, acquisition becomes an end in itself and knows no limits. Thus it's impossible to say how much is enough: an individual or family or corporation or state keeps acquiring and acquiring for no greater or higher human purpose.</p>
<p>This same line of thinking applies to various other things that Aristotle calls external goods: not only wealth and possessions, but also power, reputation, social status, even friends (not to mention particular goods from kitchen gadgets to smartphone apps) can be acquired without regard to the aims of living a good human life. Yet he argued that this drive for acquisition does not lead to greater happiness or meaning in life, precisely because it is unlimited. As psychologists would say these days, the hedonic treadmill never ends. Thus it's better to step off the treadmill, educate your desires, and learn how to live well. Easier said than done, of course!</p>

<h2><a href="1703.html">Read the Eternities</a></h2>
<h3>2022-02-27</h3>
<p>One of my favorite Thoreau aphorisms goes like this: "Read not the Times; read the Eternities." Yet in times of turmoil - war, revolution, depression, pandemic, and the like - it can be difficult to focus on the timeless questions of how to live well because merely living take precedence. On the other hand, there's invariably something bad happening somewhere, and it's difficult to draw the line between what requires urgent attention and what is an ephemeral distraction or news-industry sensation.</p>
<p>Justifiably, in the last week all eyes have been on the reprehensible actions of an authoritarian thug whose conscript armies have invaded a neighboring country without provocation. Unfortunately, at some level turmoil is one of the eternities of human existence. How does one best manage oneself in such situations?</p>
<p>For the last eight years or more I've been on a low-information diet so that I can concentrate my energies where I can directly make a difference (family, friends, team, community, etc.). Even when major events occur in the world, I strictly limit how much attention I give them and instead try to think clearly about their fundamental causes (e.g., it might be time to re-read Thucydides' <cite>History</cite> or Eric Hoffer's <cite>True Believer</cite>) and their implications for how I should live. Although these implications might be eminently practical (e.g., stocking up on essential supplies, helping family and friends, volunteering in my community), I try not only to react but also to reflect and to act deliberately.</p>
<p>Not that I always manage myself perfectly - far from it. And let it be noted that after the Civil War broke out, Thoreau followed the news from the battlefront as closely as anyone else! Thus I'll end with two aphorisms of my own devising: although it's true that "there's no monopoly on hypocrisy", it's also true "you don't have to achieve an ideal to realize the benefits of idealism".</p>
