<h2><a href="1996.html">Biscuit Wood</a></h2>
<h3>2025-10-02</h3>
<p>With winter preparations already underway here (I don't want to get caught flatfooted as happened last year when we were hit with three feet of snow in the first week of November), I was reminded of a story that Henry David Thoreau related in his journal on December 15th, 1859:</p>
<blockquote>Philosophy is a Greek word by good rights, and it stands almost for a Greek thing. Yet some rumor of it has reached the commonest mind. M. Miles, who came to collect his wood-bill today, said, when I objected to the small size of his wood, that it was necessary to split wood fine in order to cure it well, that he had found that wood that was more than four inches in diameter would not dry, and moreover a good deal depended on the manner in which it was corded up in the woods. He piled his high and tightly. If this were not well done the stakes would spread and the wood lie loosely, and so the rain and snow find their way into it. And he added, "I have handled a good deal of wood, and I think that I understand the <em>philosophy</em> of it."</blockquote>
<p>During my youth growing up in Maine, I too handled a good deal of wood, for we mostly heated our house by means of two woodstoves and I was responsible for hand-splitting the 6-8 cords of firewood we burned every winter. Based on my experience, I concur with Thoreau's neighbor about splitting the wood fine. The old-timers called this "biscuit wood" because the finely-split wood burned hot in the cookstove, thus enabling one to bake biscuits at 500+ËšF. (Or at least such was my understanding - my Dutch mother didn't make American-style biscuits!)</p>
<p>Come to think of it, don't most of the practical aspects of life have an associated philosophy? There is beautiful wisdom to be gained and passed on about chopping firewood, baking bread, canning, knitting, gardening, carpentry, and countless other skills and crafts. Perhaps these prosaic forms of philosophy are more directly meaningful in life than the endless speculating and professing that goes on in academic settings...</p>

<h2><a href="1995.html">Bushwhacking</a></h2>
<h3>2025-10-01</h3>
<p>One of the differences, I'm finding, between public philosophy and private philosophy is that the former is full of well-established trails, whereas the latter is largely an unexplored territory in which bushwhacking is required if you want to blaze a path to wisdom. For instance, there are probably hundreds of books on a typical public philosophy topic like free will vs. determinism, whereas there are few if any about, say, understanding and navigating the varieties of grieving.</p>
<p>In the many years that I worked on Internet protocols, we used to distinguish between clear-cut problem spaces and messy problem spaces. For instance, encryption is a clear-cut problem space: either an attacker can eavesdrop on communication or they can't. By contrast, internationalization (a.k.a. i18n) is a messy problem space because of the hundreds of languages and writing scripts we humans use, the serious potential for ambiguity and confusion depending on context, etc. Since I worked on both encryption and internationalization, I can attest that problems in both spaces can be hard to solve, but they're hard in different ways.</p>
<p>Similarly, private philosophy strikes me as much messier than public philosophy because it's rife with confusing ambiguities, contextual subtleties, difficult tradeoffs, emotional entanglements, and other factors that militate against the application of clear-cut rules.</p>
<p>This might be why philosophers have traditionally shied away from the private and the personal, leaving such matters to novelists and psychologists. Having just read a beautifully insightful novel by Willa Cather, and having read my share of the psychological literature over the years, I greatly appreciate what novelists and psychologists bring to the table. Even so, I've always felt that, at its best, philosophy too can make unique contributions to the great task of living: an emphasis not just on personality but also on character development and ethical aspiration, well-reasoned examination of alternative perspectives, a drive toward wisdom and sagacity, pursuit of profound meaning, and a high-minded idealism about human potential and human fulfillment.</p>
<p>Trying to understand these matters for myself while bushwhacking through the undergrowth of life is, however, quite a challenge. Thankfully the task is made easier because of interaction with those who are dear to me, both living loved ones (you know who you are) and a variety of "ancient friends" (Aristotle, Shakespeare, Montaigne, Thoreau, George Eliot, Willa Cather, etc.). It also helps that, no matter how dense the thickets may be, eventually the sky above will always clear to a pure and crystalline blue.</p>

<h2><a href="1994.html">Varieties of Grieving</a></h2>
<h3>2025-09-29</h3>
<p>A few years ago I read an excellent book entitled <cite>Grief: A Philosophical Guide</cite> by Michael Cholbi. Since then, events in my life have led me to reflect further on the several varieties of grieving experience, as William James might have phrased it. Foremost in my mind are anticipatory grief (mental, emotional, and spiritual adjustment to a future loss, such as loss of parents) and ambiguous grief (adjustment to a loss that is difficult to understand or resolve, such as a loved one's incapacitation because of dementia).</p>
<p>As Cholbi so ably explores, in all such situations the relationship you have with a loved one continues, but it is drastically changed. Although this is most stark when your loved one dies, the experience can be just as vivid when your loved one loses abilities and memories, undergoes personality changes, and the like. Your loved one is still present in your life, but in diminished ways; your love, too, is still present, but its foundations can start to feel wobbly if in important respects your loved one is no longer the person they once were.</p>
<p>Given that a relationship is so thoroughly bound up with the lifelong conversation you have with one you love, it can be especially disconcerting when that conversation sharply narrows in scope, shifts in its emotional tone, or otherwise loses its depth and vibrancy. What forever felt like solid ground is now uncertain, precarious, unfamiliar. It's heartbreaking when you can no longer share thoughts and feelings as you once did, make plans together, confide in each other, seek each other's counsel, and engage in many other activities of a shared life.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the term "anticipatory grief" doesn't quite hit the mark. This grieving process isn't something you'll encounter in the future: it's right here and right now. What perhaps makes it especially difficult is that while we humans have well-defined rituals for the ultimate loss of a loved one, we lack them for the progressive losses along the way; moreover, the subtle emotions involved are harder to put into words and thus less easily communicated to friends and family. Yet the losses involved, although not ultimate, are no less final.</p>
<p>Circumstances such as these can give rise to deep questions. What are my responsibilities now, knowing that our mutual investment in each other will become ever less reciprocal? What is the beautifully right way for me to act in this changed relationship? How can I best give care to one I love? Indeed, from the widest perspective, what is love, and what is its constitutive role in life's fulfillment?</p>
<p>These are urgent philosophical questions of a profoundly personal and private nature, are they not?</p>

<h2><a href="1993.html">Sagehood</a></h2>
<h3>2025-09-23</h3>
<p>In most of the ancient philosophical communities, the figure of the sage was held up as the ideal to which a budding lover of wisdom should rightly aspire. This was true of Confucianism, Pythagoreanism, Stoicism, Buddhism, Taoism, Pyrrhonism, Epicureanism, and the various "schools" inspired by the example of Socrates, including the "think tanks" and voluminous works of Plato and Aristotle.</p>
<p>Two questions immediately arise, which I've been pondering for years:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What is sagacity?</li>
  <li>Is sagehood a reasonable ideal?</li>
</ol>
<p>These questions might be unanswerable, but the lifelong endeavor to answer them might itself constitute part of what sagacity is all about.</p>
<p>Following Aristotle, I might say that sagacity is something like "wisdom plus". By wisdom I mean phronÄ“sis, often translated as "practical wisdom": at root, a combination of good judgment and good character. However, as hinted in my post the other day about private philosophers, sagacity seems to be more than action-oriented wisdom, since it involves a deep understanding of the human condition for the sake of sheer awareness and insight. Clearly there is a great deal to unpack here and I don't claim to fully grok the nature and significance of sagacity in human life, but this is my provisional conception.</p>
<p>Can a person attain sagacity? The Stoics, for instance, thought that almost no one could become a sage (perhaps once in a hundred or a thousand years a sage would appear). I'm more optimistic, but that's because I don't think sagehood requires absolute, Platonic perfection without any minor slip-ups in thinking, feeling, or action. Yet just because sagehood might be achievable doesn't mean it's a reasonable ideal - certainly not for everyone, and perhaps only for a few.</p>
<p>To provide a more personal perspective (because, after all, I'm pretty much a personalist), sagacity has long been one of my overarching goals in life, perhaps ever since I stopped believing in god half a century ago when I was nine years old. Of course, I might not be a reasonable person, but the quest for sagacity has been thoroughly enjoyable and fulfilling for me, so I don't plan to ever give it up.</p>

<h2><a href="1992.html">Philosophers: Public and Private</a></h2>
<h3>2025-09-17</h3>
<p>We're all familiar with public intellectuals: prominent thinkers who cross over from merely academic research to have an impact on the broader culture through popular books, public debates, influence on government policy, and so on.</p>
<p>Among public intellectuals, some are philosophers; examples might include Peter Singer, Martha Nussbaum, and in previous generations people like Hannah Arendt, Bertrand Russell, John Dewey, William James, and Ralph Waldo Emerson.</p>
<p>This phenomenon set me to thinking about what it might mean to be a <em>private</em> intellectual or a <em>private</em> philosopher. It seems to me that the opposite of someone who seeks and has a public impact isn't someone who toils silently in academia, but someone who seeks and has a private, personal impact. Because I have no desire to be famous, being a "private philosopher" would have definite appeal - if I could figure out what that phrase means. Here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Take a reflective approach to my projects and activities (even if they are outside the discipline of philosophy per se).</li>
  <li>Regularly reflect on and improve my behaviors, habits, actions, and commitments.</li>
  <li>Ponder the philosophical aspects and implications of a wide range of human endeavors (e.g., current events, technological developments, cultural trends, science, art, music).</li>
  <li>Read widely in philosophy, literature, psychology, history, religion, and the like.</li>
  <li>Continually work to clarify my thinking processes, question and shed unwarranted beliefs, moderate my opinions, become more reasonable, etc.</li>
  <li>Provide wise counsel (when requested or appropriate!) to my friends, family members, colleagues, neighbors, and other people I interact with.</li>
  <li>Mentor younger people to help them succeed in life.</li>
  <li>Gain an ever deeper understanding of the human condition and how to become better at the task of being human.</li>
</ul>
<p>To my mind, these activities and others seem bound up with a quest for sagacity, but that's a large topic for another day...</p>

<h2><a href="1991.html">American Identity</a></h2>
<h3>2025-09-17</h3>
<p>Because today is Constitution Day, I figured it would appropriate to share a few reflections on what it is to be an American. Apparently that's a thing these days! But in fact it's been a thing since at least 1781, when J. Hector St. Jean de Crevecoeur published his essay <cite>What Is an American</cite>.</p>
<p>Coincidently, before learning that this is a hot topic, my recent reading had already included a book by John Kouwenhoven entitled <cite>The Beer Can by the Highway: Essays on What's American about America</cite>, first published in 1961. Kouwenhoven's work is mentioned with fair frequency by Albert Murray, whose own insights are quite relevant to the matter at hand.</p>
<p>The results of a recent YouGov poll indicate that people think the most important factors in considering whether someone is an American are obeying U.S. laws, supporting the U.S. Constitution, and believing in the principles of the Declaration of Independence. That's not a bad start because the Declaration and the Constitution are the intellectual heritage of all Americans, but it seems to me (and seemed to Kouwenhoven and Murray) that American identity goes deeper than that.</p>
<p>Murray held that "the basic elements of American behavior" are "improvisation, frontier experience, resilience"; it is this attitude of affirmation in the face of adversity that has brought about "the orchestration of a veritable jam session of dissonant colonial voices into a constitutional democracy" (isn't that a beautiful image?). Similarly, Kouwenhoven wrote that America is not a finished product but an ever-changing process of aliveness: a flexible way of handling experience rather than a fixed and immutable ideal (not even the ideal expressed in the Declaration, which you'll note is all about the <em>pursuit</em> of happiness rather than a particular outcome that applies to everyone). The music of America is, as Whitman put it in one of the central poems of <cite>Leaves of Grass</cite>, the song of the open road.</p>
<p>Indeed, it strikes me that we Americans are not an ethnos - not a <em>people</em> in the sense that the Danes or Egyptians or Koreans or Ukrainians are a people. Aside from the long-suffering American Indians, no American's ancestors were here more than 400 years years ago; and most Americans' ancestors are a mongrel mix of folks from all over the planet. As Murray once put it, Americans are citizens of the world because the world came to America; or as Kouwenhoven once put it, Americans aren't rooted in one place or ethnicity but culturally are perpetually on the move down Walt Whitman's open road, or perhaps Mark Twain's ever-flowing Mississippi River.</p>
<p>Because old man river just keeps rolling along, immigrants the world over are forever welcome to put in and paddle downstream as they add their thoughts, commitments, art, music, foods, deeds, and lifeways to the great stream that is American culture and the American future.</p>
<p>Yes, America has great ideals and foundations, but it's our never-ending process of living up to those ideals and building atop those foundations that makes American identity so distinctive in world history. Or so it seems to me.</p>
