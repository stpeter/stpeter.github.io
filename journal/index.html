<h2><a href="1758.html">Metaphysics in Verse</a></h2>
<h3>2023-01-12</h3>
<p>One of the things I do to avoid exposure to the news is immerse myself in poetry. Most recently I've been reading English and American poets from the 1500s and 1600s, such as Anne Bradstreet, Samuel Daniel, and Thomas Traherne. At the same time, I've started an intensive re-reading of Aristotelian texts and commentary in preparation for writing an epitome of Aristotle's views on human flourishing. Putting the two together can yield some intriguing combinations!</p>
<p>For instance, I've been pondering the very beginning of Aristotle's <cite>Metaphysics</cite>, which in the classic translation by W.D. Ross is rendered as follows:</p>
<blockquote>All men by nature desire to know. An indication of this is the delight we take in our senses; for even apart from their usefulness they are loved for themselves; and above all others the sense of sight. For not only with a view to action, but even when we are not going to do anything, we prefer seeing (one might say) to everything else. The reason is that this, most of all the senses, makes us know and brings to light many differences between things.</blockquote>
<p>To make it more memorable, I decided to cast it into old-style verse, and here's what came out:</p>
<blockquote>
All human beings yearn to know;<br>
'Tis nature that doth make it so:<br>
Our mind and soul are such that hence<br>
We joy in each and various sense.<br>
But most of all we truly prize<br>
The evidence that, through our eyes,<br>
Doth never cease us to amaze<br>
And ever draws our loving gaze.
</blockquote>
<p>Although I'm no Lucretius, these lines were fun to play with.</p>

<h2><a href="1757.html">Growing into One's Nature</a></h2>
<h3>2023-01-05</h3>
<p>Existentialist philosophers insist on the ability - indeed, the responsibility - for human beings to create themselves. This is the import of Sartre's famous formulation "existence precedes essence": there is no human essence, and if you believe so then you are engaging in "bad faith" and living inauthentically.</p>
<p>Given all that we have discovered so far about human biology, psychology, and ethology over the last 75 years, these existentialist notions seem rather quaint. Yet even humanistic psychologists who in those days were significantly influenced by the existentialists recognized that Sartre and his ilk had gone too far. Consider this passage from an unpublished manuscript by Abraham Maslow (quoted on page 374 of Scott Barry Kaufman's recent book <cite>Transcend: The New Science of Self-Actualization</cite>):</p>
<blockquote>Aristotle, Spinoza, Aquinas and others have stressed as a basic law of all being that everything has a tendency and a right to persist in its own nature. The human species has [as] a "species-specific character" the peculiarity that "persisting in its own nature" is a long slow process of <em>growing</em> into one's own nature. It takes a lifetime to become fully-human, i.e., it takes a lifetime for a baby to persist and [become] its own nature ... essence is potential and therefore has to be actualized, made.</blockquote>
<p>Yes, there is much that we can create about our lives, but there are limits. As Aristotle would say, we are social beings, linguistic beings, thinking beings, enculturated beings. Two quotes from Aristotle's <cite>Politics</cite> are illustrative. First: "He who is unable to live in society, or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast or a god." (1253a27–29) Second: "What each thing is when fully developed we call its nature." (1252b32-33) Plus, of course, all of our concepts related to "actualization" of "potentials" - or, as I prefer to phrase it, "activation" of "capacities" - comes straight out of Aristotle's metaphysics and biology. This will be a major theme of my forthcoming book <cite>Complete Thyself: Aristotle on Human Fulfillment</cite>.</p>

<h2><a href="1756.html">Goodness Trumps Uniqueness</a></h2>
<h3>2022-12-29</h3>
<p>Advocates of modern eudaimonism and the "true self" place great value on individual uniqueness. Consider David L. Norton in his 1976 book <cite>Personal Destinies</cite> (p. 16):</p>
<blockquote>According to self-actualization ethics it is every person's primary responsibility first to discover the daimon [on p. 5 equated with the "true self"] within him and thereafter to live in accordance with it. Because perfection is incompatible with the conditions of existence, one's daimon can never be fully actualized in the world, but by living in truth to it one's unique perfection can be progressively approached.</blockquote>
<p>Later in the same book, Norton asserts that "the moral necessity in 'what must be done' rests in the conviction of a 'something which I, alone, can do'" (p. 189).</p>
<p>But it's not only philosophers who prize uniqueness: some years ago Roland Fryer discovered that, in the 1990s, 228 babies born in California were given the name "Unique" (and to increase the uniqueness factor one was named "Uneek", one "Uneque", and one "Uneqqee").</p>
<p>Yet how important is uniqueness really? The focus on uniqueness reminds me of marketing claims such as "the best Detroit pizza restaurant in Biloxi" - perhaps true, but ultimately meaningless. Plus, does your plumber or dentist need to be unique, or merely good at what they do? Does your neighbor need to be unique, or merely good?</p>
<p>Even further, the drive for uniqueness could lead one seriously astray. Here's Norton again (p. 156): "the implicit end of every actual life is equivalent in worth to every other; specifically it is the perfection of every worth of its unique kind." Yet that perfection might be morally suspect; even Norton, invoking a famous example from Leibniz, observes that "betrayal is the essence of Judas, and the perfection of Judas is the perfection of betrayal"!</p>
<p>If the end game is celebrating the "perfection" of Judas and the like, then uniqueness cannot be a primary value in human life. Goodness trumps uniqueness.</p>

Forster, Robert Herrick, Hesiod, Robert Hillyer, Langston Hughes, David Hume, Henrik Ibsen, William James, Robinson Jeffers, Ben Jonson, Emma Lazarus, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Lucretius, Christopher Marlowe, Herman Melville, John Stuart Mill, John Milton, Michel de Montaigne, Kakuzo Okakura, Richard Overton, Walter Pater, Plutarch, Sir Walter Raleigh, Laura Riding, Edwin Arlington Robinson, Bertrand Russell, William Shakespeare, Sophocles, Baruch Spinoza, Wallace Stevens, Sara Teasdale, Henry David Thoreau, Leo Tolstoy, Virgil, Voltaire, George Washington, John Greenleaf Whittier, and Xenophon. Whew!</p>
<p>Although I make no promises for 2023 because I have several large projects underway, I expect to republish a number of additional works, albeit perhaps at a slower pace.</p>

<h2><a href="1753.html">Approaching Excellence</a></h2>
<h3>2022-12-21</h3>
<p>Aristotle is famous for his so-called doctrine of the mean: a particular excellence of character is not the opposite of a single fault (e.g., courage vs. cowardice) but is intermediate between excess and defect (e.g., courage is opposed to both rashness and cowardice). Although some scholars never go deeper than this surface understanding, as I see it "that which is intermediate" (τὸ μέσον) is merely a first approximation to excellence, because there's an awful lot of space in the middle between going far beyond the mean and falling far short of it.</p>
<p>Within this large realm of the intermediate, then, a second approximation in a given situation might be "that which is appropriate or fitting" (τὸ πρέπον). This is likely what Aristotle had in mind when in Book II, Chapter 9 of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> he said:</p>
<blockquote>Anyone can get angry — that is easy — or give or spend money; but to do this to the right person, to the right extent, at the right time, with the right motive, and in the right way, that is not for every one, nor is it easy.</blockquote>
<p>(Actually, all those instances of the word "right" from W.D. Ross's translation aren't in the original Greek at line 1109a28, which in Aristotle's usual compressed style reads only "but to whom and how much and when and for what sake and how".)</p>
<p>Yet "that which is appropriate" doesn't sound very inspiring, does it? Perhaps, then, a third approximation to excellence is "that which is beautifully right" (τὸ καλόν), for throughout his ethical works Aristotle emphasizes that the deeply virtuous person acts for the sake of τὸ καλόν. Think, for instance, of a time when someone you know not only did an intermediate thing or an appropriate thing but did something that had an stunning beauty or ineluctable rightness about it: a gift, a compliment, a decision, a remark, an action that was simply magnificent or utterly felicitous or deeply honorable or, as Aristotle says, beautifully right.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a high standard to reach, when we are able. But it just might be the height to which Aristotle calls us.</p>
