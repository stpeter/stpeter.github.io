<h2><a href="1842.html">The Old Way</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-23</h3>
<p>In her book <cite>The Old Way</cite>, Elizabeth Marshall Thomas provides a poignant portrait of the hunter-gatherer way of life, based on her "first contact" experience with the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert in the early 1950s. Her account contains many fascinating aspects, such as her description of how the Bushmen groups of ~25 people had no leader but instead made decisions by consensus. She calls their knowledge, customs, and skills "The Old Way" because she contends that we humans evolved into that way of life over hundreds of thousands (perhaps even millions) of years after we split from chimpanzees and the climate of much of Africa changed from rain forest to savannah. When you consider that humans lived as hunter-gatherers for tens of thousands of generations, that we have lived as agriculturalists for perhaps only a few thousand generations, and that we have lived in industrial society for only a dozen or so generations, you start to realize the vast scale of human evolution and the deep foundations for how we think and behave - as well as the extraordinary novelty of our modern way of life. It's no surprise, then, that it's all too easy for us, whether individually or collectively, to retrogress into tribalism. Yet it seems to me that modern tribalism has all the worst features of The Old Way and none of the many features that redeemed it and indeed made it absolutely necessary for human survival until ten thousand years ago or so. In fact, what we think of as tribalism seems to have more in common with the hierarchical societies based on status, power, and wealth that emerged after the hunter-gatherer way of life broke down, and less on the egalitarian societies of The Old Way. As Bob Marley once sang, "If you knew your history, then you would know where you're coming from."</p>

<h2><a href="1841.html">Short Shrift</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-19</h3>
<p>Riffing on a post by Arnold Kling, who in turn was riffing on Marc Andreessen, I've been pondering the topics that various schools of thought tend to ignore. Kling was talking about politics: conservatives don't like to discuss beneficial social changes they once opposed, progressives don't like to consider anything but oppression as a cause of disparate outcomes, etc. However, we can apply the same line of thinking to philosophies. Here are a few possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aristotelians give short shrift to moral rules and behavioral policies.</li>
<li>Kantians give short shrift to character traits and the outcomes of action.</li>
<li>Utilitarians give short shrift to personal relationships and character traits.</li>
<li>Stoics give short shrift to emotions and the irreplaceable value of loved ones.</li>
<li>Epicureans give short shrift to the socio-political environment in which one lives.</li>
<li>Confucians give short shrift to spontaneity and living in the moment.</li>
<li>Taoists give short shrift to deliberation and planning for the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on. It'd be a worthwhile exercise to think this through more fully.</p>

<h2><a href="1840.html">Do We Need the Concept of a Concept?</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-18</h3>
<p>As mentioned last month, I'm slowly re-reading Robert Sokolowski's book <cite>Phenomenology of the Human Person</cite> with a friend of mine. When I first wrote about this book four years ago, I noted that Sokolowski "explains the epistemology of reason in the context of human conversation: by embracing the back and forth of speech ... he sidesteps the ever present dangers of solipsism and mental representationalism." As a point of comparison, in her book <cite>Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology</cite>, Ayn Rand says that a child independently formulates the concept of, say, a tree in his or her own mind by observing trees in reality. However, on this account we need to add communication as a separate capacity on top of concept-formation so that we can explain how the child associates the word 'tree' with the concept.</p>
<p>By contrast, Sokolowski says that we English-speakers simply use the word 'tree' to talk about the trees we encounter and the child naturally learns to use the word because that's what other English-speakers say. As a result, we don't need the concept of a concept, which is merely another kind of mental representation - and, according to Sokolowski, such representations don't exist. Thus philosophical parsimony might lead us to strike concepts from our talk about how we understand what we know. I see quite a bit of sense in what he says, so I've been trying the idea on for size.</p>
<p>Ironically, Sokolowski goes on say that words serve to focus the mind on reality, yet it seems to me this assumes that somehow there is a <em>thing</em> called the mind inside us - and I've previously noted that I have my doubts about that position.</p>
<p>Yes, reification is hard to avoid...</p>

<h2><a href="1839.html">Philosophy vs. Philosophies</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-14</h3>
<p>On the very first page of his book <cite>What Is Ancient Philosophy?</cite>, Pierre Hadot — the late French scholar who almost singlehandedly resurrected the humanistic conception of philosophy as a way of life — drew a distinction between individual philosophies on the one hand and philosophy itself on the other:</p>
<blockquote>
Seldom do we reflect upon what philosophy is in itself. Indeed, it is extremely difficult to define it. What philosophy students are introduced to is above all <em>philosophies</em>.... In itself, there is nothing wrong with all this. It certainly seems that the way one can come to have an idea of <em>philosophy</em> is by studying <em>philosophies</em>. Yet the history of "philosophy" is not the same as the history of philosophies, if what we understand by "philosophies" are theoretical discourses and philosophers' systems. In addition to this history, however, there is room for the study of philosophical modes of life.
</blockquote>
<p>Here is one way to think about it: loving and practicing wisdom is not the same thing as adhering to a worldview. The aim of wisdom is self-mastery and self-knowledge, i.e., both serious self-examination as a central, organizing activity of your life and the development of deep "mindedness", intentionality, understanding, and insight as abiding traits of your thinking and character. By contrast, if you consider yourself to be primarily an adherent of a worldview, then your allegiance to the love and practice of wisdom is only secondary, and can be successful only to the extent that the worldview to which adhere truly values wisdom. Not all of them do: consider, for example, the very idea of utilitarianism as a way of life; as a rule-based ethical system, it doesn't really value wisdom and character as first-class concerns (of which, to my mind, the failures of Effective Altruism are merely the most recent manifestation).</p>
<p>It seems to me that the aspiration to be a philosopher is rooted in an existential commitment to live an examined life and to pursue truth wherever it may lead. By contrast, the aspiration to be, say, a loyal and consistent Stoic or Buddhist is rooted intellectually in accepting that worldview as final truth and emotionally in feeling the comfort of feeling that fundamentally your search for truth is over. To put it metaphorically: while the adherent sighs contentedly as he settles into his comfortable home, the explorer shoulders his pack to track the trail of truth over the next mountain range.</p>
<p>That said, I do think that a person can become wise within the narrower scope of a well-defined worldview; however, it might require more time and even some cognitive dissonance as the adherent tries to bend that worldview to deal with the messy realities of life. This might be easier in long-lived traditions like Confucianism and Christianity that contain competing strands of thought (e.g., the Augustinian and Thomistic strands of Christianity), since that enables the adherent to pick and choose different emphases to suit the demands of particular situations.</p>

<h2><a href="1838.html">More on Ancient Friends</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-13</h3>
<p>A mere two nights after quoting Niccolò Machiavelli's reflections on his ancient friends, I came upon a similar passage in <cite>Essays in Idleness</cite>, written by the Japanese poet-monk Yoshida Kenkō around the year 1330. Here's what Kenkō had to say, in the translation by Donald Keene:</p>
<blockquote>
The pleasantest of all diversions is to sit alone under the lamp, a book spread out before you, and to make friends with people of a distant past you have never known. The books I would choose are the moving volumes of <cite>Wen Hsüan</cite>, the collected works of Po Chü-i, the sayings of Lao Tzu, and the chapters of Chuang Tzu.
</blockquote>
<p>Whereas Machiavelli conversed with ancient Greek and Roman historians like Polybius and Livy, Kenkō befriended Chinese poets and Taoist philosophers. Much as I enjoy history, I give the nod to Kenkō because his preferences align more closely with mine. As Aristotle said in Chapter IX of the <cite>Poetics</cite>: "Poetry is a more philosophical and a higher thing than history: for poetry tends to express the universal, history the particular."</p>

<h2><a href="1837.html">Planning to Be Old</a></h2>
<h3>2023-12-12</h3>
<p>Earlier this year at a family gathering, I overheard an uncle of mine (who is in his late 80s) say something in passing to one of his siblings about the importance of planning to be old. This set me to thinking: what might such planning involve? Here are some possible considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saving and investing well so that you can remain financially solvent late in life</li>
<li>Staying physically active so that you can manage everyday tasks as long as possible</li>
<li>Staying mentally active so that you are sharp enough to handle things like financial decisions as you get older</li>
<li>Staying socially active to ensure your emotional health</li>
<li>Accepting the various pains and annoyances of old age without complaint</li>
<li>Learning to be alone, since if you live long enough you will lose some of the people who are dear to you</li>
<li>Giving back by volunteering in your community</li>
<li>Seeking truth and meaning by continuing to acquire wisdom as long as you live</li>
<li>Sharing some of the wisdom you have gained through mentoring, teaching, or creative pursuits</li>
<li>Leaving a legacy by selecting worthy causes to which you can donate time or money</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these activities require foresight, common sense, and practical wisdom, which too often are lacking in our youth-obsessed, live-for-the-day society. But they are far from impossible to cultivate, so it's best to start now...</p>
