<h2><a href="2004.html">Beauty, Pleasure, Mozart, and Bob Dylan</a></h2>
<h3>2025-11-26</h3>
<p>Since choosing the name Beautiful Wisdom for my Substack earlier this year, I have focused more on wisdom and less on beauty. That might be changing, for several reasons: I've been getting deeper into musical composition, theory, and performance; I've been souring on speculative logorrhea; and in some of my recent readings on aesthetics I've been disappointed with philosophical accounts of beauty.</p>
<p>A case in point regarding the latter is George Santayana's 1896 classic <cite>The Sense of Beauty</cite>. I hasten to mention that I am just getting started with Santayana's vast oeuvre, so I might be misreading him. Unfortunately, right now I find his underlying account of beauty and the arts to be implausible. To wit, Santayana claims that beauty is (aesthetic) pleasure regarded as the quality of a thing: when a person says that an object or experience is beautiful, all they really mean is that it gives them a purely subjective pleasure - which they then shift, with absolutely no justification, onto the object itself and its perceptually salient features (such as color, symmetry, and form). It's almost a kind of aesthetic emotivism; if I say that Michelangelo's David is beautiful, all I really mean is "David Yum!"</p>
<p>If Santayana's account were true, then I could not call something beautiful if I didn't enjoy it, and I could not enjoy something if it weren't beautiful. However, in my experience both of these paradoxical phenomena are not only possible but quite common.</p>
<p>As an example of the first paradox, I recognize that objectively speaking the music of Mozart is quite beautiful: classically balanced, highly melodic, endlessly inventive, and so on. Yet subjectively speaking I concur with Glenn Gould's assessment that most of Mozart's music is so much musical prattle. You might counter that evidently I must be a musical boor: even though I could converse for hours about the wonders of, say, Bach's Cello Suites or Fauré's Nocturnes, I simply <em>should</em> enjoy Mozart. But this aesthetic imperative is even less legitimate than the moral imperatives of Kant or the Stoics.</p>
<p>As an example of the second paradox, I adore the music and, yes, even the singing of Bob Dylan. More evidence of my boorishness! Objectively speaking Dylan's vocal stylings are, at best, an acquired taste; at worst, they are downright grating. Here again you might assert that I simply <em>shouldn't</em> enjoy Dylan's music because it's not beautiful, whereas I again would simply ignore your aesthetic imperatives.</p>
<p>In line with my thoroughgoing particularism, my aesthetic experience is dependent on the individual work at hand, not some hard-and-fast policy that overrides the evidence of my ears and heart. For instance, I'd rather hear Mozart's horn concertos than Dylan's "Idiot Wind" (which to my ear is a decidedly ugly rant set to music).</p>
<p>Where does this leave Santayana? Even though I am not convinced by the foundations of his aesthetic theory, <cite>The Sense of Beauty</cite> contains numerous insights into aesthetic experience, which I am eagerly absorbing as I seek to form my own account of what I'm calling philokalia or the love and practice of beauty.</p>

<h2><a href="2003.html">The Personal Side of Public Behavior</a></h2>
<h3>2025-11-22</h3>
<p>While conversing with a friend the other day about the seemingly endless decline in societal standards of public behavior, I had a realization: there is nothing I can do about how other people conduct themselves; all I can do is conduct myself up to <em>my own</em> standards. This is not a newfound awareness - I can't count the number of times I have observed that the only thing I have control over in life is myself, and even this can be rather tenuous - yet each time I make such an observation my consciousness experiences a little jolt of surprised recognition.</p>
<p>What are the personal standards of public conduct to which I aspire? On reflection, here are few that come to mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Treat every person with dignity. This applies especially to people who work in roles that many folks consider to be purely functional (waitresses, nurses, retail workers, librarians, flight attendants, janitors, customer service representatives, and the like). As an example, many years ago while eating a quick lunch in the Cleveland airport on my way to yet another technology conference, I had a brief conversation with the harried and likely underpaid waitress, making sure to address her by the name on her name tag. She tearfully said it was the first time that any patron had ever used her name!</li>
  <li>Say thanks. Another time while on a flight to some business destination or another, I happened to be sitting in the very back of the plane when I expressed my thanks to the flight attendant for handing me a snack. She in turn thanked me for this minor courtesy and mentioned that no one in the rows ahead of me had said thank you!</li>
  <li>Express empathy. If a person I'm interacting with isn't completely on their game, I try to imagine that perhaps they have recently lost a loved one, are in an abusive relationship, work two jobs, have financial or health problems, or are experiencing something equally difficult. What are my petty troubles compared to theirs?</li>
  <li>Compliment people who deserve it. When someone is especially kind, helpful, polite, elegant, or what have you, I try to compliment them on how they conduct themselves. In a professional context, what's even better is to tell their boss!</li>
</ul>
<p>I describe these principles not to boast about how wonderful I am (I have a long way to go on the path to sagehood!), but to reinforce them in my own mind so that I can live up to them more consistently.</p>

<h2><a href="2002.html">Twenty-Five Years of Blogging</a></h2>
<h3>2025-11-21</h3>
<p>On this day in the year 2000, I posted the first entry in my online journal. Two thousand posts and 650,000+ words later, I'm still at it. Granted, my journal is not quite of Thoreauvian proportions: our friend Henry produced over 2 million words in 24 years of journaling (all of which I read while encountering Thoreau in preparation for composing my book <cite>The Upland Farm</cite>). Even so, I've done a lot of scribbling over the last quarter century!</p>
<p>Here's how I described the nascent endeavor back then:</p>
<blockquote>I see this space as part diary, part sandbox, and part weblog - a place to explore ideas and events on the web, in real life, and in my head. Hopefully someone other than me will find it interesting. :-)</blockquote>
<p>Some things have changed over the last 25 years: for instance, I don't know what makes a "weblog" distinctive now that so much of modern existence has moved from physical to virtual. Moreover, because I'm a pretty private person I have always shied away from treating this journal like a diary. Thus over time I've gravitated mostly to the sandbox model, in which I try ideas on for size and explore the personal implications of my readings and reflections.</p>
<p>To my mind, this journal isn't writing in a professional sense but the simple act of thinking out loud, which I find enormously helpful in pursuit of greater clarity and wisdom as I travel through life. That a few folks seemingly like to listen in on my dialogue with myself means a great deal to me.</p>
<p>Here's to the next 25 years!</p>

<h2><a href="2001.html">Giving and Receiving</a></h2>
<h3>2025-11-16</h3>
<p>Recent life circumstances have spurred me to reflect further on love as an activity, but also on love as a "passivity", as it were.</p>
<p>It strikes me that, at root, the activity of loving consists of freehearted giving, whereas the "passivity" of loving consists of gracious receiving; and, moreover, that there is beautiful nobility in both the giving and the receiving. This nobility is well captured in a poignant scene from Willa Cather's novel <cite>O Pioneers!</cite> (Part II, Chapter XII), wherein our heroine Alexandra has offered financial support to Carl, her childhood friend and intended husband, who replies: "To take what you would give me, I should have to be either a very large man or a very small one, and I am only in the middle class." (In the context, it's clear that Carl is speaking of moral classes, not monetary ones.)</p>
<p>It's noteworthy that the word "take" is used here rather than "receive", for we associate taking with character traits approaching avarice, whereas receiving requires attitudes of thankfulness for the gift and esteem for the giver. This is a significant factor in the nobility of receiving.</p>
<p>As Aristotle emphasizes in his writings on soulcraft, the ideal relationship is deeply reciprocal, characterized by freehearted giving and gracious receiving in both directions. Yet unavoidably there are situations (e.g., illness and convalescence) and times of life (esp. childhood and old age) when one receives more than one gives; philosophers of care and relationships must do justice to these, as for instance many Confucians have done. Furthermore, what's given can be of a different order than what's received; we see this in the very same scene from <cite>O Pioneers!</cite>, where Alexandra says to Carl: "What good comes of offering people things they don't need? I don't need money. But I have needed you for a great many years."</p>
<p>Thinkers as disparate as Aristotle and Nietzsche have long held that giving is more worthy than receiving because giving is more active and flows from an abundance of life and character. Indeed, there is an amusing passage in Aristotle's Ethics wherein he goes back and forth between considering it more noble to oneself do something beautiful or to give a loved one the opportunity to do the beautiful action and thus shine forth in nobility (an internal debate that perhaps only an ancient Greek could engage in!).</p>
<p>Yet, as I say, there is nobility and beauty in graciously receiving, too. There is an analogy here to the arts: the unsurpassed mastery of Sophocles, Michelangelo, Shakespeare, Vermeer, Bach, or Beethoven is a gift of wonder to all mankind, but their artworks possess continued meaning only because millions of human beings have been receptive over the course of centuries to what these artists brought into the world. The same is true of the great philosophers, scientists, reformers, and revolutionaries throughout human history. On a more intimate scale, such influence makes itself felt in every marriage, friendship, workplace, and community.</p>

<h2><a href="2000.html">A Letter</a></h2>
<h3>2025-10-17</h3>
<p>Yesterday I penned a letter to my best friend. And I do mean penned: after rummaging around in a box stashed in a closet, I tracked down some fine stationery I'd bought years ago and, pen in hand, sat down to write. Having been away from letter-writing for decades, I was reminded of a few long-forgotten essentials:</p>
<ol>
<li>Writing a letter by hand is a slow, contemplative activity. The fact that you need to think about what you're going to say before committing it to paper induces a great deal of thought and reflection.</li>
<li>This kind of slow, contemplative writing makes you think with care about the person you're writing to, in two senses: you choose your words carefully so that you can demonstrate the caring thoughts and feelings you have toward this person who is dear to you.</li>
<li>The bodily act of penning a letter leads to a subtle but perceptible embodiment of your thoughts and feelings, for instance in the words you underline or the width of your dashes. Indeed, a writer who is more visually creative than I am might include little doodles, sketch a flower or a cloud, and so on. (Thoreau did this kind of thing in his journal.)</li>
<li>Writing letters is additive; although I talk on the phone with this friend every week or two and text with him nearly every day, writing is an extra mode of communication that does not take away from these more immediately interactive activities.</li>
</ol>
<p>I foresee more letter writing in my future...</p>

<h2><a href="1999.html">Socrates and Thoreau on True Wealth</a></h2>
<h3>2025-10-14</h3>
<p>On this day in 1857, Thoreau wrote as follows in his journal:</p>
<blockquote>Was there ever such an autumn? And yet there was never such a panic and hard times in the commercial world. The merchants and banks are suspending and failing all the country over, but not the sand-banks, solid and warm, and streaked with bloody blackberry vines. You may run upon them as much as you please — even as the crickets do, and find their account in it. They are the stockholders in these banks, and I hear them creaking their content. You may see them on chance any warmer hour. In these banks, too, and such as these, are my funds deposited, a fund of health and enjoyment. Their (the crickets) prosperity and happiness and, I trust, mine do not depend on whether the New York banks suspend or no. We do not rely on such slender security as the thin paper of the Suffolk Bank. To put your trust in such a bank is to be swallowed up and undergo suffocation. Invest, I say, in these country banks. Let your capital be simplicity and contentment.</blockquote>
<p>These thoughts echo something Thoreau wrote on the first of May in that same year:</p>
<blockquote>It is foolish for a man to accumulate material wealth chiefly, houses and land. Our stock in life, our real estate, is that amount of thought which we have had, which we have thought out. The ground we have thus created is forever pasturage for our thoughts. I fall back on to visions which I have had. What else adds to my possessions and makes me rich in all lands? If you have ever done any work with these finest tools, the imagination and fancy and reason, it is a new creation, independent on the world, and a possession forever. You have laid up something against a rainy day. You have to that extent cleared the wilderness.</blockquote>
<p>While perusing Plato's <cite>Apology</cite> recently, I realized that these observations chime with something Socrates said at his trial (here in the translation that Thoreau would have read, Sydenham and Taylor 1804, volume 4, p. 213):</p>
<blockquote>I go about doing nothing else than persuading both the younger and older among you, neither to pay attention to the body, nor to riches, nor anything else prior to the soul; not to be so much concerned for any thing, as how the soul may subsist in the most excellent condition. I also say that virtue is not produced from riches, but riches from virtue, as likewise all other human goods, both privately and publicly.</blockquote>
<p>As previously noted, during his time at Walden Pond Thoreau borrowed this translation of Plato's dialogues from his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson (who also owned the woodlot where Thoreau built his cabin). His masterpiece <cite>Walden</cite> was in many ways an apologia, a defense of his way of life: not the superficialities of his two years at the pond that everyone focuses on these days, but his deep cultivation of simplicity, independence, contentment, magnanimity, wisdom, and other excellences of character. Both Socrates and Thoreau recognized that the true wealth consists not in material possessions, but in the higher riches that only soulcraft can procure for us.</p>
