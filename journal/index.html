<h2><a href="1817.html">Attuning to Beauty</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-22</h3>
<p>When describing recently my practice of daily forethought, I mentioned that every day I try to attune myself to the beauty of the world around me. This might sound pompouse and grandiose because often we associate beauty only with the fine arts, but for me it's much more practical and prosaic. Here are some of the activities I engage in toward this end:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look up at the sky.</li>
<li>Enjoy cloud formations.</li>
<li>Revel in rain, snow, wind, and other weather.</li>
<li>Watch the sun rise and set.</li>
<li>View the moon.</li>
<li>Observe birds and animals and insects.</li>
<li>Look at wildflowers, grasses, and other plants.</li>
<li>Commune with the pine trees on our property.</li>
<li>Walk in nature.</li>
<li>Recognize efficiencies in human society.</li>
<li>Appreciate elegance in human interactions.</li>
<li>Witness ethical magnificence in human actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also read a few poems and listen to lots of music.</p>
<p>Although we tend to think of beauty as just one quality, in fact there are many different kinds of beauty. In his book <cite>The Importance of Living</cite>, Lin Yutang lists a number of them:</p>
<blockquote>There may be beauty of whimsicality and waywardness, beauty of rugged strength, beauty of massive power, beauty of spiritual freedom, beauty of courage and dash, beauty of romantic charm, beauty of restraint, beauty of soft gracefulness, beauty of austerity, beauty of simplicity and "stupidity," beauty of mere regularity, beauty of swiftness, and sometimes even beauty of affected ugliness.</blockquote>
<p>So yes, beauty is all around us if only we know how to attune ourselves to it.</p>

<h2><a href="1816.html">Snares and Attachments</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-23</h3>
<p>Having posted enough semi-political entries of late to last me quite a while, it's time to return to reflections on living.</p>
<p>Among other topics, I've been pondering the many snares and attachments that can prevent us from finding fulfillment in life. Classic snares include fame, status, money, power, and pleasure: the great wisdom traditions have warned us about these for thousands of years. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that we can get attached to a much wider array of things in life:</p>
<ul>
<li>Possessions. Even if you don't have great wealth, you might become attached to the stuff you own. However, as an uncle of mine used to say, "it's just a thing."</li>
<li>Looks. This one applies especially to the beautiful people of the world, whose appearance is their ticket to success. (Yes, lookism is real.)</li>
<li>Health. It's important to take care of your health and be physically fit, but you can go overboard with exercise, diets, supplements, and the like.</li>
<li>Youth. This is similar to both health and looks, yet I see it as a separate snare, especially in a youth-oriented culture like America.</li>
<li>Accomplishments. Ordinarily, your achievements are something to be proud of, but some people get overly attached to them (consider someone whose teenage athletic accomplishments were quite impressive, but who still dwells on them 50 years later).</li>
<li>Dreams. This could be seen as the opposite of accomplishments, since you are focused solely on what you <em>might</em> accomplish in the future.</li>
<li>Ancestry. Isn't it sad when you hear about someone who has a famous ancestor but hasn't done much with their own life?</li>
<li>People. Although folks don't talk much about co-dependency anymore, it's all too easy to get involved in unhealthy relationships, even with people who are quite distant from you (such as obsession with a famous movie star or musician).</li>
<li>Opinions. You don't have to be a member of a cult or movement to allow your identity to be bound up with your beliefs.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure there are more where those came from! I might dig into these more deeply over the coming months...</p>

<h2><a href="1815.html">The Tao of Freedom</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-23</h3>
<p>Many defenses of a free society are based on assumptions of certainty regarding human nature; for instance, human beings are so constituted that they must have maximal autonomy in order to discover scientific truths or invent and produce the goods and services that improve human life.</p>
<p>Less well known are defenses that <em>assume uncertainty</em> regarding the best course of action. As far as I'm aware, the most ancient of these is implicit in philosophical Taoism (see ยง71 of the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite>: "Knowing that you don't know is best; not knowing is a fault of foolishness"). Here one doesn't make a positive claim about human nature, but instead questions the positive claims about public policy made by those who would impose their views on the rest of us.</p>
<p>Far too often, such policies are based on ideology and opinion, not wisdom and experience. To take a recent example, consider the drive in some American cities to radically reduce or completely eliminate policing functions ("defund the police"). Although I don't pay close attention to political wrangling, for me one red flag at the time would have been that the proponents appeared to be awfully, even messianically <em>certain</em> about the correctness of their proposals. In an inherently complex realm like human society, it strikes me that no one who has studied the matter seriously could be so utterly oblivious to the existence of tradeoffs. If it's all pro and no con, I sense a con of a different kind.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, politicians and policy wonks are usually overconfident about the value of their "expert" opinions. If they won't temper their hubris with some much-needed humility, it's our job as citizens to counter their certainty with some well-deserved skepticism.</p>

<h2><a href="1814.html">Wisdom vs. Ideology</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-22</h3>
<p>Following up on my post about Washington's wisdom, I've been thinking about the contrast between wisdom and ideology as a basis for making decisions.</p>
<p>One of the notable facts about George Washington is that he pre-dated the emergence of political parties in America. Indeed, his cabinet included both Alexander Hamilton - a committed federalist - as secretary of the treasury and Thomas Jefferson - a committed republican - as secretary of state. (I deliberately do not capitalize these terms.) Although Washington advocated for a stronger central government, it seems to me that he did so not because he thought that centralization was inherently good, but because of lessons he learned as commander in chief of the Continental Army.</p>
<p>From 1775 through 1782, Washington had to cajole the Continental Congress and the states for soldiers, arms, ammunition, food, uniforms, and everything else an army requires. Most of the time these resources were in dangerously short supply: he didn't have enough soldiers, and what soldiers he had were outgunned, clothed in rags, and chronically hungry. Washington experienced first-hand how extraordinarily difficult it was to prosecute a war with virtually no central authority and no executive function. If he was a federalist, he earned it through hard experience.</p>
<p>Contrast this with both Hamilton and Jefferson. Hamilton apparently never met a central government function, initiative, or tax he didn't like, whereas Jefferson was so suspicious of executive power that he perceived a monarchical conspiracy behind almost everything Washington did as president (all the while making increasingly implausible excuses for the violent excesses of the French Revolution).</p>
<p>This is not to say that the politically moderate Washington had no principles. Far from it: as Ron Chernow notes in his biography, "George Washington possessed the gift of inspired simplicity, a clarity and purity of vision that never failed him. Whatever petty partisan disputes swirled around him, he kept his eyes fixed on the transcendent goals that motivated his quest." Primary among those goals was the founding of an independent republic that was answerable to the American people but unified enough to survive and prosper and take its own place among the nations of the world. Thankfully for us, he had the wisdom, tenacity, and strength of character to chart a course to success under extremely difficult circumstances - a nearly miraculous feat that I believe no one else at the time could have managed because they could not check their ideological opinions (and personal ambitions) well enough to provide the requisite level of leadership.</p>
<p>Principled wisdom trumps ideological purity every time.</p>

<h2><a href="1813.html">Washington's Wisdom</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-18</h3>
<p>Recently I carved out time to read Ron Chernow's 800-page biography of George Washington. We tend to have only vague notions about Washington, but Chernow's biography truly brings him to life. Far from being the wooden, mythical figure we imagine, Washington was a man of great passions and strong emotions, which he worked hard to direct into productive channels throughout his long career in private life and public service.</p>
<p>Washington's strengths were legion. A French military officer observed, perhaps with slight exaggeration, that Washington was "brave without temerity, laborious without ambition, generous without prodigality, noble without pride, virtuous without severity." I'm especially fascinated by Washington's decision making, and how he improved in that regard over time. Apparently he excelled at learning from his mistakes; not only did he welcome honest criticism from others, but he was ruthlessly self-critical as well. First as commander in chief of the Continental Army and then as the founding president of the United States of America, he actively sought out competing opinions from the men on his staff. Yet he didn't rush headlong to figure out the practical truth: as Chernow says, "Washington's inestimable strength, whether as a general, a planter, or a politician, was prolonged deliberation and slow, mature decisions."</p>
<p>Furthermore, Washington held himself to extremely high standards of personal and professional integrity. Whereas a lesser leader could easily have turned dictatorial in such a revolutionary environment, Washington hewed to a stricter path and always deferred to civilian authority as commander in chief and to constitutional principles as president. As Kipling might have said, he kept his head when all about him were losing theirs and blaming it on him: he did not allow himself to be overly impressed with his great successes, nor to seek revenge against critics and rivals who attacked him so incessantly. And yes, as a Virginia planter Washington did own slaves (as did his wife Martha through her first marriage), but he was the only slaveholding Founder who freed his slaves, albeit at the end of his life after long reflection on both the moral evils of slavery and the practicalities of emancipation (such as keeping families together and training his slaves in the skills they would need for a free life).</p>
<p>In sum, I conclude that, although Washington wasn't perfect, overall he was close to an exemplar of the virtue that Aristotle called phronesis or practical wisdom. The contrast with present-day demagogues is as glaring as it is distressing.</p>

<h2><a href="1812.html">Political Animals</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-18</h3>
<p>One of Aristotle's most famous observations is that human beings are "political animals"; yet the meaning of this phrase is not widely understood or appreciated. Let's take a closer look.</p>
<p>Scholars such as R.G. Mulgan and David J. Depew have identified three core senses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Humans have a capacity for self-governance.</li>
<li>Humans often engage in a "citified" way of life.</li>
<li>Humans work cooperatively toward communal goals.</li>
</ol>
<p>According to Aristotle, humans share the third, "zoological" sense with social insects like ants and bees. In all of these species, there is differentiation of activity toward a single end, which is the survival or flourishing of the community. For instance, as entomologist Thomas Seeley has described in a remarkable series of books including <cite>The Life of Bees</cite> and <cite>Honeybee Democracy</cite>, honeybees perform disparate tasks to maintain the nest (somewhat segregated by queen, male drones, and female worker bees), and even engage in a form of democratic decision-making to choose new nesting locations!</p>
<p>Aristotle distinguishes the "political" animals from the "gregarious" or herding animals like cattle and deer. As Depew puts it in his paper <cite>Humans and Other Political Animals in Aristotle's History of Animals</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>Only political animals, among the wider array of gregarious animals, cooperate to achieve "something one and common that is the work of all" (<cite>Historia Animalium</cite> I.1.488a9).... [M]erely gregarious animals separately perform the <em>same</em> activities in physical proximity to others of their kind ... by contrast, political animals perform <em>different</em> activities in the course of engaging in and contributing to a single way of life."</blockquote>
<p>An immediate illustration of this difference is the significance of shared meals in human existence. For instance, as I watch the deer that live near my house, I observe that they all chomp separately on the grasses, but don't otherwise interact much. Compare that to, say, a meal at your favorite restaurant: the employees perform multiple roles, numerous trades built the structure where you sit, and there's a vast supply chain for the food and beverages - all of which is ultimately for the sake of a convivial experience in which the repast itself is merely an excuse for conversation and the enjoyment of your relationship with your tablemates. This example (encompassing language, farming, cooking, economics, customs, forethought, friendship, and much else besides) is the merest indication of how deep sociality runs in human life.</p>
