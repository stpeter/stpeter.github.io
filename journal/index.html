<h2><a href="1993.html">Sagehood</a></h2>
<h3>2025-09-23</h3>
<p>In most of the ancient philosophical communities, the figure of the sage was held up as the ideal to which a budding lover of wisdom should rightly aspire. This was true of Confucianism, Pythagoreanism, Stoicism, Buddhism, Taoism, Pyrrhonism, Epicureanism, and the various "schools" inspired by the example of Socrates, including the "think tanks" and voluminous works of Plato and Aristotle.</p>
<p>Two questions immediately arise, which I've been pondering for years:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What is sagacity?</li>
  <li>Is sagehood a reasonable ideal?</li>
</ol>
<p>These questions might be unanswerable, but the lifelong endeavor to answer them might itself constitute part of what sagacity is all about.</p>
<p>Following Aristotle, I might say that sagacity is something like "wisdom plus". By wisdom I mean phronēsis, often translated as "practical wisdom": at root, a combination of good judgment and good character. However, as hinted in my post the other day about private philosophers, sagacity seems to be more than action-oriented wisdom, since it involves a deep understanding of the human condition for the sake of sheer awareness and insight. Clearly there is a great deal to unpack here and I don't claim to fully grok the nature and significance of sagacity in human life, but this is my provisional conception.</p>
<p>Can a person attain sagacity? The Stoics, for instance, thought that almost no one could become a sage (perhaps once in a hundred or a thousand years a sage would appear). I'm more optimistic, but that's because I don't think sagehood requires absolute, Platonic perfection without any minor slip-ups in thinking, feeling, or action. Yet just because sagehood might be achievable doesn't mean it's a reasonable ideal - certainly not for everyone, and perhaps only for a few.</p>
<p>To provide a more personal perspective (because, after all, I'm pretty much a personalist), sagacity has long been one of my overarching goals in life, perhaps ever since I stopped believing in god half a century ago when I was nine years old. Of course, I might not be a reasonable person, but the quest for sagacity has been thoroughly enjoyable and fulfilling for me, so I don't plan to ever give it up.</p>

<h2><a href="1992.html">Philosophers: Public and Private</a></h2>
<h3>2025-09-17</h3>
<p>We're all familiar with public intellectuals: prominent thinkers who cross over from merely academic research to have an impact on the broader culture through popular books, public debates, influence on government policy, and so on.</p>
<p>Among public intellectuals, some are philosophers; examples might include Peter Singer, Martha Nussbaum, and in previous generations people like Hannah Arendt, Bertrand Russell, John Dewey, William James, and Ralph Waldo Emerson.</p>
<p>This phenomenon set me to thinking about what it might mean to be a <em>private</em> intellectual or a <em>private</em> philosopher. It seems to me that the opposite of someone who seeks and has a public impact isn't someone who toils silently in academia, but someone who seeks and has a private, personal impact. Because I have no desire to be famous, being a "private philosopher" would have definite appeal - if I could figure out what that phrase means. Here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Take a reflective approach to my projects and activities (even if they are outside the discipline of philosophy per se).</li>
  <li>Regularly reflect on and improve my behaviors, habits, actions, and commitments.</li>
  <li>Ponder the philosophical aspects and implications of a wide range of human endeavors (e.g., current events, technological developments, cultural trends, science, art, music).</li>
  <li>Read widely in philosophy, literature, psychology, history, religion, and the like.</li>
  <li>Continually work to clarify my thinking processes, question and shed unwarranted beliefs, moderate my opinions, become more reasonable, etc.</li>
  <li>Provide wise counsel (when requested or appropriate!) to my friends, family members, colleagues, neighbors, and other people I interact with.</li>
  <li>Mentor younger people to help them succeed in life.</li>
  <li>Gain an ever deeper understanding of the human condition and how to become better at the task of being human.</li>
</ul>
<p>To my mind, these activities and others seem bound up with a quest for sagacity, but that's a large topic for another day...</p>

<h2><a href="1991.html">American Identity</a></h2>
<h3>2025-09-17</h3>
<p>Because today is Constitution Day, I figured it would appropriate to share a few reflections on what it is to be an American. Apparently that's a thing these days! But in fact it's been a thing since at least 1781, when J. Hector St. Jean de Crevecoeur published his essay <cite>What Is an American</cite>.</p>
<p>Coincidently, before learning that this is a hot topic, my recent reading had already included a book by John Kouwenhoven entitled <cite>The Beer Can by the Highway: Essays on What's American about America</cite>, first published in 1961. Kouwenhoven's work is mentioned with fair frequency by Albert Murray, whose own insights are quite relevant to the matter at hand.</p>
<p>The results of a recent YouGov poll indicate that people think the most important factors in considering whether someone is an American are obeying U.S. laws, supporting the U.S. Constitution, and believing in the principles of the Declaration of Independence. That's not a bad start because the Declaration and the Constitution are the intellectual heritage of all Americans, but it seems to me (and seemed to Kouwenhoven and Murray) that American identity goes deeper than that.</p>
<p>Murray held that "the basic elements of American behavior" are "improvisation, frontier experience, resilience"; it is this attitude of affirmation in the face of adversity that has brought about "the orchestration of a veritable jam session of dissonant colonial voices into a constitutional democracy" (isn't that a beautiful image?). Similarly, Kouwenhoven wrote that America is not a finished product but an ever-changing process of aliveness: a flexible way of handling experience rather than a fixed and immutable ideal (not even the ideal expressed in the Declaration, which you'll note is all about the <em>pursuit</em> of happiness rather than a particular outcome that applies to everyone). The music of America is, as Whitman put it in one of the central poems of <cite>Leaves of Grass</cite>, the song of the open road.</p>
<p>Indeed, it strikes me that we Americans are not an ethnos - not a <em>people</em> in the sense that the Danes or Egyptians or Koreans or Ukrainians are a people. Aside from the long-suffering American Indians, no American's ancestors were here more than 400 years years ago; and most Americans' ancestors are a mongrel mix of folks from all over the planet. As Murray once put it, Americans are citizens of the world because the world came to America; or as Kouwenhoven once put it, Americans aren't rooted in one place or ethnicity but culturally are perpetually on the move down Walt Whitman's open road, or perhaps Mark Twain's ever-flowing Mississippi River.</p>
<p>Because old man river just keeps rolling along, immigrants the world over are forever welcome to put in and paddle downstream as they add their thoughts, commitments, art, music, foods, deeds, and lifeways to the great stream that is American culture and the American future.</p>
<p>Yes, America has great ideals and foundations, but it's our never-ending process of living up to those ideals and building atop those foundations that makes American identity so distinctive in world history. Or so it seems to me.</p>

<h2><a href="1990.html">Investing in People</a></h2>
<h3>2025-09-07</h3>
<p>In Ayn Rand's novel <cite>The Fountainhead</cite>, the villainous intellectual Ellsworth Toohey shamelessly states his attitude to other people: "I play the stock market of the soul - and I sell short." Because you can't go too far wrong by doing the exact opposite of what a wicked character like Toohey does, I've been thinking about what it means to <em>buy long</em> in human relationships.</p>
<p>In Rand's later writings, she enunciated what she called "The Trader Principle", in which people "exchange value for value" in their relationships. Leaving aside the questionable status of the word 'value' in ethics (see my 2024 post on Hannah Arendt's contrast between value and worth), it seems to me that Rand doesn't go far enough here - for the truly anti-Toohey stance is not merely to trade but to actively <em>invest</em> in other people.</p>
<p>Think, for instance, of Warren Buffett's approach to investing at Berkshire Hathaway: in many cases he hasn't merely purchased stock in other companies, but instead has purchased the entire company! Similarly, venture capital firms pour their own money into early stage companies, which means they are invested in the success of those companies.</p>
<p>In his book <cite>Dependent Rational Animals</cite>, Alasdair MacIntyre describes aspects of what it's like to invest in another person:</p>
<blockquote>Each of us achieves our good only if and insofar as others make our good their good by helping us through periods of disability to become ourselves the kind of human being - through the acquisition and exercise of the virtues - who makes the good of others her or his good, and this not because we have calculated that, only if we help others, will they help us, in some trading of advantage for advantage.</blockquote>
<p>Although MacIntyre's phrasing is rather academic, his point is clear enough, even if I prefer Walter Kaufmann's formulation: through mutual love and care we are "gradually led to more and more profound concern about the loved one's feelings, thoughts, and welfare."</p>
<p>Yet I think we can go beyond even MacIntyre or Kaufmann. Concern is one thing, but the long-term <em>practice</em> of love and friendship (φιλία) gets closer to the heart of things. To capture the essence of this practice, Aristotle used the little Greek word συζῆν: sharing in the activities of living, jointly pursuing fulfillment, making commitments together, taking action together, supporting each other's projects, celebrating each other's successes, supporting each other in times of trouble, feeling with and for each other, thinking things through together, seeking each other’s counsel, treating your shared life as one long conversation and intermingling of souls.</p>

<h2><a href="1989.html">Living Wisdom</a></h2>
<h3>2025-09-05</h3>
<p>While reading yet another book by Pierre Hadot recently, I came across a fascinating passage from the ancient Greek writer Plutarch about philosophy as a way of life. Here's the crux of it, in my own translation:</p>
<blockquote>Socrates indeed was a philosopher, even though he didn't set out benches for students or hold court in a special chair or observe set times for discoursing or walking around with pupils; instead, as chance may have it, he feasted with people, drank with them, served in the army with some of them, hung around in the marketplace with them, and in the end was locked up and drank the poison - yet he was the very first person who showed forth at all times, in all respects, in all experiences, in all activities that plainly and simply living is itself engaging in the love of wisdom.</blockquote>
<p>The ancient Greeks were not the only ones to whom this idea occurred. Over 1500 years after the death of Socrates, the great Zen Buddhist thinker Dōgen formulated his conception of the unity of practice and fulfillment (shushō-ittō): if done with the right awareness and presence, anything we do - chopping wood, carrying water, cooking, cleaning, walking, sitting quietly - can count as a realization of the Way. We don't need to wait years and years to achieve enlightenment, because if we approach living in the right frame of mind then enlightenment is right here, right now, inside us and all around us.</p>
<p><em>Living wisdom is the highest form of loving wisdom.</em></p>

<h2><a href="1988.html">American Complexities</a></h2>
<h3>2025-09-05</h3>
<blockquote>The United States has all of the complexities of all the other nations in the world, and also many of its own...<br>~ Albert Murray, <cite>The Omni-Americans</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>Reading about American history and culture is forever fascinating. Of late I've been focused on learning about various immigrant groups, from monumental ones like the English and the Africans (explained so well by David Hackett Fischer in his books <cite>Albion's Seed</cite> and <cite>African Founders</cite>) to relatively unknown ones like the French Huguenots who migrated to Boston, New York, and South Carolina in the 1690s and the Canary Islanders who settled in southern Louisiana under Spanish rule from 1778 to 1783. America has experienced dozens of such migrant streams, each consisting of atypically adventurous people and each adding its distinctive flavor to the gumbo of American culture. Indeed, as Walt Whitman observed in his 1855 poem <cite>Great Are the Myths</cite>, America is "the nation of clusters of equal nations"; Frederick Douglass echoed Whitman in his 1869 speech <cite>Our Composite Nation</cite>; and Albert Murray renewed these insights in his 1970 book <cite>The Omni-Americans</cite>, wherein he argued that American culture is inherently composite, pluralistic, mulatto.</p>
<p>Not infrequently one hears wistful calls for America to be a more tolerant and kindly place, typically along the lines of a nice Scandinavian country like Denmark. While I'm all in favor of moderation and brotherhood, my impression of Denmark (never having visited!) is that it is free to be so nice because it lacks some of the complexities we have in America. For instance, with only six million people (the same as here in Colorado), most of whose ancestors have lived there for a thousand years or more, Denmark is likely less ethnically composite today than America was even in 1776, let alone in 2025. Once you tack on the vast geography of America, its regional and local diversity, its numerous cities (42 of which are larger than Copenhagen), its many levels of governance (50 states, 3000+ counties, myriad towns and townships, etc.), its ultra-dynamic economy, its countless businesses winking in and out of existence, its outsized role in world affairs, its freewheeling, rebellious, and often troubled history, and so on, you realize that wishing America to be more like Denmark is a pipe dream.</p>
