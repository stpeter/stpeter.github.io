<h2><a href="1777.html">Writing as Thinking</a></h2>
<h3>2023-04-20</h3>
<p>Why write? I suppose there are many reasons: sharing your opinions, persuading others of your positions on issues, journaling through personal challenges, getting things off your chest, creating something beautiful, making a name for yourself, getting published, perhaps even generating income (good luck with that!).</p>
<p>For myself, I find writing to be my best way of thinking. Perhaps it's just me, but I have the kind of butterfly mind that flits from thing to thing and doesn't stay focused on one task or idea for long. If I merely muse about something, my thoughts tend to remain vague and unformed. Only by forcing myself to create a concrete formulation of what's going through my head do I hone the idea sharply enough for it to be useful.</p>
<p>As an example, I always have a backlog of a few dozen topics I'd like to explore in this weblog, but they remain hazy notions until I write them out. It's only then that I clarify my thinking enough to make what I write part of my mental furniture, as it were. Naturally, the furniture might get moved around further as I have new experiences or if I wish to formalize the relevant thoughts, as I might if they will become part of one of the books I plan to write. But step one is always to put things down on paper.</p>

<h2><a href="1776.html">The Pursuit of Happiness</a></h2>
<h3>2023-04-13</h3>
<p>It's been said that America's three greatest contributions to world civilization are jazz, baseball, and the Declaration of Independence. Much as I like the first two, today is a fine day to ponder the third not only because it is Thomas Jefferson's birthday but also because this blog post is entry number 1776 in the online journal I've been keeping since November of 2000.</p>
<p>In line with my philosophical interests, I'd particularly like to delve into the meaning of Jefferson's felicitous phrase "the pursuit of happiness" (about which, no doubt, several books have been written, although I've not read them). Nowadays we think of happiness as a positive feeling or what the psychologists call subjective well-being - essentially, pleasure. Yet Jefferson and the Founders weren't hedonists or utilitarians, for they felt an abiding kinship with classical conceptions of the good life, as found especially in Cicero, the Stoics, and Aristotle.</p>
<p>For these thinkers, phenomena like knowledge and virtue are pursued for their own sake, even if they do not result in further benefits like wealth or pleasure. And because these phenomena are fundamental goals or purposes for human beings, they are key constituents of living well (Greek εὐδαιμονία).</p>
<p>The most sophisticated account of happiness in this deeper sense comes from Aristotle's philosophy of human affairs, which I will explore in my forthcoming book <cite>Complete Yourself</cite>. Aristotle emphasizes repeatedly that eudaimonia is an activity, not a state of mind or a subjective experience. Thus the constituent goals of eudaimonia must be activities, too: what matters is not virtue as an acquired trait, but virtue exercised, especially activity in accordance with virtue; not knowledge obtained, but knowledge exercised, especially activity in accordance with reason; not pleasure as a feeling experienced, but the enjoyed activity itself.</p>
<p>Did the Founders have an action-oriented conception of human flourishing in mind when they enshrined "the pursuit of happiness" into the Declaration? It seems likely to me. Indeed, I'd further propose that coming to a firmer understanding of human flourishing would enable us to better appreciate and extend the principles of freedom we've been bequeathed by our forebears, for America is an ongoing project to which we all must contribute.</p>

<h2><a href="1775.html">Philosophy and Grief</a></h2>
<h3>2023-04-06</h3>
<p>Grieving is one of the characteristic activities of human beings. Although it seems that some other species (e.g., members of the corvid family) experience sorrow, grief is a more complex phenomenon. Recently I had occasion to read a fine book on the topic by Michael Cholbi, entitled <cite>Grief: A Philosophical Guide</cite>. Here are the essentials of what I gleaned.</p>
<p>To begin, we must understand that grief is not an emotion but an activity. Yes, grieving can involve a wide range of emotional reactions: sorrow of course, but also anxiety, guilt, anger, even joy (as Epicurus said: "Sweet is the memory of a dead friend."). But grieving also includes mental states such as confusion and perplexity, as well as mental activities such as deliberation and reflection.</p>
<p>The grounding for this intellectual component is the fact that any significant personal relationship entails a conception of what someone means to you - and that kind of meaning is bound up with your identity, your social role (e.g., within a family), indeed your entire conception of what it means to be human.</p>
<p>Cholbi makes a twofold argument. First, when someone close to you dies (or leaves you or otherwise disappears from your life), the relationship - formed of memories, expectations, longings, commitments, characteristic activities, and so on - is still there, but vastly changed. Second, because of the aforementioned ties to personal identity and practical meaning, coming to understand those changes is a process of gaining greater self-knowledge and thus represents a philosophical achievement.</p>
<p>Perhaps Emily Dickinson summed it up best:</p>
<blockquote>
There is a finished feeling<br>
Experienced at Graves -<br>
A leisure of the Future -<br>
A Wilderness of Size.
<br><br>
By Death's bold Exhibition<br>
Preciser what we are<br>
And the Eternal function<br>
Enabled to infer.
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, it's worth noting that grief was actively discouraged by most of the ancient philosophers, including Socrates, the Stoics, Chuang Tzu, and the Buddha; two notable exceptions were Aristotle and Confucius.</p>

<h2><a href="1774.html">Battle of the Bricks</a></h2>
<h3>2023-03-30</h3>
<p>Last year I decided to read <cite>War and Peace</cite> for the first time. Although Tolstoy's powers of psychological observation are amazing, I got stuck about halfway through (during a lengthy description of a fox hunt), and since then I haven't really been able to get back into it. It didn't help that none of the characters appealed to me strongly, perhaps because so many of them exhibit high levels of pretentiousness or self-deception - or both! Yes, 635 pages is a large investment of time, but getting from there to page 1386 feels like a tough slog and I'm not sure I have the energy.</p>
<p>By contrast, before a recent trip I was looking for a book to read, so I decided to pick up Julie Rose's translation of <cite>Les Misérables</cite>. At 1194 pages this is far from a slim volume, but I have every confidence of finishing it. Granted, I've read Hugo's masterpiece three or four times in another translation, so the story line is familiar. Yet I find myself delighted anew with Hugo's characters and scenes, even with his historical and philosophical digressions (which, I realize, are an acquired taste). The pages are flying by!</p>
<p>It's fascinating that one's patience with and appreciation of a writer can be so personal. I suppose the same goes for friends and other people in one's life. Indeed, Hugo himself makes the connection on page 138: "books are remote but reliable friends." I almost included <cite>Les Misérables</cite> in my recent list of "best friend books"; revisiting this old friend makes me certain that it needs to be on the list.</p>

<h2><a href="1773.html">Intellectual Jousting</a></h2>
<h3>2023-03-17</h3>
<p>In my recent post on intelligence vs. wisdom, I used the phrase "intellectual jousting" to describe the modern practice of doing philosophy. Here's a bit of psychological speculation about how that activity comes to be valued.</p>
<p>Let's say you were the smartest kid in your elementary school class. It feels great to be lauded by the teacher, to ace the tests, and so on. Then you advance to a middle school that's fed by several elementary schools and you're still the smartest kid in the class. Yay! Then you go to a high school that'd fed by several middle schools. It might be less than fully clear who's the smartest now because people start to diverge by subject matter (math whizzes, physics geeks, etc.), but you discover a way to prove your superiority: arguments! After picking up some rhetorical tricks, you can easily best the other kids in your school. Wonderful, you're still the best!</p>
<p>Then you head off to college. If you're especially intelligent (which of course you are), you go to Harvard or Yale or Princeton or Oxford or Cambridge or some such exclusive venue. Now you are surrounded by really smart people - future Nobel Prize winners, Supreme Court justices, and the like. You need to up your argumentative game, at least among those who have self-selected into the most difficult major that doesn't require calculus: philosophy. It's time to learn advanced polemical skills, master formal and informal logic, and hone your argumentative strategies. Once you've done that, you still come out on top.</p>
<p>So it's off to one of the highest-rated Ph.D. programs. Here the competitive atmosphere thickens: you need to prove yourself ever more sharp, clever, quick, brilliant, and resourceful. You become ever more adept at lobbing fatal objections, making cutting remarks, identifying your opponents' logical lapses, and all that. To further prove your intellectual superiority, above all you do these things really fast. Taking time to think things through is for dullards: those with the highest philosophical IQ demonstrate immediate insight. They are, as Colin McGinn puts it, outrageously brilliant. (Do recall the two meanings of "outrageous"!)</p>
<p>Upon completing years of rigorous training and practice in argumentation, you have achieved that exalted status: champion jouster of the intellect. If you're lucky, you'll find a job teaching philosophy to unsuspecting undergraduates for a few years before being denied tenure. If you're extremely lucky, you'll revel in your intellectual superiority for decades while looking down on graduate students and adjunct faculty from your high perch as a tenured professor.</p>
<p>You can have it.</p>

<h2><a href="1772.html">Intelligence vs. Wisdom</a></h2>
<h3>2023-03-17</h3>
<p>Ever since I left behind the high arrogance of my teenage years, I have valued wisdom over intelligence. This is likely why I'm much more drawn to the ancient conception of philosophy as a way of life than to the modern conception of philosophy as an exercise in argumentation.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the criteria that Colin McGinn associates with those who are best at the activity or skill of what's known as doing philosophy: "cleverness, ingenuity, argumentative power, intellectual penetration, insight, polemical punch, sheer philosophical IQ" along with being "so sharp, so intellectually resourceful, so outright brilliant (outrageously so)."</p>
<p>That's all fine for the modern-day sophists who inhabit academia, but I'm not impressed. As I see it, the purpose of philosophical knowledge is not intellectual jousting, but living well. That's why philosophy in its original sense meant the love and practice of wisdom.</p>
<p>Now, I happen to think that exposing yourself to the great philosophical thinkers and traditions helps you to succeed more fully at the task of living a complete human life. Yet one needn't study philosophy in order to attain a fair measure of wisdom: instead, you need to have some experience of life, reflect on that experience, and use the resulting insights to guide your choices and commitments. But perhaps that's too democratic for elitist philosophical experts, eh?</p>
<p>Based on the aforementioned criteria, Colin McGinn has also argued that the greatest philosopher in history is none other than ... Colin McGinn! In the comments section to the post where he makes that claim (perhaps somewhat tongue-in-cheek), he states flat-out that "Philosophy is not a practice (ethical disposition); it's an intellectual subject." If that is so, then perhaps doing philosophy has nothing to do with living a good human life.</p> 
<p>Although these two viewpoints might seem to be worlds apart, I think we might be able to find a middle ground. After all, at least a few of the great philosophers have remained aware of the practical importance of wisdom while pursuing foundational insights in philosophical theory. In that rarified group I'd include the likes of Plato, Aristotle, Chuang Tzu, Spinoza, J.S. Mill, William James, and George Santayana. How did they do it? That's a subject for another post...</p>
