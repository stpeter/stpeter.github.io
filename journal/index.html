<h2><a href="1683.html">Aristotle Research Report #17: Let the Re-Reading Begin</a></h2>
<h3>2021-11-28</h3>
<p>Just under two years ago, I thought I was done with phase one of my research into Aristotle's views o human flourishing, having at that point read around 120 distinct works by or related to Aristotle (including all of Plato's dialogues). Well, I was wrong: since then I've read an additional 150 works, almost exclusively in the scholarly literature on Aristotle. Now I have three whole shelves of books about Aristotle in my office.</p>
<p><img src="/images/aristotle-1a.jpg"></p>
<p>At this point I'm finally ready to begin the process of re-reading - or, to be precise, going over the many passages that I've marked up in these works, organizing the material along topical lines, identifying key themes, and coming to conclusions about the nature and value of Aristotle's insights. But first I think I'll take a break for a few months!</p>

<h2><a href="1682.html">Philosophy vs. Ideology</a></h2>
<h3>2021-11-04</h3>
<p>Today I'd like to explore some implications of my recent series of posts about the nature of opinion; specifically, the dangers of ideology. (As a reminder, so far I've discussed holding fewer opinions, opinions about opinions, holding multiple opinions, opinions vs. truths, and opinions weak and strong.)</p>
<p>Ideology is insidious. When I value strict adherence to an ideology above the pursuit of truth, my internally consistent and strongly held opinions become primary to my identity. In a sense, I'm no longer an independent person but merely a receptable for a belief system. Ideology requires mental conformity and a depth of automatism that goes beyond the mere mouthing of slogans; ultimately, it defines who I am.</p>
<p>We're all familiar with how ideology has been used in service of power within authoritarian and totalitarian societies like Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia. However, relatively liberal societies are by no means immune; present-day America is a fine example, squeezed as it is between Trumpism and wokism. (Indeed, America -- having been founded by crazy Englishmen who sailed across the north Atlantic to settle a howling wilderness in search of God or mammon -- seems especially prone to certain forms of fanaticism.)</p>
<p>And yet, despite the overwhelmingly ideological atmosphere in which we live, I think that one always has the option, no matter how difficult it might be to exercise, of resisting the pressures of ideology and instead living in truth, as the Czech dissident Václav Havel put it.</p>
<p>This concept of living in truth is fascinating. Havel learned it from the Czech philosopher Jan Patočka, who was hounded to death by the secret police for being the spokesperson of the human rights group Charter 77. Patočka in turn thought its sources could be traced as far back as the theology of the Church reformer Jan Hus (1372-1415). To my mind, living in truth is bound up with the love and practice of wisdom -- that is, with philosophy in its original and truest sense. While there is overlap here with the scientific, spiritual, and artistic mindsets, I think philosophy as a way of life is one of the greatest antidotes to ideology.</p>
<p>There is much, much more to explore here, which I plan to do in a series of essays over the next few years.</p>

<h2><a href="1681.html">Meditations on Bach #8: Two Quotes from Pablo Casals</a></h2>
<h3>2021-10-26</h3>
<p>Here are two quotes from the great cellist Pablo Casals, who re-introduced the Bach Cello Suites to the world in the early twentieth century...</p>
<blockquote>For the past eighty years I have started each day in the same manner. It is not a mechanical routine but something essential to my daily life. I go to the piano, and I play two preludes and fugues of Bach. I cannot think of doing otherwise. It is a sort of benediction on the house. But that is not its only meaning for me. It is a rediscovery of the world of which I have the joy of being a part. It fills me with awareness of the wonder of life, with a feeling of the incredible marvel of being a human being. The music is never the same for me, never. Each day it is something new, fantastic and unbelievable. That is Bach, like nature, a miracle! (<cite>Joys and Sorrows</cite>, p. 17)</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>My father used to come once a week from Vendrell to visit me. We would go for walks together, sometimes wandering into music shops looking for music scores; and after a few hours he would have to go back home. The repertoire of the ensemble at the Café Pajarera was broader than the Café Tost; I continued my solos, and of course I needed more music. One day I told my father I needed especially to find some new solo music for the Café Pajarera. Together we set off on the search. For two reasons I shall never forget that afternoon. First, my father bought me my first full-sized cello -- how proud I was to have that wonderful instrument! Then we stopped at an old music shop near the harbor. I began browsing through a bundle of musical scores. Suddenly I came upon a sheaf of pages, crumbled and discolored with age. They were unaccompanied suites by Johann Sebastian Bach -- for the cello only! I looked at them with wonder: <cite>Six Suites for Violoncello Solo</cite>. What magic and mystery, I thought, were hidden in those words? I had never heard of the existence of the suites; nobody -- not even my teachers -- had ever mentioned them to me. I forgot our reason for being at the shop. All I could do was stare at the pages and caress them. That scene has never grown dim. Even today, when I look at the cover of that music, I am back again in the old musty shop with its faint smell of the sea. I hurried home, clutching the suites as if they were crown jewels, and once in my room I pored over them. I read and reread them. I was thirteen at the time, but for the following eighty years the wonder of my discovery has continued to grow on me. Those suites opened up a whole new world. I began playing them with indescribable excitement. They became my most cherished music. I studied and worked at them every day for the next twelve years. Yes, twelve years would elapse and I would be twenty-five before I had the courage to play one of the suites at a public concert. Up until then, no violinist or cellist had ever played one of the Bach suites in its entirety. They would play just a single section -- a Sarabande, a Gavotte or a Minuet. But I played them as a whole: from the Prelude through the five dance movements, with all the repeats that give the wonderful entity and pacing and structure of every movement, the full architecture and artistry. They had been considered academic works, mechanical, without warmth. Imagine that! How could anyone think of them as being cold, when a whole radiance of space and poetry pours forth from them? They are the very essence of Bach, and Bach is the essence of music. (<cite>Joys and Sorrows</cite>, pp. 46-47)</blockquote>

<h2><a href="1680.html">There's No Such Thing as a Kudo</a></h2>
<h3>2021-10-17</h3>
<p>It always warms my heart when we import a word directly from ancient Greek into English. Often they are philosophical locutions, such as eudaimonia and ataraxia. Yet at times more mundane terms make the leap; these days perhaps the most common one is kudos (e.g., "kudos to you on aceing that algebra test!"). Consistent with modern English usage, people tend to pronounce it "koo-doze" and think of it as a plural ("that algebra test was really hard so you deserve many kudos for aceing it"). However, in ancient Greek κῦδος was pronounced "koo-doss" and was a singular noun (meaning fame, honor, renown). Just as we give praise (not "a praise") to a friend or colleague, so an ancient Greek might have given κῦδος. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but as a result <em>there is no such thing as a kudo</em>.</p>

<h2><a href="1679.html">Opinions Weak and Strong</a></h2>
<h3>2021-09-24</h3>
<p>Continuing a thread that I started to explore earlier this year, I'd like to take a closer look at the <em>intensity</em> of opinions. Here as almost everywhere, there is a continuum: we all have opinions we hold strongly and opinions we hold weakly. Not only do the specific contents of these buckets change over time, but in general the intensity of one's opinions can change over time, too. We're all familiar with the sophomoric young adult who has strong opinions about everything (yes, I resembled that remark). Such an individual can be contrasted with the more mature person, who understands what truly matters in life and doesn't hold strong opinions about matters that are less important or positively unimportant.</p>
<p>More pointedly, it can be helpful to ask yourself: do I hold my opinions, or do my opinions hold me? This touches on the sensitive topic of identity: for some people, their opinions aren't just things that they happen think, but a huge part of who they are. This direction can be quite damaging, both for oneself and (if enough people have their identity tied up with their opinions) for society at large.</p>
<p>For such people, it can be progress not if they give up an opinion entirely but if the intensity of their opinion weakens. It seems to me that if your opinions are a big part of your identity then you also tend to engage in binary thinking: you acknowledge only two ways of perceiving the world, one of which (yours, of course!) is right and good in contrast to the other one, which is wrong and bad or even evil.</p>
<p>In my experience there are several antidotes to binary thinking. One of them is recognizing that it's a multi-causal world: there's never just one cause for any reasonably complex phenomenon in human life. If you can identity multiple causes, you're much less likely to believe that your opinion is completely consistent with the one true cause and therefore completely true. The next step is to see that there is some truth in other opinions on the matter at hand - and that there is not only one opposing viewpoint, but several different perspectives.</p>
<p>Adopting this approach to truth and opinion can take many years, in large measure because it requires a great deal of mental flexibility and a willingness to really listen to what other people believe. (For the avoidance of doubt, I'm not saying that the things other people believe are all equally valid; only that if you consider them empathetically you'll likely find aspects that are worthy of respect.)</p>
<p>Next time we'll look at the deeper dangers of binary thinking and how to avoid them.</p>

<h2><a href="1678.html">What I've Learned from Aristotle</a></h2>
<h3>2020-09-12</h3>
<p>My friend Adrian Lory asked me recently to describe the essence of what I've learned from all of my Aristotle readings over the last few years as I prepare to write a book about his views on human flourishing. Here's a brief summary.</p>
<ol>
<li>Happiness or eudaimonia is a matter of living and doing well, of succeeding at a truly human way of life.</li>
<li>Living well is a fulfillment of my nature as a social and thinking being.</li>
<li>Fulfillment is an activity, not a feeling (well being is objective, not subjective).</li>
<li>Character is destiny: the self is not a natural endowment but a personal achievement.</li>
<li>Good activity is grounded in the choices I make.</li>
<li>Choice is a matter of making commitments that result from deliberation about the purpose of life.</li>
<li>The goal of human activity is doing what is beautifully right in any given situation.</li>
<li>It is not enough to commit myself to good activity: I must continually be aware of and actualize my ideals.</li>
<li>True freedom consists of serious leisure devoted to activity for the sake of those I love and inquiry into the sources of human meaning.</li>
<li>The love and practice of wisdom is a way of life.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is all still rather abstract, whereas Adrian is most interested in how my encounter with Aristotle has changed how I live. Here I'd say that I've become more focused on human relationships, more intent on improving my character, more deliberate in forming commitments, more aware of seeing my commitments through in action, and more serious about devoting my leisure time to projects that truly matter to me (especially in the realms of philosophy and music).</p>
