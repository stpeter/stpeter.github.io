<h2><a href="1675.html">Meditations on Bach #6: Five Strings?</a></h2>
<h3>2021-08-14</h3>
<p>Although the first five of Bach's suites for unaccompanied cello lie quite naturally on the bass (when tuned in fifths, that is!), the sixth suite in D major (BWV 1012) is a slightly different story because it was originally written for an instrument with five strings, not four. The exact identity of this instrument remains a mystery - some think it was written for a viola de spalla, others for a violoncello piccolo. Whatever the truth of the matter, playing music written for a five-string instrument on a four-string instrument introduces additional challenges: in particular, it requires intricate playing high up on the fingerboard. Modern cellists try to overcome this challenge through heavy use of thumb position, an innovation that post-dates Bach's lifetime; however, that doesn't make the task much easier. While working on the prelude to the sixth suite, I've realized that playing it on a five-string electric bass would make a lot of sense. Ideally such a bass would be tuned in fifths with a high E string, C-G-D-A-E. This seems achievable by using strings for a six-string bass and discarding one of the strings; for example, La Bella makes a six-string set normally tuned B-E-A-D-G-C and I would tune B up to C, discard the E string, tune A down a step to G, keep D as-is, tune G up a step to A, and tune C up two steps to E. That last adjustment is a bit of a stretch so I'm conferring with Marek Dąbek of Stradi Basses on whether we can transform the "Mocha 4" into a "Mocha 5"...</p>

<h2><a href="1674.html">Doggerel</a></h2>
<h3>2021-08-07</h3>
<p>This piece of light verse popped into my head the other day.</p>
<p>Doggerel</p>
<p>
There is no word that rhymes with dog.<br>
Though some appear as if they should<br>
(The log that's fallen in the wood,<br>
The fog that lingers on the coast),<br>
You'll find that at the very most<br>
Their rhymes are slant and that you can't<br>
Just line them up and hope they sound<br>
As up with pup or sound with hound.<br>
The other creatures have their rhymes,<br>
A name that rings and quickly chimes<br>
(The cat is on the mat, of course,<br>
The horse will run with little force),<br>
But dogs are stuck with no such luck<br>
And strike out when it comes to verse<br>
(Although they seem not much the worse).<br>
No matter how you shake your paws<br>
At strictures of poetic laws,<br>
There is no word that rhymes with dog.

<h2><a href="1673.html">Aristotle Research Report #15: Taking up Aristotle's Causes</a></h2>
<h3>2021-08-01</h3>
<p>In recent times, Aristotle is often criticized for holding back the progress of science for two thousand years. (As Armand Leroi argues in his book <cite>The Lagoon</cite> based on the research of scholars like David Balme, Allan Gotthelf, and James Lennox, this is rather wrongheaded, given that Aristotle founded the science of biology!) One of the ways Aristotle is alleged to have gone astray is in his "doctrine of the four causes" (especially, we're told, the so-called "final cause" which involves impossibilities like backward causation); although I'm always suspicious when someone attributes a "doctrine" to Aristotle, it's worth looking carefully at what Aristotle actually said instead of relying on shallow or antagonistic summaries.</p>
<p>First, even the term "cause" can be misleading, since in modern physical sciences it conjures up images of billiard balls and inclined planes. The Greek word here is αἰτία, which I prefer to translate as "ground": looking at things from the perspective of epistemology, we can ask ourselves about the grounds for explaining why something is the way it is.</p>
<p>Second, the names for the four cases (efficient, material, formal, and final) come from Latin, which always worries me because Latinate terminology often bakes in assumptions from Neo-Platonism and scholastic theology. Let's take them one by one. (I base much of what follows on the fine analysis by Monte Ransome Johnson in his book <cite>Aristotle on Teleology</cite>.)</p>
<p>The efficient cause maps most closely to our modern notion of causation. The term that Aristotle often uses is ὅθεν, literally "whence" or "from which". For Aristotle, this is the active entity that brings a thing into being or that makes a thing change. Typically this active entity is external to the "passive" entity that is made or changed: the parents make a baby, the builder makes a house, etc. However, the active entity can also be internal: the person who deliberates brings about their own actions. For details, see <cite>On Nature</cite> (the "Physics"), Book 2, Chapter 3.</p>
<p>The material cause brings to mind our modern theories of materialism, whether reductive or eliminative. Yet let's look at Aristotle's examples from the same book: a syllable is made up of letters, a living body is made up of liquids and solids, a plant or animal is made of its various organic parts (hand, eye, heart, etc.), and even a conclusion in logic is made up of its premises. Clearly, these grounds are not all material in the modern sense.</p>
<p>The formal cause is in Greek the εἶδος or what I prefer to translate as the "way of being" or identity of a thing. The strange technical phrase Aristotle uses is τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι or "what it has been to be a thing", which in Latin philosophy was translated as "essentia" (whence "essence" in English). One example from Aristotle is the musical octave: what it is to be the octave is to have a ratio of two to one. Similarly, the form of a house is the architectural plan according to which it was built. In biology, the εἶδος is a living being's βίος or way of life.</p>
<p>This brings us to the final cause. Many scholars have written books and articles on this topic, but in brief this is what Aristotle calls τὸ οὗ ἕνεκα or "that for the sake of which". Grammatically this phrase can be used with the dative case in the sense of the aim of something or with the genitive case in the sense of the beneficiary of something. For example, Aristotle says that the eye is for the sake of the activity of seeing (the "aim" or function or adaptive value of the eye is seeing); he also says that the activity of seeing is for the sake of the animal that sees because it is beneficial to have sight (e.g., to find food or avoid prey).</p>
<p>Here is a simple example that summarizes these different grounds for a given phenomenon. Think of a feast or a trip to your favorite restaurant: the thing that moves you to go (the "efficient cause") is hunger; the meal is made up out of food and drink (the "material cause"); the activity of eating and of course talking with other people is part of the human way of life (the "formal cause") since we are social animals who engage in discourse; and that for the sake of which you and your fellow revelers participate (the "final cause") has two aspects: the aim is living well (eudaimonia) and the beneficiaries are the people involved. With regard to the last two of these grounds, we can contrast the human way of eating with that of, say, a herd animal like cattle, who graze in the same field but don't have reason-and-speech (λόγος) and therefore eat together for the sake of living but not for the sake of living well (cf. <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> 1170b11). Here the "formal cause" and "final cause" give different grounds for a similar phenomenon based on the natures of the beings who engage in the activity.</p>
<p>There's much more to say on this topic, of course, but this little outline at least gives a sense of the issues involved.</p>
<p>(By the way, I just finished reading the last book on my list for the research underlying <cite>Complete Yourself: Aristotle on Human Fulfillment</cite>; now I have only a few dozen individual scholarly articles to work through. I'm getting there...)</p>

<h2><a href="1672.html">Meditations on Bach #5: Transcription</a></h2>
<h3>2021-08-01</h3>
<p>As I delve further into Bach's Cello Suites, I also stray further from anything like the received wisdom about how to play them (whether traditionally "classical" or "historically informed"). Take, for instance, the famous prelude from suite #1 in G major. Where I've settled for now is playing the first half at an extremely slow speed, with many sustained single and double notes (thus taking advantage of a capability of the electric bass). As I was practicing this piece at the instrument and then in my head the other day, I realized that I'm playing it at a speed that is appropriate for the breathing characteristic of meditation - half a bar inhaling, half a bar exhaling. That's slow, and perhaps the exact opposite of what Glenn Gould (one of my favorite pianists) did with Bach's keyboard works. However, after the half cadence in measure 22, I start to vary the pace somewhat, speeding up quite a bit in the bariolage of the crescendo before coming back to earth for the ending (which I've modified, too). Reading <cite>History, Imagination, and the Performance of Music</cite> by Peter Walls over the last few days has helped me to realize that, for better or worse, what I'm doing with the Cello Suites is not performance but transcription - more along the lines of, say, Ferruccio Busoni than Pablo Casals. (Indeed, this is not all that dissimilar from what I've done with my "eudaimonia suite" of books on living well: philosophy as the experience of wisdom, not as discursive argument.) I'll make a rough demo of the G major prelude soon to create a record of my current thinking, no matter how wayward it might be.</p>

<h2><a href="1671.html">Blended Vision</a></h2>
<h3>2021-07-05</h3>
<p>The other day I went to see the eye doctor, who told me I have blended vision: one of my eyes is farsighted and the other is nearsighted, but they function well together. Quite a fitting analogy for what Pierre Hadot called philosophy as the love and practice of wisdom. We tend to think of philosophy as hopelessly abstract, but if it is in part a <em>practice</em> then it focuses not only on what is far but also on what is near. One of the poems in my book <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite> tries to capture this insight:</p>
<p>FAR AND NEAR</p>
<p>
The hand of those who legislate<br>
Directs you to what's far away:<br>
Salvation, science, riches, state,<br>
The things that by convention pay.
</p>
<p>
Instead consider what is near<br>
To be your weightiest concern<br>
And focus your attention here:<br>
Apply your powers and discern
</p>
<p>
What benefits you in the way<br>
You interact with foe and friend,<br>
The best division of the day,<br>
Reflection on the time you spend
</p>
<p>
In work and leisure, art and play,<br>
In nature and society,<br>
In what command and what obey,<br>
In courage and propriety.
</p>
<p>
The body has its wisdom, too:<br>
Philosophy applies to sleep,<br>
To what you eat, to what you do<br>
In daily life - this too is deep
</p>
<p>
And subject to a higher code<br>
Of individuality.<br>
By following your natural mode,<br>
You ground your own reality.

<h2><a href="1670.html">Opinions vs. Truths</a></h2>
<h3>2021-06-18</h3>
<p>In recent posts we've looked into holding opinions about fewer topics, holding multiple opinions about the same topic, and changing our opinions about the opinions that other people hold. But what exactly is an opinion? Let's take a closer look.</p>
<p>Pyrrho, a fascinating but shadowy figure reputed to be the founder of ancient Greek skepticism, held that neither opinions nor perceptions are true. Leaving aside perceptions for today, I take this to mean in part that opinions are not the kinds of things that can be true or false in the first place. Taking a cue from the etymological kinship in English between 'true' and 'tree', we can speculate that a truth (not <em>the</em> truth, mind you) is rooted, solid, long-lasting - whereas an opinion is flightly, airy, ephemeral. Although your opinions might change (not that you can necessarily make it happen), a truth isn't something that changes at all: 2+2=4, the inexorable pull of gravity, the inevitability of death.</p>
<p>Naturally there's a continuum; there always is. Yet conceptually the line is bright: vast flocks of noisy opinion-birds flap around inside your head, yet somewhere out there in reality a quiet forest of truth-trees has persisted for thousands of years. Particular truths may fall to the forest floor (say, the geocentric model of the universe), but new trees (say, germ theory) sprout from the resulting humus. These aren't necessarily Thoreau's eternities ("Read not the Times; read the Eternities"), but they're the closest we'll come.</p>
<p>Less poetically, these opinions are notions or sentiments or (at best) provisional judgments you just happen to believe. Often they make you feel better because they're familiar and seem bound up with your very identity, but in my experience holding fewer opinions, along with tempering the ones that remain, frees up mental space for grasping the much smaller number of real truths in human life: the centrality of love and friendship, the precious value of the present moment, the beauty of nature, the follies of boundless materialism and the corruptions of power, the joys of creation and simple awareness, the bedrock importance of personal character, the meaning and perspective granted by the practice of wisdom and reflection, and so on.</p>
<p>So it strikes me that you can choose either to have lots of opinions or to get hold of a few key truths - and I know which path I've chosen.</p>
