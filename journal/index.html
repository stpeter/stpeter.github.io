<h2><a href="1762.html">Circles of Friendship</a></h2>
<h3>2023-01-25</h3>
<p>As noted last week, Robin Dunbar, who has done amazing research into close personal relationships, is best known for "Dunbar's Number" - his finding that the typical friends network contains about 150 people (as discussed in a recent post by Arnold Kling). Yet as I also noted long ago in my blog post "Joining the Band", there are actually multiple Dunbar numbers, each roughly 3x more or less than the next one in the series.</p>
<p>Thus above the 150 mark one finds circles of ~500 acquaintances, ~1500 people whose names you know, and ~5000 people whose faces you recognize. Below the 150 mark one finds circles of ~50 good friends, ~15 best friends (which Dunbar also calls a "support clique"), ~5 close friends (a "sympathy group"), and ~1.5 intimates. (Why 1.5? Men typically have only their spouse in their intimates group, whereas women often have a spouse and a female BFF.)</p>
<p>The smaller the group, the greater the frequency of contact (phone calls, lunches, shared activities, etc.), the greater the emotional closeness and feeling of mutual understanding, and the greater the willingness to help each other.</p>
<p>Why are some people closer to the center of your circles of friendship, and others out toward the periphery? That's where the seven pillars of friendship come in: the more of the pillars you have in common with someone (e.g., similar worldview AND grew up in the same location AND similar sense of humor), the more likely they are to be closer to the center.</p>
<p>Personally I found these insights to shed light on my family relations and friendships, but they have implications for the working world, too. For instance, the makers of GoreTex insist on limiting the size of their factories to 150 people. Startup companies typically go through inflection points as they pass certain milestones (e.g., with more than ~15 people you need more policies and procedures). Teams become ineffective if they have too many people in them (in my experience, much more than 5 is too many). And so on.</p>
<p>Dunbar's 2021 book <cite>Friends</cite> thoroughly summarizes his research, and I highly recommend it if you're curious to learn more.</p>

<h2><a href="1761.html">Metaphysics in Verse II</a></h2>
<h3>2023-01-23</h3>
<p>Among the strangest conceptions of metaphysics is Aristotle's fanciful (or perhaps deadly serious) hypothesis of the Unmoved Mover. It's difficult to understand quite what he was getting at, and I'm not about to formulate a scholarly exegesis of the idea. But I did compose a little poem about it:</p>
<blockquote>
Had I a god, I’m sure it’d be<br>
The sum of all felicity,<br>
Which joys in pure activity -<br>
<br>
Whose every action is a thought,<br>
Whose every insight is what’s sought,<br>
Who ever does just what it ought.<br>
<br>
This god all things would emulate:<br>
Not serve, but strive to re-create<br>
Within the limits of their state.<br>
<br>
What this would mean for humankind<br>
Is not that we would leave behind<br>
What’s animal, but honor mind.

<h2><a href="1760.html">The Seven Pillars of Friendship</a></h2>
<h3>2023-01-19</h3>
<p>Love, friendship, and other close personal relationships have been ill-served in the philosophical literature. Aside from Aristotle's foundational discussion and the occasional essay by the likes of Montaigne, Bacon, and Emerson, few philosophers have contributed deep insights to human relationships. This is disappointing, because as Aristotle observed 2400 years ago we are social creatures for whom close personal relationships are fundamental to our way of life.</p>
<p>We can be thankful, then, that more recently social scientists have stepped into the breach. Previously I highlighted the research of Michael Argyle and Monika Henderson on the rules of friendship, and this time I'd like to draw attention to the excellent work of Robin Dunbar.</p>
<p>Dunbar, who straddles the line between psychology and anthropology, is best known for "Dunbar's Numbar", which I first blogged about in 2004. In the popular understanding, Dunbar's Number is 150: the size of the typical human social network. However, there are actually multiple networks of different sizes, which I'll write about next time.</p>
<p>As a precursor, let's look at another result of the research Dunbar and his associates have done, regarding the reasons why people form close personal relationships in the first place. Dunbar describes these as the seven pillars of friendship, to wit:</p>
<ol>
<li>Having the same language or dialect.</li>
<li>Growing up in the same location.</li>
<li>Having the same educational and career experiences.</li>
<li>Having the same hobbies and interests.</li>
<li>Having the same worldview.</li>
<li>Having the same sense of humor.</li>
<li>Having the same musical tastes.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's natural that these areas of commonality give you things to talk about and also make you more comfortable with another person. From an evolutionary perspective, many of these would have been features of the people in your tribe: you all spoke the same language, grew up in the same location, learned the same lessons and participated in the same activities (whether "work" or "play"), shared the same myths and beliefs, found similar things amusing, even created the same music together. By contrast, those outside your tribe were foreign, strange, and quite possibly threatening.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the 21st century, and life is more complicated: many societies are multi-lingual and multi-ethnic, people move around a lot, educational and career experiences vary widely depending on your path in life, hobbies and interests have multiplied enormously, one can choose from dozens or hundreds of worldviews, and so on. This fragmentation is great for personal expressiveness, but it might make it more difficult for people nowadays to form lasting friendships, stay connected with family members, and the like. Those pillars aren't as strong as they used to be, which is a significant challenge for people today because, as mentioned, we're fundamentally social creatures.</p>

<h2><a href="1759.html">Best Self vs. True Self</a></h2>
<h3>2023-01-12</h3>
<p>As previously mentioned, I am skeptical about the notion of the true self. Recently I've done some reading that has reinforced this skepticism. In particular, research by the likes of Roy Baumeister shows that human beings tend to identify with the activities and desires that they think are best (either individually or socially) and to disown the activities and desires that they think aren't so admirable.</p>
<p>For instance, let's say you have a guilty little secret: you spend an inordinate amount of time binge-watching re-runs of Charlie's Angels. You might think to yourself "that's not the true me" because you wish that you would spend your time differently or because you'd be embarrassed if friends and family found out about your 70s TV habit. However, if it's true of you, then, like it or not, it's expressive of your true self.</p>
<p>By contrast, I might grant the existence of the best self. For instance, counselors and coaches sometimes recommend an exercise in which you describe your best possible self: an aspirational vision of yourself at your most admirable, which you can use to motivate improvements in your life. Your best self is more like your future self than your true self: a person of whom you have had glimpses throughout your life, but whom you must strive to become more consistently.</p>
<p>Hard-headed realists might assert that the best self doesn't actually exist, because it's a mere potential. Yet as a good Aristotelian I am not deterred, but instead inspired to transform the potential into the actual.</p>

<h2><a href="1758.html">Metaphysics in Verse</a></h2>
<h3>2023-01-12</h3>
<p>One of the things I do to avoid exposure to the news is immerse myself in poetry. Most recently I've been reading English and American poets from the 1500s and 1600s, such as Anne Bradstreet, Samuel Daniel, and Thomas Traherne. At the same time, I've started an intensive re-reading of Aristotelian texts and commentary in preparation for writing an epitome of Aristotle's views on human flourishing. Putting the two together can yield some intriguing combinations!</p>
<p>For instance, I've been pondering the very beginning of Aristotle's <cite>Metaphysics</cite>, which in the classic translation by W.D. Ross is rendered as follows:</p>
<blockquote>All men by nature desire to know. An indication of this is the delight we take in our senses; for even apart from their usefulness they are loved for themselves; and above all others the sense of sight. For not only with a view to action, but even when we are not going to do anything, we prefer seeing (one might say) to everything else. The reason is that this, most of all the senses, makes us know and brings to light many differences between things.</blockquote>
<p>To make it more memorable, I decided to cast it into old-style verse, and here's what came out:</p>
<blockquote>
All human beings yearn to know;<br>
'Tis nature that doth make it so:<br>
Our mind and soul are such that hence<br>
We joy in each and various sense.<br>
But most of all we truly prize<br>
The evidence that, through our eyes,<br>
Doth never cease us to amaze<br>
And ever draws our loving gaze.
</blockquote>
<p>Although I'm no Lucretius, these lines were fun to play with.</p>

<h2><a href="1757.html">Growing into One's Nature</a></h2>
<h3>2023-01-05</h3>
<p>Existentialist philosophers insist on the ability - indeed, the responsibility - for human beings to create themselves. This is the import of Sartre's famous formulation "existence precedes essence": there is no human essence, and if you believe so then you are engaging in "bad faith" and living inauthentically.</p>
<p>Given all that we have discovered so far about human biology, psychology, and ethology over the last 75 years, these existentialist notions seem rather quaint. Yet even humanistic psychologists who in those days were significantly influenced by the existentialists recognized that Sartre and his ilk had gone too far. Consider this passage from an unpublished manuscript by Abraham Maslow (quoted on page 374 of Scott Barry Kaufman's recent book <cite>Transcend: The New Science of Self-Actualization</cite>):</p>
<blockquote>Aristotle, Spinoza, Aquinas and others have stressed as a basic law of all being that everything has a tendency and a right to persist in its own nature. The human species has [as] a "species-specific character" the peculiarity that "persisting in its own nature" is a long slow process of <em>growing</em> into one's own nature. It takes a lifetime to become fully-human, i.e., it takes a lifetime for a baby to persist and [become] its own nature ... essence is potential and therefore has to be actualized, made.</blockquote>
<p>Yes, there is much that we can create about our lives, but there are limits. As Aristotle would say, we are social beings, linguistic beings, thinking beings, enculturated beings. Two quotes from Aristotle's <cite>Politics</cite> are illustrative. First: "He who is unable to live in society, or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast or a god." (1253a27–29) Second: "What each thing is when fully developed we call its nature." (1252b32-33) Plus, of course, all of our concepts related to "actualization" of "potentials" - or, as I prefer to phrase it, "activation" of "capacities" - comes straight out of Aristotle's metaphysics and biology. This will be a major theme of my forthcoming book <cite>Complete Thyself: Aristotle on Human Fulfillment</cite>.</p>
