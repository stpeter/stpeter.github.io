<h2><a href="1813.html">Washington's Wisdom</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-19</h3>
<p>Recently I carved out time to read Ron Chernow's 800-page biography of George Washington. We tend to have only vague notions about Washington, but Chernow's biography truly brings him to life. Far from being the wooden, mythical figure we imagine, Washington was a man of great passions and strong emotions, which he worked hard to direct into productive channels throughout his long career in private life and public service.</p>
<p>Washington's strengths were legion. A French military officer observed, perhaps with slight exaggeration, that Washington was "brave without temerity, laborious without ambition, generous without prodigality, noble without pride, virtuous without severity." I'm especially fascinated by Washington's decision making, and how he improved in that regard over time. Apparently he excelled at learning from his mistakes; not only did he welcome honest criticism from others, but he was ruthlessly self-critical as well. First as commander in chief of the Continental Army and then as the founding president of the United States of America, he actively sought out competing opinions from the men on his staff. Yet he wasn't in a hurry to figure out the practical truth: as Chernow says, "Washington's inestimable strength, whether as a general, a planter, or a politician, was prolonged deliberation and slow, mature decisions."</p>
<p>Furthermore, Washington held himself to extremely high standards of personal and professional integrity. Whereas a lesser leader could easily have turned dictatorial in such a revolutionary environment, Washington hewed to a stricter path and always deferred to civilian authority as commander in chief and to constitutional principles as president. As Kipling might have said, he kept his head when all about him were losing theirs and blaming it on him: he did not allow himself to be overly impressed with his great successes, nor to seek revenge against critics and rivals who attacked him so incessantly. And yes, as a Virginia planter Washington did own slaves (as did his wife Martha through her first marriage), but he was the only slaveholding Founder who freed his slaves, albeit at the end of his life after long reflection on both the moral evils of slavery and the practicalities of emancipation (such as keeping families together and training his slaves in the skills they would need for a free life).</p>
<p>In sum, I conclude that, although Washington wasn't perfect, overall he was close to an exemplar of the virtue that Aristotle called phronesis or practical wisdom. The contrast with present-day demagogues is as glaring as it is distressing.</p>

<h2><a href="1812.html">Political Animals</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-18</h3>
<p>One of Aristotle's most famous observations is that human beings are "political animals"; yet the meaning of this phrase is not widely understood or appreciated. Let's take a closer look.</p>
<p>Scholars such as R.G. Mulgan and David J. Depew have identified three core senses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Humans have a capacity for self-governance.</li>
<li>Humans often engage in a "citified" way of life.</li>
<li>Humans work cooperatively toward communal goals.</li>
</ol>
<p>According to Aristotle, humans share the third, "zoological" sense with social insects like ants and bees. In all of these species, there is differentiation of activity toward a single end, which is the survival or flourishing of the community. For instance, as entomologist Thomas Seeley has described in a remarkable series of books including <cite>The Life of Bees</cite> and <cite>Honeybee Democracy</cite>, honeybees perform disparate tasks to maintain the nest (somewhat segregated by queen, male drones, and female worker bees), and even engage in a form of democratic decision-making to choose new nesting locations!</p>
<p>Aristotle distinguishes the "political" animals from the "gregarious" or herding animals like cattle and deer. As Depew puts it in his paper <cite>Humans and Other Political Animals in Aristotle's History of Animals</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>Only political animals, among the wider array of gregarious animals, cooperate to achieve "something one and common that is the work of all" (<cite>Historia Animalium</cite> I.1.488a9).... [M]erely gregarious animals separately perform the <em>same</em> activities in physical proximity to others of their kind ... by contrast, political animals perform <em>different</em> activities in the course of engaging in and contributing to a single way of life."</blockquote>
<p>An immediate illustration of this difference is the significance of shared meals in human existence. For instance, as I watch the deer that live near my house, I observe that they all chomp separately on the grasses, but don't otherwise interact much. Compare that to, say, a meal at your favorite restaurant: the employees perform multiple roles, numerous trades built the structure where you sit, and there's a vast supply chain for the food and beverages - all of which is ultimately for the sake of a convivial experience in which the repast itself is merely an excuse for conversation and the enjoyment of your relationship with your tablemates. This example (encompassing language, farming, cooking, economics, customs, forethought, friendship, and much else besides) is the merest indication of how deep sociality runs in human life.</p>

<h2><a href="1811.html">Self-Government</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-17</h3>
<p>As noted the other day in my post on the death of democracy, Thomas Jefferson held that the townships of New England were "the wisest invention ever devised by the wit of man for the perfect exercise of self-government." If indeed they are an ideal, it would benefit us to understand what they are and how they work. Toward that end, I'll introduce a somewhat extraordinary example: Monhegan Island, Maine.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that I grew up in Maine, I've never visited Monhegan. However, I've been intrigued by it every time I've flown over it on my way to Rockland, and I've read quite a bit about this fascinating place. The island is about a square mile in size and lies 12 nautical miles out to sea, accessible only by boat. A mere seventy or so people live there year round, though the population swells appreciably in the summer. Much of the island is owned by a non-profit foundation, started by Thomas Edison's son Theodore, that keeps the land in a wild state. The populated portion is dotted with cottages, seasonal lodgings and businesses, a library, a lighthouse, and an art museum (the island has been especially favored by painters, including Rockwell Kent, Edward Hopper, and the Wyeth family). There are no streetlights, no paved roads, no cars (a few fishermen have pickup trucks for work purposes), no airplane flights, no sirens, no policemen, no bureaucrats, etc. It's practically a 19th-century experience.</p>
<p>Because the island is so isolated, the folks who live there need to supply, on their own behalf, many of the services that mainlanders take for granted. In fact, the place isn't even a town, but a special form of government that exists only in Maine, called a plantation. Originally used for areas that were growing into townships, a plantation can't pass its own ordinances and thus needs to operate in an even more collaborative fashion than a town. As a result, Monhegan seems to function through a set of voluntary initiatives and interlocking associations that provide electric power, fresh water, dock maintenance, telephone service (they're working on broadband Internet), affordable housing, island-grown foods, and so on.</p>
<p>In short, as an article in the <cite>Island Journal</cite> put it some years ago, Monhegan is "one of the great anomalies of early-21st-century American life: an ancient, self-governing village, essentially classless and car-less, whose homes, sheds, and footpaths appear to have thrust themselves out of the wild and arrestingly beautiful landscape."</p>
<p>Granted, few people want to live in a place like Monhegan Island. Yet it's comforting to know that somewhere in America we still have an existence proof of radical self-government.</p>

<h2><a href="1810.html">Act Locally</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-16</h3>
<p>Because my last post about the supposed death of democracy was rather theoretical, I figured I'd follow it up with something more practical.</p>
<p>Few of us actually live - or even <em>want</em> to live - in the kind of small town that enacts true self-government. Does that mean we're consigned to political impotence?</p>
<p>Not necessarily. There are always opportunities for local involvement if one is interested in seeking them out. As I mentioned in the comment thread at my last post, here are some of the activities I've taken on over the years:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managing the website for our neighborhood (both for the civic association where I live now in Douglas County, Colorado, and formerly for our neighborhood in Denver).</li>
<li>Keeping an eye on government activities in our county and in the nearest town (Parker, Colorado) to gauge their impact on our neighborhood. At times this leads me to attend and speak out at public meetings.</li>
<li>Clearing neighborhood walking trails.</li>
<li>Volunteering at a local food bank.</li>
<li>Teaching English as a Second Language to immigrants through a program run by our county library.</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally, the activities that appeal to you or that align with your skills might be quite different, but they're out there.</p>
<p>Some might ask: why bother? I see several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>As the late positive psychologist Chris Peterson never tired of saying, "Other people matter." According to the Pew Research Center, only 26% of Americans know most of their neighbors, and 23% of people under 30 don't know <em>any</em> of their neighbors. That's sad.</li>
<li>Personally, I enjoy helping people, being connected, and fostering stronger ties with the folks around me. If you think that's not worth your time, I respectfully suggest that you reconsider.</li>
<li>More prudentially, if there's ever serious trouble in your neighborhood (where I live that might be a wildfire), you'll be happy that you know your neighbors and understand how to work with them. An emergency is not the time to figure this out!</li>
</ol>
<p>I can't claim that I've always been so civic-minded. Indeed, earlier in life I was far more ideological and also quite self-absorbed (those two might go hand in hand). Somewhere along the line I realized that it's better to be involved than to be isolated. Many people seem to think that online "connections" are enough, but in my experience real life is much more fulfilling...</p>

<h2><a href="1809.html">The Death of Democracy?</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-13</h3>
<p>Is democracy in peril? Apparently many pundits think so. Yet 'democracy' is notoriously difficult to define. Although I strive to stay away from political topics in this journal, perhaps by applying some philosophical elbow grease we can lessen our worries about yet another emergency disaster crisis.</p>
<p>The ancient Greeks understood δημοκρατία to mean that power was held and exercised by the people. The Athenian democracy, which is the ancient one we know best, included all sorts of clever hacks to ensure that the people (well, propertied male citizens) would be involved in ruling; these included a massive assembly and random selection of citizens to higher office. The Athenians distinguished these democratic principles from oligarchy (rule by the few - typically the rich) and monarchy (rule by one person - either a hereditary king or a non-hereditary "tyrant").</p>
<p>The Athenians would not agree with us that elections are the hallmark of democracy. Indeed, they suspected that choosing government officers through elections instead of random selection would lead to an oligarchy because only the rich would end up serving. We have living proof of their fears today, since with a few exceptions our current system of government is oligarchic, not democratic.</p>
<p>Aside from jury service, one of those exceptions is small-town government, especially in New England. As I mentioned over twenty years ago in this journal, no less a political philosopher than Thomas Jefferson held that we should "divide the counties into wards" (i.e., townships) so that the people could govern themselves. In his letter to Samuel Kerchival of July 12, 1816, Jefferson called for "making every citizen an acting member of the government" through the following means:</p>
<blockquote>Divide the counties into wards of such size as that every citizen can attend when called on, and act in person. Ascribe to them the government of their wards in all things relating to themselves exclusively.... These wards, called townships in New England, are the vital principle of their governments, and have proved themselves the wisest invention ever devised by the wit of man for the perfect exercise of self-government, and for its preservation.</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, even in New England the tradition of the town meeting has atrophied somewhat, as Frank Bryan describes in his book <cite>Real Democracy</cite>. Part of the challenge can be attributed to our old friend, Dunbar's numbers. Robin Dunbar has shown that most people are truly acquainted with only 500 people, know only 1,500 people by name, and know only 5,000 people by sight. The town I grew up in (Readfield, Maine) had about 2,000 people when I lived there, and the town meeting seemed to function fairly well if I recall correctly. But if a town grows to 5,000 or 10,000 people, it's unlikely that self-governance can be sustained. To handle population growth (America had 4 million people in 1790 but has 330+ million today), perhaps Jefferson would have said "divide the towns into neighborhoods!"</p>
<p>In any case, it strikes me that if democracy in America is dying, it has been a slow, steady process as the population has grown, as power has been increasingly centralized in the managerial state at the national level, as fewer people have direct experience of self-government in their own town or neighborhood, and so on. Paradoxically, perhaps, I am less concerned about a sudden collapse of representative "democracy" and more concerned about the seemingly inexorable decline of self-government.</p>

<h2><a href="1808.html">Daily Reflection</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-09</h3>
<p>As a counterpart to my morning practice of daily forethought, I've also been engaging in daily reflection every evening. This habit was made famous by the ancient Stoic Seneca in Book III of his dialogue <cite>On Anger</cite>, where he mentions that his teacher Sextius asked himself these three probing questions before going to sleep: "What bad habit of yours have you cured today? What vice have you checked? In what respect are you better?" Some of my questions are more positive, but still geared toward living a more examined life:</p>
<ul>
<li>What went well today? Why? What should I keep doing?</li>
<li>What didn't go well today? Why not? What should I stop doing?</li>
<li>Were there situations today in which I didn't act in accordance with my best self? How will I do better next time?</li>
<li>What progress did I make today regarding my relationships, projects, character, health, knowledge, and wisdom?</li>
<li>Did I have any positive experiences today that are worth savoring?</li>
</ul>
<p>The key themes I try to bring out are awareness of how I'm conducting myself and interacting with other people, objectivity about my strengths and weaknesses, honest understanding and analysis of my behavior, reinforcement of what I'm doing right, correction of what I'm doing wrong, and commitment to my chosen principles and policies in life.</p>
<p>And as I begin the day with a kind of benediction, so I've been experimenting with something similar at the end of the day: "Thankful am I for having enjoyed another day on this beautiful earth. May it be said that I made the most of it. I have lived, and lived well."</p>
<p>This last sentence is a paraphrase of a suggestion that Seneca makes in his twelfth letter to Lucilius: "Let us go to our sleep with joy and gladness; let us say: I have lived." Yet I affix an Aristotelian coda, which is that more important than living is <em>living well</em>.</p>
