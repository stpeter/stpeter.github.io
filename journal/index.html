<h2><a href="1811.html">Self-Government</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-17</h3>
<p>As noted the other day in my post on the death of democracy, Thomas Jefferson held that the townships of New England were "the wisest invention ever devised by the wit of man for the perfect exercise of self-government." If indeed they are an ideal, it would benefit us to understand what they are and how they work. Toward that end, I'll introduce a somewhat extraordinary example: Monhegan Island, Maine.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that I grew up in Maine, I've never visited Monhegan. However, I've been intrigued by it every time I've flown over it on my way to Rockland, and I've read quite a bit about this fascinating place. The island is about a square mile in size and lies 12 nautical miles out to sea, accessible only by boat. A mere seventy or so people live there year round, though the population swells appreciably in the summer. Much of the island is owned by a non-profit foundation, started by Thomas Edison's son Theodore, that keeps the land in a wild state. The populated portion is dotted with cottages, seasonal lodgings and businesses, a library, a lighthouse, and an art museum (the island has been especially favored by painters, including Rockwell Kent, Edward Hopper, and the Wyeth family). There are no streetlights, no paved roads, no cars (a few fishermen have pickup trucks for work purposes), no airplane flights, no sirens, no policemen, no bureaucrats, etc. It's practically a 19th-century experience.</p>
<p>Because the island is so isolated, the folks who live there need to supply, on their own behalf, many of the services that mainlanders take for granted. In fact, the place isn't even a town, but a special form of government that exists only in Maine, called a plantation. Originally used for areas that were growing into townships, a plantation can't pass its own ordinances and thus needs to operate in an even more collaborative fashion than a town. As a result, Monhegan seems to function through a set of voluntary initiatives and interlocking associations that provide electric power, fresh water, dock maintenance, telephone service (they're working on broadband Internet), affordable housing, island-grown foods, and so on.</p>
<p>In short, as an article in the <cite>Island Journal</cite> put it some years ago, Monhegan is "one of the great anomalies of early-21st-century American life: an ancient, self-governing village, essentially classless and car-less, whose homes, sheds, and footpaths appear to have thrust themselves out of the wild and arrestingly beautiful landscape."</p>
<p>Granted, few people want to live in a place like Monhegan Island. Yet it's comforting to know that somewhere in America we still have an existence proof of radical self-government.</p>

<h2><a href="1810.html">Act Locally</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-16</h3>
<p>Because my last post about the supposed death of democracy was rather theoretical, I figured I'd follow it up with something more practical.</p>
<p>Few of us actually live - or even <em>want</em> to live - in the kind of small town that enacts true self-government. Does that mean we're consigned to political impotence?</p>
<p>Not necessarily. There are always opportunities for local involvement if one is interested in seeking them out. As I mentioned in the comment thread at my last post, here are some of the activities I've taken on over the years:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managing the website for our neighborhood (both for the civic association where I live now in Douglas County, Colorado, and formerly for our neighborhood in Denver).</li>
<li>Keeping an eye on government activities in our county and in the nearest town (Parker, Colorado) to gauge their impact on our neighborhood. At times this leads me to attend and speak out at public meetings.</li>
<li>Clearing neighborhood walking trails.</li>
<li>Volunteering at a local food bank.</li>
<li>Teaching English as a Second Language to immigrants through a program run by our county library.</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally, the activities that appeal to you or that align with your skills might be quite different, but they're out there.</p>
<p>Some might ask: why bother? I see several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>As the late positive psychologist Chris Peterson never tired of saying, "Other people matter." According to the Pew Research Center, only 26% of Americans know most of their neighbors, and 23% of people under 30 don't know <em>any</em> of their neighbors. That's sad.</li>
<li>Personally, I enjoy helping people, being connected, and fostering stronger ties with the folks around me. If you think that's not worth your time, I respectfully suggest that you reconsider.</li>
<li>More prudentially, if there's ever serious trouble in your neighborhood (where I live that might be a wildfire), you'll be happy that you know your neighbors and understand how to work with them. An emergency is not the time to figure this out!</li>
</ol>
<p>I can't claim that I've always been so civic-minded. Indeed, earlier in life I was far more ideological and also quite self-absorbed (those two might go hand in hand). Somewhere along the line I realized that it's better to be involved than to be isolated. Many people seem to think that online "connections" are enough, but in my experience real life is much more fulfilling...</p>

<h2><a href="1809.html">The Death of Democracy?</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-13</h3>
<p>Is democracy in peril? Apparently many pundits think so. Yet 'democracy' is notoriously difficult to define. Although I strive to stay away from political topics in this journal, perhaps by applying some philosophical elbow grease we can lessen our worries about yet another emergency disaster crisis.</p>
<p>The ancient Greeks understood δημοκρατία to mean that power was held and exercised by the people. The Athenian democracy, which is the ancient one we know best, included all sorts of clever hacks to ensure that the people (well, propertied male citizens) would be involved in ruling; these included a massive assembly and random selection of citizens to higher office. The Athenians distinguished these democratic principles from oligarchy (rule by the few - typically the rich) and monarchy (rule by one person - either a hereditary king or a non-hereditary "tyrant").</p>
<p>The Athenians would not agree with us that elections are the hallmark of democracy. Indeed, they suspected that choosing government officers through elections instead of random selection would lead to an oligarchy because only the rich would end up serving. We have living proof of their fears today, since with a few exceptions our current system of government is oligarchic, not democratic.</p>
<p>Aside from jury service, one of those exceptions is small-town government, especially in New England. As I mentioned over twenty years ago in this journal, no less a political philosopher than Thomas Jefferson held that we should "divide the counties into wards" (i.e., townships) so that the people could govern themselves. In his letter to Samuel Kerchival of July 12, 1816, Jefferson called for "making every citizen an acting member of the government" through the following means:</p>
<blockquote>Divide the counties into wards of such size as that every citizen can attend when called on, and act in person. Ascribe to them the government of their wards in all things relating to themselves exclusively.... These wards, called townships in New England, are the vital principle of their governments, and have proved themselves the wisest invention ever devised by the wit of man for the perfect exercise of self-government, and for its preservation.</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, even in New England the tradition of the town meeting has atrophied somewhat, as Frank Bryan describes in his book <cite>Real Democracy</cite>. Part of the challenge can be attributed to our old friend, Dunbar's numbers. Robin Dunbar has shown that most people are truly acquainted with only 500 people, know only 1,500 people by name, and know only 5,000 people by sight. The town I grew up in (Readfield, Maine) had about 2,000 people when I lived there, and the town meeting seemed to function fairly well if I recall correctly. But if a town grows to 5,000 or 10,000 people, it's unlikely that self-governance can be sustained. To handle population growth (America had 4 million people in 1790 but has 330+ million today), perhaps Jefferson would have said "divide the towns into neighborhoods!"</p>
<p>In any case, it strikes me that if democracy in America is dying, it has been a slow, steady process as the population has grown, as power has been increasingly centralized in the managerial state at the national level, as fewer people have direct experience of self-government in their own town or neighborhood, and so on. Paradoxically, perhaps, I am less concerned about a sudden collapse of representative "democracy" and more concerned about the seemingly inexorable decline of self-government.</p>

<h2><a href="1808.html">Daily Reflection</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-09</h3>
<p>As a counterpart to my morning practice of daily forethought, I've also been engaging in daily reflection every evening. This habit was made famous by the ancient Stoic Seneca in Book III of his dialogue <cite>On Anger</cite>, where he mentions that his teacher Sextius asked himself these three probing questions before going to sleep: "What bad habit of yours have you cured today? What vice have you checked? In what respect are you better?" Some of my questions are more positive, but still geared toward living a more examined life:</p>
<ul>
<li>What went well today? Why? What should I keep doing?</li>
<li>What didn't go well today? Why not? What should I stop doing?</li>
<li>Were there situations today in which I didn't act in accordance with my best self? How will I do better next time?</li>
<li>What progress did I make today regarding my relationships, projects, character, health, knowledge, and wisdom?</li>
<li>Did I have any positive experiences today that are worth savoring?</li>
</ul>
<p>The key themes I try to bring out are awareness of how I'm conducting myself and interacting with other people, objectivity about my strengths and weaknesses, honest understanding and analysis of my behavior, reinforcement of what I'm doing right, correction of what I'm doing wrong, and commitment to my chosen principles and policies in life.</p>
<p>And as I begin the day with a kind of benediction, so I've been experimenting with something similar at the end of the day: "Thankful am I for having enjoyed another day on this beautiful earth. May it be said that I made the most of it. I have lived, and lived well."</p>
<p>This last sentence is a paraphrase of a suggestion that Seneca makes in his twelfth letter to Lucilius: "Let us go to our sleep with joy and gladness; let us say: I have lived." Yet I affix an Aristotelian coda, which is that more important than living is <em>living well</em>.</p>

<h2><a href="1807.html">Daily Forethought</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-07</h3>
<p>In pursuit of a more examined life, I've been honing my daily habits. Taking a hint from the ancient Stoics, first thing in the morning I've been thinking about the day ahead and then at the end of the day I've been reflecting on how the day went. Here's a snapshot of what this looks like for me (I'll split this up into two posts, one prospective and one retrospective).</p>
<p>To begin the day, I apply an Epicurean twist and take a moment to appreciate the simple fact of being alive to enjoy another day of existence. This includes being grateful for some of the many beautiful and beneficial aspects of the life I lead. Then I ask myself a series of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are my most important activities today? How will I make them positive, productive and meaningful?</li>
<li>Which relationships will I nurture today?</li>
<li>Which long-term projects will I move forward today?</li>
<li>Which practices will I focus on today to strengthen my character?</li>
<li>What will I do today for the sake of my health?</li>
<li>What will I do today to appreciate the beauty of the world around me?</li>
<li>What opportunities for learning will I have today?</li>
<li>What setbacks might I face today and how will I prepare for them?</li>
<li>What positive experiences will I create today for myself and the people I care about?</li>
</ul>
<p>To make this session as successful as possible, I try to keep the following themes in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Raising my <em>awareness</em> throughout the day.</li>
<li>Approaching the day with a greater sense of <em>purpose</em>.</li>
<li>Having more <em>optimism</em> about what I can accomplish.</li>
<li>Facing challenges with greater <em>resilience</em>.</li>
<li>Maintaining a high level of <em>focus</em>.</li>
<li>Putting a premium on effective <em>action</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I keep a notes document on my phone to remind me of these questions and themes, which I look at before I peek at ephemera like email, news headlines, or the weather forecast. As Thoreau said, "Read not the Times; Read the Eternities." And what's more eternal than living a good life?</p>

<h2><a href="1806.html">Tao Te Ching §11: Emptiness</a></h2>
<h3>2023-08-03</h3>
<p>Following up on yesterday's post about the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite>, here's another poem that I might set to music (chapter 11 in the standard order). My provisional rendering is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
Some thirty spokes meet in one hub<br>
Through emptiness it does its work<br>
Throw clay and shape it to a jar<br>
Through emptiness it does its work<br>
Cut doors and windows, make a room<br>
Through emptiness it does its work
<br><br>
The craftsman profits from its mass<br>
And yet it works through emptiness
</blockquote>
<p>At only 8 lines, it would make for an extremely short song. But that might be the nature of this project!</p>
<p>In this poem we glimpse the paradoxical side of Taoism. To my mind it suggests an aesthetic appreciation for subtlety, silence, simplicity, austere beauty, and what must be left unsaid - the space between the notes, if you will. Indeed, this poem raises the possibility that the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite> itself might do its work through emptiness, for if the philosophical is the personal then (as chapter 1 puts it) "the way that we can say is not the ageless Way" and "the name that we can name is not the ageless Name".</p>
<p>But how could this be? Isn't the ageless something abstract and far away? Perhaps; but perhaps instead it's something tangible and near: the abiding ways of living that human beings have engaged in for as long as we have been on this beautiful earth of ours.</p>
