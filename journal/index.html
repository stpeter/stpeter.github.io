<h2><a href="1929.html">Value vs. Worth</a></h2>
<h3>2024-12-10</h3>
<p>In her book <cite>The Human Condition</cite>, Hannah Arendt argues that there is a subtle yet essential difference between value and worth: the concept of value is irreducibly social because it first emerged only within modern market economies where everything can be exchanged for everything else, whereas the worth of a person or artifact or living being is inherent within its own independent existence. Thus, according to Arendt, philosophers made a grave mistake when they imported the concept of value into politics, ethics, and aesthetics (the so-called "value branches" of philosophical inquiry). Consider, for instance, what happens when we speak of the relative value of the life of inquiry and contemplation vs. the life of social and political engagement vs. the life of making money vs. the life of pleasure and enjoyment. In modern times these wildly disparate ways of life are all on an equal footing of "value", which means we need to find a common standard of measurement for them. Just as in the market everything can and must be valued in terms of money, so now in ethics everything can and must be valued in terms of what the psychologists call subjective well-being, i.e., pleasurable feelings. As a result, the concept of value leads inexorably to a lowest-common-denominator utilitarianism. By contrast, the concept of worth helps us keep separate things that should be kept separate; as a result, we can come to understand that these ways of life are far from commensurable and that some of them are fundamentally better than others. Yet deliberating about worth takes more intellectual effort and moral courage (not to mention the fact that it can seem positively undemocratic), which could be why many people prefer to avoid it...</p>

<h2><a href="1928.html">My Intellectual History, Part IV</a></h2>
<h3>2024-12-06</h3>
<p>It's been exactly ten years since the last installment of my "intellectual history", so I figure it's time to say something about changes in my thinking since then.</p>
<p>One trend has been my deepening dedication to philosophy as a way of life, and not to any particular philosophical school. Although I began reading Pierre Hadot's books on philosophy as a way of life around 2011, writing my books on Thoreau (2017) and Nietzsche (2019) definitely reinforced this outlook. Indeed, at root this has always been my approach to the love of wisdom: I've never been enamored of purely theoretical, abstract, or academic philosophy, which is why I decided all those years ago not to pursue a Ph.D. in the subject.</p>
<p>A second trend has been my re-immersion in ancient Greek thought and culture. The Greeks have never been far from my mind, but intensively researching Aristotle's ethics for the last five years has rekindled my appreciation for what they achieved. In addition to all my Aristotle (and Plato) readings, this year I revisited both the Iliad and the Odyssey (twice!) and also started composing an epic poem about Pyrrho and Alexander the Great; next year I'll likely re-read Hesiod, the Greek lyric poets, and all of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides to round out my literary explorations.</p>
<p>Third has been a continued mellowing and moderating of my political perspective. Gone are my days as a fire-breathing libertarian. Although I still favor an evolution toward greater freedom, I have enough intellectual humility at this point to see that societal problems are incredibly complex (as one example, it seems to me that legalization of marijuana, long a hobbyhorse of libertarians, has been far from an unalloyed good). Moreover, I have come to realize that I am powerless to change the political climate; some might find such a realization distressing, but I've found it liberating.</p> 
<p>Fourth, over the last two years I've been reading more fiction, supplementing my longtime and continuing practice of reading poetry. During my working years, my exposure to novels, plays, and epics had slowed to a trickle, but of late I've quite enjoyed reading Homer, Virgil, Victor Hugo, George Eliot, and of course the plays of Shakespeare (all three dozen of which I've devoured in the last 12 months).</p>
<p>Mention of "my working years" introduces a fifth trend, as the three decades of my career in Internet technology and business recede into the past: a turn to a more contemplative way of life. Whether I think of it as Hindu vānaprastha or ancient Greek theōria, increasingly I am drawn more and more to research, reflection, and inquiry now that I am freed from the need for nonstop action.</p>
<p>Finally, and related to this contemplative turn, I've been exploring more deeply the vast world of music more. Playing music has always been my favorite form of meditation, ever since I first picked up guitar and bass in my early teens. Lately I've been studying music more seriously, delving further into harmony, listening deeply to pieces of music I'd like to understand (and where possible grasping them from the inside out by learning to play them on guitar or bass), doing a bit of composing, etc.</p>
<p>I expect all six of these trends to broaden and deepen in the coming years.</p>

<h2><a href="1927.html">Desert Island Books</a></h2>
<h3>2024-12-04</h3>
<p>My reading list contains hundreds of items. Indeed, I maintain multiple such lists, since some of them are dedicated to particular research topics or historical figures on which I plan to write books of my own, such as Pyrrho, Socrates, and Shakespeare. Periodically, however, I like to think about how I would cull my reading list down to absolute essentials if forced to do so. The general principle seems to be: which authors would I most want to interact with in future years, for the sake of learning, enjoyment, and contemplation?</p>
<p>Having pondered it again recently, I'd say that nowadays my desert island books would look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aristotle - Complete Works</li>
<li>Emily Dickinson - Complete Poems</li>
<li>Homer - Iliad, Odyssey</li>
<li>Lao Tzu - Tao Te Ching</li>
<li>Lin Yutang - The Importance of Living</li>
<li>Michel de Montaigne - Essays</li>
<li>Plato - Complete Dialogues</li>
<li>William Shakespeare - Complete Plays</li>
<li>Spinoza - Ethics</li>
<li>Henry David Thoreau - Walden</li>
<li>Walt Whitman - Leaves of Grass</li>
</ul>
<p>For the ancient Greek authors, I'd want both English translations and Greek originals. I'd also need some reference books: the OED, Webster's Dictionary of 1841, Smyth's Greek Grammar, Cunliffe's Lexicon of the Homeric Dialect, and the LSJ (standard dictionary of ancient Greek). Because some of these are published in multiple volumes, all told that's about thirty physical books.</p>
<p>Naturally this leaves out many, many books and authors that I'd like to explore or re-read, but difficult decisions would need to be made if I were shipped off to that mythical desert island...</p>

<h2><a href="1926.html">The Price of Wisdom</a></h2>
<h3>2024-12-01</h3>
<p>When Socrates was put on trial in Athens for corrupting the youth, part of his defense was that he never requested payment for attending to the concerns of other people and encouraging them to live a more virtuous, examined life; instead he came to people individually "like a father or elder brother" (Plato, Apology, 31b), acting out of care for their souls. In a little-noted passage in Nicomachean Ethics IX.1 (1164a33-b6), Aristotle seems to expand on this line of thinking. First he observes that in relationships founded on excellence of character - such as, say, the relationship of parent to child or elder sibling to younger sibling - the parties engage in good deeds toward each other and return favors through their own free choice and mutual commitment. Drawing an analogy between interpersonal love and the love of wisdom, he then says:</p>
<blockquote>And it seems to be this way too with those who have shared in philosophy, for its worth is not measured in money and no honor could be of equal weight with it, but perhaps it is enough, as with gods and one's parents, to give what is possible.</blockquote>
<p>If indeed Aristotle offered wise counsel to the people with whom he interacted philosophically (see my notes on Nicomachean Ethics X.9), it seems likely that he did this work as a gift and that, just as with Socrates before him, he did not ask to be paid - for wisdom is literally priceless and (like love and friendship) stands outside the monetary economy. However, those who benefited from his attentive care might have returned the favor by "giving what is possible", for instance by bestowing gifts upon him or honoring him in distinctive ways. Indeed, in the generation after Aristotle, Epicurus seems to have had a similar attitude, as captured in Vatican Saying #32: "Honoring a sage is itself a great good to the one who honors." Although I haven't looked, I think we could find similar quotes among the ancient Confucians, Taoists, Buddhists, Hindus, and Stoics.</p>
<p>Nowadays we find this way of thinking to be quite foreign, even impertinent: how dare you consider your services to be above remuneration, as if you're some kind of godlike sage? Given that Socrates referred to the people in his circle as friends (not students since he felt he had nothing to teach), the analogy of friendship might be more welcome. For instance, you don't pay a friend to meet you for lunch so that you can talk through a tough situation you're facing, yet sometime afterward (though not in a quid pro quo manner) you might give your friend an extra special gift. I suspect this is how many of the ancient philosophers conceived of the counsel and instruction they gave.</p>

<h2><a href="1925.html">Seeing Like an Ideology</a></h2>
<h3>2024-11-30</h3>
<p>In his classic book <cite>Seeing Like a State</cite>, James C. Scott describes numerous schemes by which what he calls "high-modernist" planners attempted to impose order on the perceived chaos of human societies: collectivized farms in Soviet Russia, compulsory villagization in parts of Africa, unworkable cities like Brasília, etc. All of these schemes to overcome the messy realities of human existence have been able to survive their own manifest failings only because of creative workarounds discovered through human inventiveness and practical know-how (which, borrowing an ancient Greek word that Homer used to describe the wily Odysseus, he calls mētis / μῆτις).</p>
<p>Because centralized planning and government control are so often accompanied and justified by an <em>ideology</em> (communism, fascism, nationalism, etc.), we might find it productive to apply Scott's insights directly to the realm of ideas. We can call this "seeing like an ideology". Let us consider a few quotes from the conclusion to Scott's book.</p>
<blockquote>The clarity of the high-modernist optic is due to its resolute singularity. Its simplifying fiction is that, for any activity or process that comes under its scrutiny, there is only one thing going on.</blockquote>
<p>As I've observed before, there's never just one cause. Because reality is complex, we can't ascribe every problem in society to political corruption, systemic racism, climate change, the patriarchy, income disparities, government overreach, the left-wing march through the institutions, or any other single factor. Further, we also can't pigeonhole any individual person as "only one thing" based on class, race, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, political affiliation, educational attainment, etc. Yet it seems to me that ideologies necessarily engage in just this sort of reductive simplification. The results are well described in another quote:</p>
<blockquote>Almost all strictly functional, single-purpose institutions have some of the qualities of sensory deprivation tanks used for experimental purposes. At the limit, they approach the great social control institutions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries: asylums, workhouses, prisons, and reformatories. We have learned enough of such settings to know that over time they can produce among their inmates a characteristic institutional neurosis marked by apathy, withdrawal, lack of initiative and spontaneity, uncommunicativeness, and intractability. The neurosis is an accommodation to a deprived, bland, monotonous, controlled environment that is ultimately stupifying. The point is simply that high-modernist designs for life and production tend to diminish the skills, agility, initiative, and morale of their intended beneficiaries.</blockquote>
<p>It strikes me that ideological movements, even absent their realization in institutions, can have a similarly stultifying effect. When everything personal is political, when everything individual is ideological, when (to paraphrase Mussolini) all is within the movement and nothing is outside the movement, then the emotional and intellectual life of the adherent becomes cramped, constrained, controlled, conforming, claustrophobic.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the ideology itself (if we can anthropomorphize such a thing), this is not a bug but a feature: in true binary fashion, a human being must be either an orthodox adherent or an archenemy. Moreover, it's not acceptable for adherents to be complex, because complexity is the nemesis of the reductive drive inherent in all ideologies. Yet complexity is the very essence of personhood. Thus I conclude that ideology is at root a <em>dehumanizing</em> phenomenon, just as its institutional counterparts are.</p>

<h2><a href="1924.html">Taking Notes</a></h2>
<h3>2024-11-26</h3>
<p>Since I seem to be on a roll writing about habits, I figured I'd mention another one: taking notes during meetings.</p>
<p>Over the last five years of my tech career, I got really good at this. It started when I used to volunteer as a scribe during industry standardization meetings at the IETF, wherein I would jot down the main discussion points and action items so that the working group chairs could provide a session summary to the conference proceedings. Over time, I started doing the same thing in my day job - especially at Mozilla, where I had a huge number of meetings with partners and it became difficult to keep track of it all.</p>
<p>Initially I did this in paper notebooks, but that method had a few major downsides. First, the resulting notes weren't searchable. Second, I can type way faster than I can write. My solution was to keep all my notes in text files on my computer, which I could search through using the `grep` utility at the Unix command line. (Yes, I'm a geek - more normal folks might use a dedicated note-taking app.) For each meeting, I would create a separate file named `partner-yyyy-mm-dd.txt`, thus making it easy to see the entire history of interactions. For each meeting, I would list the participants, write up major discussion points and decisions, list action items (prefaced by "TODO" for improved searchability). If I had time, I would quickly review and correct the notes after the meeting; if I had back-to-back meetings, as was often the case, I would try to do this at the end of the day while my memories were still fresh.</p>
<p>For our most important partners, we kept notes in shared documents, which was good for transparency and collaborative note-taking but more distracting for me because I find it convenient to type in a small terminal window tucked away in the bottom right corner of the screen while most of the screen is devoted to the video conferencing app where the meeting takes place.</p>
<p>Speaking of distracting, you might wonder: doesn't it annoy other participants if I'm typing away during a meeting? I'm a fairly noisy typist, but I've learned to type more quietly and I also mute myself when not speaking (here it helps to have a corded headset with a physical mute button).</p>
<p>Taking notes in this way really helped me to stay organized, follow through on my commitments, and communicate more effectively. If you give it a try, let me know how it goes.</p>
