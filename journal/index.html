<h2><a href="1935.html">Moving Slow</a></h2>
<h3>2025-02-08</h3>
<p>Several factors have conspired recently to slow down my pace of posting. Not only have I been working through a difficult and distracting family matter, but I've been questioning some of my existing commitments. Among other things, I've decided to conclude my philosophical coaching and startup advising activities. Although these were intriguing experiments and I enjoyed working with several people, I have my doubts about how truly helpful I was; more generally, I doubt that I am cut out for the helping professions. As a result, I'll be shutting down my philosopher.coach website and in the future posting only at stpeter.im (however, I won't rule out a move to Substack, at least for some of my mid-length writings).</p>
<p>Progress on my Aristotle book continues, but that has slackened, too. Because my powers of attention have been weak and scattered, all I've been doing of late is mindlessly typing passages from Aristotle's works into my searchable collection of book and article summaries. This will set me up for success six or twelve months from now when I expect to start writing in earnest, but it's not an inherently fulfilling task. C'est la vie.</p>
<p>On the plus side, to stay calm during this somewhat stressful time I've been engaging in my favorite form of meditation: playing guitar. I've been learning the <em>Trois Gymnopédies</em> of Erik Satie as arranged for classical guitar and, even better, I'm composing a short piece inspired by Satie (which I'm calling <em>Gymnosophie #1</em> in honor of the "naked wise men", likely early Buddhists, that Pyrrho and Alexander the Great visited in northwestern India 2300+ years ago). This piece started out as a simple essay in the Dorian mode but is gradually morphing into an exploration of harmonic ambiguity à la Fauré and Satie, with travels to distant keys and an eventual return to the home key of D. I'm not yet sure if it will come together successfully, but I've been enjoying the unhurried musical journey.</p>

<h2><a href="1934.html">Musical Wisdom</a></h2>
<h3>2025-01-20</h3>
<p>Most of our metaphors for knowing and thinking are based on the power of sight; for instance, the ancient Greek word eidenai means "to have seen", i.e., the past perfect of idein (whence our word "idea"). Less commonly, knowing is held to come from hearing what is said - especially hearing the word of god as in the Hebrew tradition. Yet all indications are that music predates language. What depths of wisdom could we sound if we were to base our metaphors on actively and collaboratively making music? Consider some of the primeval phenomena of music: the living pulse of rhythm and its resulting entrainment of the music makers; the importance of harmony,  both internal and interpersonal; the striving, movement, and completion of melodies and chord progressions. Beyond these fundamentals there is much more to explore: timbre and coloration in different instruments and keys, consonance and dissonance, the stretching of time in rubato and syncopation, tempo and its relation to human activities and emotions, improvisation and spontaneity, active listening and responding as crucial to cooperative music-making, making music as a form of meditation, and much else besides. I intend to ponder these matters as I delve more deeply into music in the years ahead.</p>

<h2><a href="1933.html">2024 Readings</a></h2>
<h3>2024-12-27</h3>
<p>By my count, I was able to read 95 books this year, not even accounting for the three epic poems I read twice: the <cite>Iliad</cite>, the <cite>Odyssey</cite>, and <cite>Beowulf</cite>. Highlights were the plays of Shakespeare (yes, all of them), George Eliot's magisterial novel <cite>Middlemarch</cite>, <cite>Bach and the Patterns of Invention</cite> by Laurence Dreyfus, an intensive re-reading of Aristotle's <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>, my friend Dave Jilk's poetic SF novel <cite>Epoch</cite>, and the aforementioned epic poems. I expect that I'll not read nearly so many books in 2025 while I attempt to finish writing my book about Aristotle's conception of human fulfillment.</p>
<p>P.S. I don't listen to audiobooks, so I've read all of these either as physical books (my preference) or as online books at my Monadnock Valley Press website (which I read on my mobile phone).</p>

<h2><a href="1932.html">Philokalia</a></h2>
<h3>2024-12-20</h3>
<p>Before I go deep on Aristotle, I figured I'd mention something I've been thinking about lately, which is aesthetics. Following up on some research I've been doing into the music of J.S. Bach for my "Meditations on Bach" project, I recently read a book about the founders of modern aesthetics during the German Enlightenment (Christian Wolff, Alexander Baumgarten, etc.). It turns out that these early thinkers saw aesthetics as a practical discipline; unlike post-Kantian philosophers of art who are interested in purely theoretical questions or, at best, epistemological justification of critical judgment, the originators of aesthetics wanted to spell out principles that would guide artists in the task of bringing more beauty into the world. Immediately I perceived parallels to philosophy as the personal love and practice of wisdom. Consulting my ancient Greek dictionary, I discovered the word φιλοκαλία / philokalia, which I would describe as the personal love and practice of beauty. This is a fascinating topic that I've sketched out in slightly more detail in a work-in-progress essay (I even subtitled it a "manifesto"), but I won't have time to dig into it much further until I complete my Aristotle book. So many projects, so little time...</p>

<h2><a href="1931.html">Looking Forward</a></h2>
<h3>2024-12-20</h3>
<p>Although I don't make New Year's resolutions, inevitably one does think about priorities as the year winds down. One realization I've come to recently is that I need to finish off more of my long-term projects. Because my Aristotle book is the farthest along (I've been researching it for five years!), I'm recommitting to it in hopes of completing a first draft by the end of 2025. This means that I'll have to cut back somewhat on blogging, pair reading, public-domain publishing at the Monadnock Valley Press, catching up on news and long-form cultural analysis, etc. Instead, I'll be reviewing the book and article summaries I've created, improving the outline, drafting and honing the text, identifying chapter epigraphs, and so on. Where appropriate, I'll continue to use my weblog to work out my thinking on various Aristotelian themes; however, I might be posting less frequently on other topics.</p>

<h2><a href="1930.html">Monadnock Valley Press Annual Report 2024</a></h2>
<h3>2024-12-20</h3>
<p>My publication activity at the Monadnock Valley Press waxes and wanes; 2022 was a busy year, 2023 was relatively quiet, and in 2024 I republished more works from the public domain than in any previous year since founding the site in 2008 (e.g., I published on 118 separate days this year, whereas the average in previous years was 18!). This time around the haul included:</p>
<ul>
<li>The complete plays of William Shakespeare.</li>
<li>Novels by Charlotte Brontë and Daniel Defoe.</li>
<li>Epic poems by Apollonius of Rhodes, Hesiod, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.</li>
<li>Non-fiction books by Aristotle, Boethius, Darwin, Erasmus, and Schiller.</li>
<li>Essays and addresses by John Adams, Matthew Arnold, Randolph Bourne, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Ben Franklin, William Hazlitt, David Hume, Thomas Jefferson, John Milton, Albert Jay Nock, George Santayana, Louis Sullivan, and Frederick Jackson Turner.</li>
<li>Several hundred poems by William Basse, William Blake, Louise Bogan, Anne Bradstreet, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, William Cullen Bryant, Robert Bridges, Lord Byron, Thomas Carew, William Collins, Abraham Cowley, George Crabbe, Samuel Daniel, John Dryden, George Eliot, Robert Frost, Thomas Gray, Robert Hillyer, Langston Hughes, Ben Jonson, John Keats, Richard Lovelace, Andrew Marvell, Edna St. Vincent Millay, John Milton, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Edmund Spenser, Thomas Traherne, Henry Vaughan, Edmund Waller, and William Wordsworth.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, 2025 will likely be much less prolific, since I have books of my own to write; I'll probably focus on works that help move my own projects forward, such as ancient Greek drama and history along with a few epic poems.</p>
