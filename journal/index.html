<h2><a href="1724.html">Have a Beautiful Life</a></h2>
<h3>2022-07-14</h3>
<p>Last week I explored how we might apply Aristotle's ideas about ethical beauty to the "micro level" of specific virtues and particular situations. This week I'd like to see how we might apply the same basic insights to the "macro level" of living a beautiful life.</p>
<p>Here again I'll consider Aristotle's six criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>Coherence (τάξις) is all about the arrangement of the parts of a thing. Several "things" seem relevant in this context. The first thing is what the ancients called the soul or ψυχή (my preferred translation is "aliveness"); Aristotle talked about the "nutritive soul" (physical needs like metabolism and growth, which we share even with the plants), the "perceptual soul" (wants engendered by the ability to perceive and move around in the world), and the "intellective soul" (wishes and imaginings made possible by the human faculty of λόγος = reason-and-speech). Finding the right balance or arrangement among these aspects of oneself contributes mightily to living well. The second thing is the various domains of life - health and vitality, achievement and purpose, relationships and caring, character and self-improvement, wisdom and learning, wonder and spirituality, etc. Here, too, generating deep coherence among them matters a great deal.</li>
<li>Proportion (συμμετρία) might be closely related to coherence, in the sense that most people don't want any particular aspect or pursuit to take up a disproportionate amount of time and energy. If all you do is, say, engage in physical exercise to stay healthy, then you might neglect other parts of life that need attention. However, what's proportionate for one person might not be proportionate for another: some folks really do focus most of their energies on just one or two aspects of life (say, great artists or scholars) and seem to be happy that way. Know thyself!</li>
<li>Order (τὸ ὡρισμένον) might involve a due ordering of your purposes in life: for instance, knowing what is valuable in itself vs. a means to an end. As an example, Aristotle argued that physical health is not a core constituent of eudaimonia but a precondition for the more fundamental pursuits involved in living a good life, such as relationships with other people. Similarly, he argued that wealth is not an end in itself.</li>
<li>Stature (μέγεθος) could be interpreted in terms of the scope or timespan involved in living well. A famous quote from Aristotle's <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> observes that "one swallow does not make a spring, nor does one day; and in the same way one day or a short time does not make a person blessed and happy". Achieving eudaimonia requires a lifelong approach to learning, self-improvement, relationships, and one's goals and purposes. That's stature.</li> 
<li>Unity (τὸ ὅλος) might imply what I like to translate as "wholeness" (αὐτάρκεια): a sense that your life isn't missing anything important; a related topic could be having a comprehensive understanding of life and your place in it, and applying that wisdom as unifying a force in your life.</li>
<li>Significance (σπουδαῖα) refers to the seriousness, significance, worth, and meaning of your life and the actions, projects, relationships, goals, and purposes that make it up. One of my favorite books about Aristotle's views on human flourishing is <cite>Taking Life Seriously</cite> by Francis Sparshott and that captures this idea quite well!</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, I'll note that these applications of Aristotle's ideas are quite speculative, but I hope you find them provocative for your own reflections.</p>

<h2><a href="1723.html">Beautifully Right</a></h2>
<h3>2022-07-07</h3>
<p>I seem to have fallen into a natural rhythm of alternating my posts between lighter and heavier topics; last week I talked about substitutions, so this week I figured I'd delve into something I touched on last year: what Aristotle means by acting for the sake of what is beautifully right.</p>
<p>It's fascinating that Aristotle uses the same word (καλός) to talk about both art and action. I render it as "beautifully right". Indeed, I believe that the so-called "doctrine of the mean" is merely a first approximation of good action and excellent character, since all it says is to avoid the extremes and instead pursue what's intermediate. A more precise formulation is to act for the sake of τὸ πρέπον or τὸ καλόν - for the sake of what is admirably appropriate or beautifully right.</p>
<p>How do we unpack this? As I explained in my post last year about the sources of beauty in Aristotle's philosophy (details there), five factors are involved, which I translate as coherence, proportion, order, stature, unity, and significance.</p>
<p>Let's see how these might apply to a specific situation, say generosity in helping a friend in need. Perhaps your friend is going through a difficult time in a relationship and could use several forms of assistance (e.g., moral support, legal advice, temporary financial support) over a period of a few months. How might we apply Aristotle's insights?</p>
<ol>
<li>Coherence (τάξις) refers to making all the parts of your assistance fit together well so that they are consistent, mutually reinforcing, and the like.</li>
<li>Proportion (συμμετρία) means ensuring that your actions correspond to your friend's need. Perhaps she could use a temporary loan of $1,000 to pay some emergency expenses - it isn't proportionate to lend her $100 or $10,000 (even if you could afford to do so).</li>
<li>Order (τὸ ὡρισμένον) is, to put it negatively, a lack of chaos; in this situation it might imply that you are steadfast in your support, that your emotional tone is consistent throughout your interactions, etc.</li>
<li>Stature (μέγεθος) refers to the magnitude of your generosity - perhaps ensuring that it is commensurate with how important this friendship is to you both and consistent with what you're realistically able to offer (perhaps you don't know anything about the legal issues but you can introduce her to a lawyer friend of yours).</li>
<li>Unity (τὸ ὅλος) captures an almost artistic sense that nothing is missing and that superfluous aspects are appropriately excluded (e.g., your friend needs moral, legal, and financial assistance but that doesn't mean you should buy her random gift cards, too).</li>
<li>Significance (σπουδαῖα) indicates that you take the matter seriously and act in a way that is deeply meaningful to the people involved.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are inklings that these criteria apply at the "macro" level of life in general as well as the "micro" level of particular situations, but I'll explore those in a future post.</p>
<p>I hasten to add that Aristotle doesn't spend a lot of time explaining these ideas in his writings, so this brief unpacking is speculative and intended to spur your own thinking. However, by doing this work we can see that there might be much more to Aristotle's ethical insights than "moderation in everything" (which he never said!). Instead, doing good involves discovering the practical truth in a given situation and then applying that knowledge by acting in a way that's admirably appropriate and beautifully right (by the way, this shows that Aristotle perceived a deep unity between the true, the good, and the beautiful). Not that any of this is easy, mind you, but at least Aristotle might have given us some guideposts along the way.</p>

<h2><a href="1722.html">RFC 9280: RFC Editor Model</a></h2>
<h3>2022-06-30</h3>
<p>Every year the RFC Editor publishes hundreds of technical specifications in the Request for Comments (RFC) Series. But who or what is the RFC Editor? Originally it was one person: Jon Postel. Over the years the editing and publishing role has expanded to include a team of people at the RFC Publishing Center (RPC). In addition, the policy aspects, along with day-to-day troubleshooting of contentious issues that arise during publication, have been handled by a person with the title of RFC Series Editor (RSE). These various roles and responsibilities have been looked after (at a high level, anyway) by the RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC), which reports to the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), which has had ultimate authority over the evolution of this model. If it sounds confusing and perhaps a little opaque, that's because it is. Therefore, over the last few years the IAB decided to revisit the underlying structure to improve transparency, clarify roles and responsibilities, and provide for greater community involvement. This work was completed through an open discussion process under the auspices of the IAB in the form of the RFC Editor Future Development Program. Because I'm a nice guy and because I'm good at helping to forge consensus, I volunteered to edit the Internet-Draft produced by this Program. The resulting document (of course it's an RFC, too!) has just been published as RFC 9280: RFC Editor Model (Version 3) - see my post at the IETF blog for more details.</p>

<h2><a href="1721.html">Substitutions</a></h2>
<h3>2022-06-30</h3>
<p>Almost ten years ago I wrote a blog post about my "to-don't list": the things that I deliberately don't do, such as watch TV, follow the news, go shopping for fun, or spend time on social media. In my experience sometimes it's relatively easy to cease such activities, but other times I need to substitute one activity for another.</p>
<p>As one example, consider the fact that many people spend their work days sitting at a desk and looking at a computer screen. It's widely known that sitting all day is hazardous to your health, but what's the substitute? Personally I've found that a stand-up desk is a great way to break the habit: typically I stand half the day and sit half the day. (Getting out for a walk helps, too.) As to looking at a computer screen, wherever possible I try to read on paper instead of the screen (e.g., I strive to read physical books instead of ebooks or web pages).</p>
<p>As a second example, I have always had a fondness for sweets, especially chocolate and ice cream. However, I am also fairly sugar-intolerant, so I need to avoid the sugar high one gets from eating such foods. Here I've found two substitutes: 100% cacao bars (no sugar but still chocolatey) and dried figs (only natural sugars and not too much of those).</p>
<p>As a third example, for about ten years I've been on a low-information diet, which entails not reading the news. When the pandemic kicked in I started to check the Wall Street Journal headlines once a day (I can't read the stories because I'm not a subscriber!), but even that was somewhat stressful and distracting for me. Thus over the last few months I've substituted reading poems for reading the news: not only are they short enough to read on the phone when I have a few moments to spare, but they're beautiful and thought-provoking, too (recently I've especially been enjoying the poetry of Robert Hillyer and Sara Teasdale).</p>
<p>I freely grant that substitutions like these might be easier for me because I have a low stimulation threshold, which essentially means that I don't need much excitement in my life. As I like to say: "Dare to be Dull!" :-)</p>

<h2><a href="1720.html">Socrates and Thoreau</a></h2>
<h3>2022-06-23</h3>
<p>My favorite quote from Henry David Thoreau runs as follows:</p>
<blockquote>There are nowadays professors of philosophy, but not philosophers. Yet it is admirable to profess because it was once admirable to live. To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically.</blockquote>
<p>A paper recently published in <cite>The Concord Saunterer: A Journal of Thoreau Studies</cite> ("Finding <cite>Walden</cite> in Emerson's Plato" by Mark Gallagher) sheds light on the ancient roots of Thoreau's conception of the philosopher. During his time at Walden Pond, Thoreau occasionally perused Emerson's copy of Plato's dialogues as translated by Floyer Sydenham and Thomas Taylor in 1804. On the margins of page 336 of volume 1, Gallagher found a curious sketch of a small house, which looks like the house that Thoreau built at the pond. On the same page, someone (Thoreau?) underlined some significant words in the following passage from Book VI of Plato's <cite>Republic</cite> (499e-500a):</p>
<blockquote>Do not thus altogether accuse the multitude; but, whatever opinion they may have, without upbraiding them, but rather encouraging them, and revoking the reproach thrown on philosophy, <u>point out to them the persons you call philosophers, and define distinctly, as at present, both their genius and their pursuits, that they may not think you speak of such as they call philosophers.</u>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Socrates draws a distinction between those whom most people would identify as philosophers (back then, Sophists; nowadays, professors and other big idea people) and those who really <em>are</em> philosophers. The difference is that the real philosophers live according to the dictates of wisdom. Gallagher argues that Socrates was not only a model for Thoreau's portrait of the ideal philosopher, but that <em>Walden</em> can be seen as an apologia for Thoreau's way of life in Concord - much as Plato's <cite>Apology</cite> was a defense of Socrates' way of life in Athens.</p>
<p>These insights give us a fresh perspective on Thoreau's <em>Walden</em>, which is perhaps the greatest book of philosophy as a way of life in the modern era. If I ever get around to publishing a second edition of my book <cite>The Upland Farm: Thoreau on Cultivating a Better Life</cite>, I'll strive to place these connections into even stronger relief.</p>

<h2><a href="1719.html">That Flourishing Feeling</a></h2>
<h3>2022-06-16</h3>
<p>Positive psychology is sometimes perceived as putting a premium on pleasant experiences - what critics call "happiology". Yet just because pleasure is a positive experience doesn't mean it's the only positive experience!</p>
<p>Yes, it's true that thinkers as ancient as Socrates and Aristotle have maintained that people who flourish also experience greater enjoyment in life. However, it seems to me that the personal experience of eudaimonia is much more intriguing and varied than mere hedonics. Consider Aristotle's claim that the objective conditions of eudaimonia produce subjective experiences of greater tranquility, stability of personal identity, harmony between reason and emotion, lack of significant regrets over one's actions, internal coherence or "being of one mind", evaluations that one's life is valuable and lacks nothing of significance, etc. Modern thinkers have added to this list, as for instance with the late Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's concept of deep engagement in one's activities (see his book <cite>Flow</cite>) and Daniel Haybron's exploration of qualities such as attunement with one's environment and a sense of expansiveness (see his book <cite>The Pursuit of Unhappiness</cite>). Generating a comprehensive description of the feelings of flourishing would be a fascinating research project for someone who is so inclined...</p>
