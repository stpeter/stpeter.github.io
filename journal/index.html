<h2><a href="1954.html">Romanticism Reconsidered</a></h2>
<h3>2025-04-18</h3>
<p>To follow up on last month's post "Romanticism or Renaissance?", I decided to read two books by scholars for whom I have a great deal of respect: <cite>Classic, Romantic, and Modern</cite> by cultural historian Jacques Barzun and <cite>The Roots of Romanticism</cite> by intellectual historian Isaiah Berlin. Although I'm far from sagely on these matters now, I do feel somewhat better informed.</p>
<p>Barzun states at one point that "Romantic striving may therefore be summed up as the effort to create order out of experience individually acquired." This "implies that the primary reality is the individual"and that order is not merely theoretical or handed to one from on high but must be created by the individual to serve the individual (or, on some interpretations, a group or nation). This "in turn suggests that the first law of the universe is not thought but action" - which "means effort, energy, possibly strife and certainly risk." The Romantics felt that the old world had run its course and that the challenge was now "to create a new world on the ruins of the old" - a world not of absolute aesthetic rules and moral codes followed to the letter, but of novel values invented and pursued. In the arts, the result was unrestrained observation and imagination, spurring a diversity of creations that were "simultaneously idealistic, realistic, and symbolic" (Barzun argues - paradoxically to our modern ears - that Romanticism was not opposed to "Realism, Symbolism, Impressionism, Naturalism, and Post-Impressionism" but contained within itself the seeds of these later movements). Indeed, because of its respect for facts, experience, activity, and the passions of life, Barzun boldly claims that "romanticism <em>is</em> realism", for the Romanticists "sought and found ... not a dream world into which to escape, but a real world in which to live."</p>
<p>Berlin finds similarly idealistic values in the Romantic movement: "integrity, sincerity, readiness to sacrifice one's life to some inner light, dedication to some ideal for which it is worth sacrificing all that one is, for which it is worth both living and dying." Yet taken too far this leads to "the Nietzschean figure who wishes to raze to the ground a society whose system of values is such that a superior person who truly understands what it is to be free cannot operate in terms of it, and therefore prefers to destroy it." Berlin traces such ideas not to England around 1805 or France around 1825, but to Germany around 1775, specifically in the persons of Johann Herder and his "master" Johann Hamann, the "Magus of the North" as he was known. The view and practice of art that resulted from these currents put a premium on the living expression and unique voice of an original personality and creative genius: "to stop expressing is to stop living", "to live is to do something", "to do is to express your nature" - an "infinite nature to soar to greater and greater heights and become wider, deeper, freer, more vital, more like the divinity towards which it strives." Yet Berlin uncovers a more pessimistic strain as well, according to which one's nature is inexpressible, one's ideals are unattainable, dark forces prevent us from finding true freedom, and so on.</p>
<p>My initial foray into cultural and intellectual history leaves me with two questions.</p>
<p>First, what led to the birth and development of Romanticism? If Berlin is right, its roots were planted before the French Revolution in reaction to the overbearing rationalism of the Enlightenment, which imposed a simplistic account of human experience, a superficial universalism that stifled individuality, and an over-emphasis on rules and manners - all the while refusing to criticize in any fundamental way a hollowed-out social system overseen by corrupt monarchs and aristocrats.</p>
<p>Second, are we ripe for a Romantic resurgence? Here I'm not so sure that history is about to rhyme. I suppose one could argue that our tottering system of rule by the experts (who often are merely the credentialed) is overly rationalistic and universalistic, and furthermore that the emerging technopoly is becoming literally inhuman through the expectation that people will conform to the outputs of so-called "artificial intelligence" programs. Yet it seems to me that our world is also characterized by a witches' brew of atomistic self-indulgence, anything-goes irrationalism, and a nihilistic pursuit of fame, riches, power, and prestige that would make Machiavelli blush. The antidotes to <em>that</em> aren't fully clear to me, but I suggest they will involve leaving behind the artificial for the human, the political for the personal, the fake for the real - even, if you will, the art of the deal for the art of the ideal.</p>
<p>If this be Romanticism, make the most of it.</p>

<h2><a href="1953.html">The Nation of Many Nations</a></h2>
<h3>2025-04-15</h3>
<p>In <cite>Song of Myself</cite>, Walt Whitman declared himself to be "one of the great nation, the nation of many nations" - claiming identity as a northerner and a southerner, a Yankee, a Kentuckian, a Hoosier, a Badger, a Buckeye, and a habitan of numerous other places in North America. (Whitman contained multitudes, after all!)</p>
<p>Aside from its 50 states and many larger and smaller regions, there is another, greater sense in which America is the nation of many nations: it has become a home for people from all over the world. First of these, of course, were the Native Americans, who were here before everyone else and whose tragedies and triumphs are ongoing. Long millennia later the British showed up, but the British were themselves a people of many cultures, with ancestral streams from the Celts, Romans, Angles, Saxons, Vikings, Norman French, etc. In his magisterial history <cite>Albion's Seed</cite>, David Hackett Fischer described the nature of America's founding cultures in great detail: dissenting Puritans who came from East Anglia to New England; low-church Anglican cavaliers and indentured servants who came from Wessex and Sussex to Virginia and the Carolinas; Quakers who came from the North Midlands to the Delaware Valley; and Presbyterians who came from Ulster and the Scottish-English Borderland to the Appalachian backcountry.</p>
<p>But that was merely the beginning. Fischer has since written a book about America's African founders (which I've not yet read). Russell Shorto has written several books about the influence of the Dutch upon New Amsterdam, which became our greatest city. These early migrations to mainland America have been followed over the centuries by significant influxes from Germany, Sweden, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, French Canada (both Québec and Acadia), China, Poland, Japan, Puerto Rico, Cuba, the Philippines, the many islands of the Caribbean, Vietnam, Mexico, India, Nigeria - the list goes on. No doubt books have been written about each one of these, and it would be fascinating to explore them all.</p>
<p>This gives me the idea of writing a long, Whitmanesque poem - perhaps entitled "Song of the Nations" - celebrating the contributions of people from all over the world to American history and culture. Yet another of my many projects...</p>

<h2><a href="1952.html">Four Causes of Fulfillment</a></h2>
<h3>2025-04-11</h3>
<p>Aristotle is famous, or infamous, for what is known as his doctrine of the four causes. As I’ve explained before, there are many misconceptions about these matters, but I’ll go with the traditional description for the purpose of this somewhat fanciful post about what causes an examined life of wisdom and fulfillment.</p>
<p>First is the material cause. This is that “out of which” a thing is made: a tree is made out of wood, a syllable is made out of letters, an argument is made out of premises, and a play is made out scenes. Similarly, life is made out of words and deeds, actions and emotions, projects and relationships, and everything else one experiences between birth and death. Thus metaphorically we can say that experience provides the wood.</p>
<p>Second is the efficient cause. This is that “from which” a change or motion begins: parents make a child, a builder (or the craft of house-building) makes a house, and so on. What is the efficient cause of a lifetime of seeking wisdom and fulfillment? Following Socrates and Plato, Aristotle says that it’s the experience of wonder about the mysteries of life and the universe. Thus metaphorically we can say that, after experience provides the wood, wonder lights the spark for good.</p>
<p>Third is the formal cause. This is “what it is to be something” - something’s identity or, more generally, its way of being. An example that Aristotle uses is the octave in music: what it is to be an octave is to have a ratio of two to one. A more familiar example might be a house, for which the formal cause is the architectural plan according to which the house was built. What forms a life of wisdom and fulfillment? At the highest level, Aristotle says it is philosophy, for as Pierre Hadot observed the purpose of philosophy is not to inform us but to form us. Thus metaphorically we can say that the love of wisdom shapes the flame of our pursuit of deep fulfillment in life.</p>
<p>Fourth is the final cause. This is that “for the sake of which” something acts within its way of being or, especially (since living beings are the paradigmatic entities), its way of life. Sometimes this is a conscious purpose, but Aristotle argues that even things like trees and insects have aims because the things they do (e.g., metabolic functions) are for the sake of the entity’s continued existence. In human life, Aristotle holds that the highest purpose is doing what is beautiful and thus emulating or enacting the most divine aspects of existence. Thus metaphorically we can say that, once the spark has been lit, beauty is the fire’s aim.</p>
<p>We can summarize these insights in a poetic quatrain:</p>
<blockquote>
Experience provides the wood,<br>
Then wonder lights the spark for good;<br>
The love of wisdom shapes the flame,<br>
For beauty is the fire’s aim.<br>
</blockquote>

<h2><a href="1951.html">He Who Pays the Piper Calls the Tune</a></h2>
<h3>2025-04-09</h3>
<p>Recently my alma mater, Columbia University, was back in the news because the Trump administration threatened to withhold $400 million in federal grants until the university changed some of its internal polocies. The political responses were predictable: populists were pleased about sticking it to leftist academics, faculty fulminated about threats to their intellectual freedom, the interim president lost her job over decisions she made, and a few folks quietly wondered about the wisdom of federal funding for so much educational activity and scientific research.</p>
<p>Because all that political stuff is far outside my influence and control, my reaction is more personal and philosophical: an event like this reinforces my policy of what I call self-patronage. I have always funded my intellectual and artistic endeavors through my own independent means, never through academic positions, think-tank paychecks, non-profit grants, wealthy patrons, crowdfunded donations, paid subscriptions, or anything other than the money I earned in my business career. As I see it, one can’t maintain true freedom of thought - the deep foundation underlying mere freedom of speech - if someone else is footing the bill.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, those who are now surprised that a new paymaster might make new demands forgot the wisdom of an ancient saying: <em>he who pays the piper calls the tune</em>.</p>

<h2><a href="1950.html">Where I Stand</a></h2>
<h3>2025-04-08</h3>
<p>Spurred by Garry Kasparov's call for a positive vision of the free society, Arnold Kling posted a list of the causes he is for. It seems like a good idea to reflect on these matters from time to time - perhaps especially at this time. Therefore - while recognizing both that I'm politically powerless and that my views have significance only for me - here I'll very briefly set out ten principles that I hold to be important in the political realm.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ethics. My ideal president is George Washington, a leader who had the highest principles of personal conduct along with an unwavering devotion to public service.</li>
  <li>Freedom. The American ideals espoused in the Declaration of Independence are eminently worth preserving, fighting for, and extending to more aspects of our society.</li>
  <li>Opportunity. Too many Americans have precious little opportunity to advance in life because of horrendous schools, unsafe neighborhoods, welfare programs that actively discourage moving up into the middle class, etc. We pay lip service to addressing these problems, but to our shame we haven't made real progress.</li>
  <li>Flourishing. A flourishing society requires flourishing individuals, families, and communities - in other words, prioritizing the general welfare, not demagogues, oligarchs, and special interests.</li>
  <li>Moderation. Aristotle said that law is reason codified, and that those who rule must be servants and protectors of the laws. This requires not only the ability to reason well about the common good, but a dedication to being reasonable.</li>
  <li>Effective governance. Our system of government has become ineffective at all levels, but especially at the federal level. Governments are trying to do too many things - and doing a poor job on most of them. We could use a lot more of Adam Smith's "peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice".</li>
  <li>Federalism and localism. To be effective, governance should happen much closer to the people. All functions except those explicitly ceded to the federal government in the Constitution should be performed by states, cities, towns, counties, neighborhoods, and voluntary associations of all kinds.</li>
  <li>Pluralism. From the very beginning, America has contained many different regions, ethnicities, religions, ideologies, and cultures. Like a jazz big band, these different "sections" come together to make beautiful but sometimes cacophonous music. Let's cherish and nurture it.</li>
  <li>Brotherhood. We Americans are all in this together; despite our differences, we should have a common regard for each other and a common commitment to the never-ending mission of realizing our American ideals in practice.</li>
  <li>A free world. It's a legacy of our revolution that America has always been a beacon of freedom; we should live up to that promise by working with our friends and allies around the globe and by welcoming law-abiding, freedom-loving people from all over the world to join the American project.</li>
</ol>
<p>At least that's how I see things now...</p>

<h2><a href="1949.html">Talking vs. Thinking</a></h2>
<h3>2025-04-07</h3>
<p>A friend and I have begun a pair reading of <cite>The Faith of a Heretic</cite> by Walter Kaufmann. It's the second time through for both of us and we have mutual admiration for Kaufmann, so we're excited about digging into this most personal of Kaufmann's books on philosophy and religion.</p>
<p>Here in the early going, I was struck by this paragraph in a section on intellectual honesty:</p>
<blockquote>Perhaps the single best example of the common lack of high standards in questions of honesty is our tendency to think in labels. Terms like existentialism, pragmatism, and empiricism, liberalism and conservatism are, more often than not, so many excuses for not considering individual ideas on their merits and for not exposing oneself to the bite of thought. For less educated people, words like Jew and Catholic, Democrat, Republican, and Communist do much the same job. These labels have some uses that are perfectly legitimate, but frequently they function as an aid to thoughtlessness and permit people to appear to <em>think</em> when they are merely talking.</blockquote>
<p>There's an awful lot of "merely talking" in the world, isn't there? In my life I've been just as guilty as the next person, but I've been striving to leave labels, isms, epithets, and slogans behind me. It's surprisingly hard work!</p>
<p>One of my methods is what I call encountering - deeply reading and considering the complete works of particular thinkers from the past. A good example is Thoreau. Having read everything he wrote, I have to wonder: Was Thoreau a transcendentalist? What does the label even mean? Could it be that, despite some similarities (what Wittgenstein might call "family resemblances"), lumping Thoreau in together with Kant, Fichte, Schelling, Swedenborg, Böhme, Carlyle, Coleridge, and the like actually lessens our understanding of Thoreau's individuality and multifarious insights?</p>
<p>Although encountering in my sense is a number of steps beyond steelmanning, unfortunately it takes extreme discipline and dedication - one might have time for only half a dozen encounters in life. I'm hopeful that Kaufmann's example and suggestions might help me discover thinking practices that aren't quite so intensive.</p>
