<h2><a href="1830.html">Tragedy vs. Atrocity</a></h2>
<h3>2023-11-16</h3>
<p>Ever since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, I've been bothered by a point of language. All too often (most recently in relation to the October 7 pogrom in Israel), people say that such events are a tragedy, but this is not correct because it implicitly relieves the participants of moral responsibility. A pogrom, a massacre, a terrorist attack, a genocide - these are not tragedies, they are atrocities. Yes, it's a tragic <em>situation</em> that, say, there was until very recently an Armenian exclave within the borders of Azerbaijan; but the <em>act</em> of forcibly expelling those Armenians was an atrocity. The same applies to pogroms of Russian Jews in the 19th and 20th centuries, Turkey's genocide of Armenians during World War I, the Holocaust against European Jews carried out by Nazi Germany with the collaboration of other fascist regimes, the Rwandan genocide of Tutsi people by Hutu militias in 1994, and so many other acts of collective violence throughout human history. We could even say it's tragic that human beings are so prone to atrocities, but moral responsibility for the atrocities themselves must be assigned to the people who instigate and participate in them. Precision on this point is extremely important, as a matter of both linguistic accuracy and ethical clarity.</p>

<h2><a href="1829.html">RFC 9525: Service Identity in TLS</a></h2>
<h3>2023-11-08</h3>
<p>In November of 2002, I attended my first meeting of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the premier standards-setting organization for the Internet. Since that initial exposure at IETF 55 in Atlanta, I have chaired working groups, run Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions, acted as an expert reviewer, and served on the Internet Engineering Steering Group and the RFC Series Oversight Committee. As of today, I've also authored 49 documents in the IETF's Request for Comments (RFC) series, which puts me in roughly the top 1% of RFC authors. The RFC published today is an updated specification for verifying the identity of servers in the context of Transport Layer Security, which is the primary protocol for protecting communication over the Internet (think the 's' in 'https'). I co-authored the previous version of this document (RFC 6125) with Jeff Hodges and this new version with Rich Salz, both of whom were a pleasure to work with. Although I still have a few residual IETF commitments, this RFC will in all likelihood be the last one I author, since my writing energy is now devoted to philosophy books, not technical specifications. At least I'm going out with a bang, because this document (along with RFC 9325, which I also co-authored) is cited by well over a hundred other RFCs and thus plays a significant role in helping to keep the Internet secure.</p>

<h2><a href="1828.html">Be Careful What You Measure</a></h2>
<h3>2023-10-27</h3>
<p>In business, it's often said that "if you can't measure it, you can't manage it." This aphorism is frequently attributed to Peter Drucker, although wrongly; instead it's pulled from a saying by quality expert W. Edwards Deming, despite the fact that his point was the exact opposite: "It is wrong to suppose that if you can't measure it, you can't manage it â€“ a costly myth."</p>
<p>Yet this costly myth not only persists but causes damage far beyond the business world. Consider a recent essay by research scientist Peter Gray, in which he offers a compelling argument that the significant rise in teen suicide since 2008 can be attributed largely to a misguided culture of measurement in American schools. Specifically, in response to the No Child Left Behind legislation passed in 2001, students (and thus indirectly their teachers and schools) have been measured incessantly through standardized tests, causing ubiquitous teaching to the test and endless pressure on students to perform, perform, perform. Aside from causing thousands of deaths by suicide, all this testing doesn't even measure anything meaningful, for a full understanding of the world around us isn't something that a standardized test can quantify.</p>
<p>Here's a much more ancient example: the Nicene Creed. In the early Christian community, the emerging orthodoxy felt keen competition from the Gnostics, who emphasized the gradual attainment of wisdom and spiritual insight. That was too much work for the orthodox, who instituted something much simpler: a creed which anyone could recite, whether mindfully or mindlessly - but if they didn't, they could be quickly dismissed as a heretic. Aside from causing several genocidal atrocities such as the Albigensian crusade, the Nicene Creed doesn't even measure anything meaningful, for authentic wisdom and spirituality can be judged only through intensive - I would even say loving - interaction among the individuals involved.</p>
<p>These are only two examples that illustrate a more general maxim: be careful what you measure!</p>

<blockquote>A human being, when completely developed, is the best of animals - but, when separated from law and justice, is the worst of them all ... without virtue, a human being is the most unholy and most savage of animals. - Aristotle</blockquote>
<p>The genocidal atrocities committed last weekend against Israeli citizens by thousands of Hamas terrorists are literally unspeakable. No words, and certainly no words I can say, have the power to heal such monstrous wounds. Yet one must not remain silent.</p>
<p>It is often said that civilization is merely a thin veneer over the baser impulses of humankind. To the contrary, I believe that many intertwining fibers protect us from becoming the most unholy and most savage of animals: among them law, custom, justice, virtue, reason, truth, discourse, persuasion, commerce, science, art, culture, history, tolerance, moderation, humanity, and simple decency. Tragically, some societies seem to lack many of these qualities and practices, some individuals within those societies are all too willing to exploit that fact by fomenting the most despicable ideologies imaginable, and other individuals within those societies are all too willing to abdicate their responsibility to be human by following despotic demagogues beyond criminality and beyond barbarity, thus descending into pure, unadulterated evil.</p>
<p>What can one person do in the face of acts that so fundamentally violate all human norms and ideals? Aside from speaking out and providing assistance from afar, I see one possibility: more deeply committing oneself to the qualities and practices that make us not the worst but the best of living things. At root, it is only by building up a culture of human fulfillment, both individually and cooperatively, that we can overcome this kind of savagery. Not once and for all, because that is impossible, but here in our own world. The task is ours and the time is now.</p>

<h2><a href="1826.html">Aristotle Research Report #19: The Nature of Life</a></h2>
<h3>2023-10-13</h3>
<p>Aristotle was the first biologist. Sadly, even though around one-third of his extant writings are devoted to living things, few of his interpreters take the biological basis of Aristotle's philosophy very seriously. This despite the fact that Charles Darwin said in a late letter that his "two gods" Linnaeus and Cuvier were "mere school-boys to old Aristotle"! It's a shame that Darwin didn't live long enough to study and comment on Aristotle's biological writings.</p>
<p>One of Aristotle's deep insights into living organisms is that they act for their own sake, in two senses. First, an organism's activities <em>benefit</em> it. Second, its activities serve a <em>purpose</em> within the organism's way of life. This two-fold "for-the-sake-of" relationship applies exclusively to living organisms, because only by staying alive do they remain in existence, and the process of living simply <em>is</em> activity. (Contrast such a living organism with a natural but inanimate object; for instance, we can say that a lake is full of life, but the lake itself is not alive and it does not act for its own sake - only the plants and fishes and birds that live in and around the lake do that.)</p>
<p>Here I make a digression into the topic of causation...</p>
<p>Although this "for-the-sake-of" relationship is in fact quite straightforward and scientific, throughout intellectual history there has been great confusion about it. With regard to the beneficiary of action, some interpreters have claimed that <em>only</em> the organism itself can benefit, a kind of psychological egoism that is entirely absent in Aristotle (e.g., in his biology reproduction is a core instance of action that benefits an organism and in his ethics the shared activities that feature so prominently in love, friendship, and community are the highest applications of personal virtue).</p>
<p>With regard to activities serving a purpose within an organism's way of life, medieval notions of so-called final causation (a term Aristotle never uses) have misled interpreters into believing that Aristotle claimed future states could "reach back in time" to cause earlier events. Similarly, medieval notions of teleology (another term Aristotle never uses) have led interpreters to attribute consciously held purposes to all living organisms, even plants and pre-conceptual animals; failing that, such interpreters have believed that such purposes must exist somewhere, so they've attributed them to an all-powerful creator.</p>
<p>Yet there is no more mysticism in saying that an activity "serves a purpose" within an organism's way of life than there is in talking about "forces" in physics or "bonds" in chemistry. Consider, for example, the play behaviors of nearly all mammals and some other animals. As professor Peter Gray and others have explored in depth, such behaviors serve the purpose of preparing young animals for the physical, perceptual, and social challenges of adulthood. But an adolescent fox, for instance, doesn't form the conscious purpose of self-improvement before engaging in play behavior, nor does a mature fox cause its earlier play behaviors through some sort of backward causation.</p>
<p>Returning to the main thread, the conditional nature of existence for living organisms has significant implications for biology, psychology, and human ethics. The impact varies depending on which sense of "life" we're talking about, because in ancient Greek there were (at least) three terms of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Î¶Ï‰Î® (whence zoology) - life-activities or life-processes</li>
<li>Î²Î¯Î¿Ï‚ (whence biology) - way of life</li>
<li>ÏˆÏ…Ï‡Î® (whence psychology) - the breath of life, thus aliveness</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll explore these implications more fully in future journal entries, and in my forthcoming book <cite>Complete Yourself: Aristotle on Human Fulfillment</cite>.</p>

<h2><a href="1825.html">Sentience and Salience</a></h2>
<h3>2023-09-30</h3>
<p>As you might have guessed from yesterday's post about opinion machines, I'm skeptical that so-called artificial intelligence systems will exhibit sentience anytime soon. Thus, although my primary concern is how humans will act in relation to these systems (even more personally, how <em>I</em> will act), I figure it can't hurt to sketch out my thinking on the broader topic.</p>
<p>The perspective I've taken so far is heavily influenced by Wallace Matson's book <cite>Sentience</cite>, which I first read in college and recently revisited.  Matson argues that the core skill underlying sentience is what he calls "sizing things up". Indeed, he states explicitly that this idea is an updated version of Aristotle's concept of nous, which I typically translate as "insight". To my mind, <em>insight</em> involves <em>seeing in</em> a situation what is most salient or significant - as we also say, getting a read on things, grasping their meaning, making sense of them, predicting where they might lead, and so on.</p>
<p>It seems to me that sizing things up is intimately bound up with a whole range of human capacities: memory, foresight, recognizing patterns, envisioning possibilities, drawing inferences, perceiving subtleties of behavior in humans and other animals, etc. Yet activating these cognitive capacities also connects them with emotional reactions, intentionality, valuation, goals, commitments, and meaning in general. Ultimately, sizing up is a <em>biological</em> phenomenon that leads to a judgment about whether a situation might be threatening or advantageous, painful or pleasant, for or against one's interests.</p>
<p>Consistent with both Aristotle's philosophy of biology and modern biological thought, there's no hard cutoff point where we can say definitively that humans size things up but other animals don't. It's pretty clear to me that mammals, birds, and even insects recognize the significance and implications of various situations for their survival and well-being. Sure, the range of such situations might be narrower along various dimensions (e.g., subtlety, physical distance, futurity), but that's a difference in degree, not in kind.</p>
<p>Will artificial intellegences ever have a rich experience of sentience, given that it seems to be rooted in the phenomenon of life? Hell if I know, but so far I'm skeptical. Eventually perhaps, but in the meantime I'm more interested in cultivating deeper sentience in natural intelligences. After all, that's hard enough!</p>
