<h2><a href="1785.html">George Winston, RIP</a></h2>
<h3>2023-06-07</h3>
<p>I was saddened yesterday to learn (via my friend Wayne Bethanis) that pianist-composer George Winston has died. Every solo performer of original music - not just pianists but guitarists and everyone else - owes him a debt of gratitude, for he was one of the few who blazed the trail of modern instrumental music, starting with his album <cite>Autumn</cite> in 1980. Although his music was often called "new age", he preferred the evocative term "rural folk piano". Many streams came together in his music: folk, blues, jazz, classical, rock, gospel, rhythm and blues, Hawaiian, and more. Yet he fused them into a seamless whole that was uniquely his own.</p>
<p>George Winston truly lived music as a way of life. Long ago I saw him perform at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City; in his flannel shirt and woolen socks, he was not dressed like a typical performer, but his utmost dedication to the music was evident from the first note to the last.</p>
<p>In my youth, I spent many, many hours listening to his albums <cite>Autumn</cite>, <cite>Winter Into Spring</cite>, and <cite>December</cite>, which were a significant influence on my own attempts at composing music for solo guitar; if I ever get around to recording these pieces, it will be in part to pay homage to the incomparable artistry of George Winston.</p>

<h2><a href="1784.html">Aristotle on Fulfillment</a></h2>
<h3>2023-06-01</h3>
<p>The more deeply I ponder Aristotle's conception of eudaimonia (usually translated as "happiness" or more recently sometimes as "flourishing"), the more radical it seems.</p>
<p>For instance, we are perfectly comfortable saying things like "that basil plant is much happier since we moved it to the windowsill" or "their daughter is really flourishing in her new school"; by contrast, Aristotle refused to attribute eudaimonia to plants or animals or even to children.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, it's complicated, but to simplify matters somewhat I'll say that it's bound up with his views on actualizing potential (or activating capacities) and what it means to achieve fulfillment, since he sees important differences here between humans and non-human animals, and between mature and immature humans.</p>
<p>The first level of fulfillment for a living being consists of the natural capacities to engage in the activities that comprise the way of life for beings of that kind (e.g., the power of sight, which is made possible by having eyes). The second level of fulfillment consists of activating and exercising those capacities (e.g., actually using the eyes to see). In his works on zoology, Aristotle calls the biological affordances for action (e.g., eyes or hands) organs, and in Greek organ means tool; thus the second level of fulfillment consists in a being's using its natural tools for living.</p>
<p>Life is more sophisticated for human beings because we have what Aristotle calls a kind of second nature: our character. It's true that further levels of fulfillment are open to human beings because we possess further powers such as reason, speech, imagination, culture, social learning, forethought, planning, goals, purposes, and deliberation. But those powers are volitional: human fulfillment is a matter of choice, commitment, and deliberate self-development.</p>
<p>Here again Aristotle focuses on two varieties of fulfillment: capacities and their activation. Thus the third level of fulfillment consists of the acquired dispositions that comprise the virtues of thought and character, and the fourth level consists of the active application of those virtues to the practices of living well, i.e., reliably choosing to act and feel in ways that are beautifully right in the many and various situations that one faces in life. It is this fourth level of fulfillment that Aristotle refers to as eudaimonia: not merely living, but living well.</p>
<p>Although a non-human animal can objectively flourish and experience some of the simpler pleasures of existence, according to Aristotle it does not achieve the highest level of fulfillment because its psyche is not suffused with (to put it briefly) thought and purpose and meaning. Similarly, although a child is on the way to being capable of the highest level of fulfillment, completely activating that capacity takes many years of learning, practice, reflection, and the kinds of choices and commitments that build up the mature self as the achievement of a lifetime.</p>
<p>Even this condensed summary indicates that the biological and anthropological foundations of Aristotle's conception of eudaimonia establish a meaning that goes far deeper than our superficial notion of happiness as positive feeling, subjective well-being, or utilitarian pleasure. We moderns think we know it all, but old Aristotle still has a great deal to teach us about human fulfillment.</p>

<h2><a href="1783.html">Ways of Life and Lines of Work</a></h2>
<h3>2023-06-01</h3>
<p>Because labor is so central to human existence, throughout history various thinkers have speculated about what the Buddhist eightfold path calls "right livelihood" for those who would seek and practice wisdom. For instance, both the Stoic Musonius Rufus and the Confucian Wu Yubi advocated subsistence farming as a noble line of work. The Taoist sage Chuang Tzu tells a beautiful story about the artistry of a lowly butcher. Although officially Aristotle downplayed the value of mechanical pursuits like housebuilding and even music-making, nevertheless he frequently used craftsmen as models of practical thinking and he applied the lessons of craftsmanship to ethical reflection. In recent times, Matthew Crawford titled one of his books "shop class as soul craft" and has argued that working in the trades enables you to bring your whole self to your productive activities. And so on.</p>
<p>It's been said that there is something especially fulfilling or even honest about working with your hands. At one level that makes sense, because so much about a human way of life depends on our hands (we are tool-makers who manage and manipulate things, and we even speak of grasping ideas). Yet other aspects of human existence are nearly as fundamental, such as our social interactions and our conceptual-linguistic abilities; although some folks prefer working with things, others prefer working with people or with symbols.</p>
<p>Moreover, recent research in the social sciences (e.g., by Amy Wrzesniewski and colleagues) indicates that three attitudes toward work are nearly ubiquitous: seeing work as a job, as a career, or as a calling. And within the latter, Michael Pratt et al. have identified three distinct orientations (which are not mutually exclusive):</p>
<ol>
<li>A craftsmanship orientation that is focused on doing the work well for its own sake. Workers with a craftsmanship orientation typically care most about gaining expertise, often emphasize the aesthetic aspects of the work product, and might have a goal of becoming a master practitioner.</li>
<li>A serving orientation that is focused on doing good for the sake of other people. Workers with a serving orientation typically care most about the beneficiaries of their work and derive satisfaction from helping people.</li>
<li>A team orientation that is focused on doing the work with one's teammates. Workers with a kinship orientation typically find value in opportunities for building close, family-like bonds with their colleagues.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus it strikes me that just about every line of work can afford opportunities for learning, reflection, self-improvement, and fulfillment. It's more a question of how you approach the work than what the work is in itself.</p>

<h2><a href="1782.html">Ways of Life</a></h2>
<h3>2023-05-17</h3>
<p>Having last week explored what philosophers do, I thought I'd broaden that theme by looking at ways of life in general, not only philosophy as a way of life.</p>
<p>Although Aristotle delineated four ways of life (making money, having fun, public service, and intellectual inquiry), nowadays we often think of various hobbies and pursuits as something approaching a way of life. Often these are bound up with one's profession or career (the unfortunately ubiquitous question "what do you do?"), but just as often they are associated with some other focal activity that is a relatively core part of your identity: runner, foodie, crafter, or what have you.</p>
<p>This kind of lifeway can have a significant effect on how you spend your time and structure your day, what you think about and pay attention to, your habits of mind and emotion, how you react to events, the relationships you cultivate, and so on. For instance, a runner traveling to another city might pack her running gear, plan runs while staying there, perhaps meet up with a local running partner or group, etc. By contrast, a foodie traveling to the same location might check out intriguing restaurants, fresh food markets, cooking classes, and the like.</p>
<p>Because there are only so many hours in the day, there are limits to how many ways of life you can pursue in a serious manner at any one stage of life - I'd say less than five and perhaps only two or three. During my 25-year career in the tech industry, I found that I had time and attention primarily for my work and secondarily for some philosophical research and writing, but not also for musical projects.</p>
<p>Yet even that might have been stretching it. Consider a person who is not only passionate about a particular pursuit, but who borders on obsessive (although perhaps in a good way). To take a well-known example, consider J.S. Bach: he was constantly immersed in music, whether playing, teaching, composing, organizing concerts, consulting with musical instrument makers, and so on. Even his close friends, his extended family members, and his two wives (first Maria Barbara and then Anna Magdelena) were musicians! Music was such a thoroughgoing way of life for him that it truly <em>was</em> his life.</p>
<p>Is that level of lifelong commitment necessary to find fulfillment? For some people it is (indeed, in the <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite> Aristotle claimed that it is the height of folly not to have a single, overarching purpose in life). Yet others are just as happy structuring their lives into a few distinct stages (à la the Hindu ashramas) or going with the flow of life in an even looser fashion and following new interests as they arise. It seems to me that deciding which of these approaches makes sense for you is a large part of what it means to know thyself, as the ancient Greeks counseled.</p>

<h2><a href="1781.html">Open Reading Interview</a></h2>
<h3>2023-05-11</h3>
<p>Three weeks ago I had the honor of being interviewed by Sal Inglima of Boston Free Radio for his Open Readings show. We had a great time talking about the fine art of poetry translation. Sal read aloud my translation of a German poem about the eve of World War II by philosopher Walter Kaufmann and I read my translation of Sappho fragment 16 as well as two of my own poems: Ancient Fire (from the eponymous collection) and Brief Wisdom (from <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite>, my book about Friedrich Nietzsche). Enjoy!</p>

<h2><a href="1780.html">What Philosophers Do</a></h2>
<h3>2023-05-11</h3>
<p>If philosophy is a way of life, then what are the characteristic activities of philosophers? (I mean, of course, not professors of philosophy, but people who love and practice the minerval arts of wisdom.)</p>
<p>As far as I know, there is surprisingly little written on this topic, even by Pierre Hadot, who resurrected the ancient conception of philosophy as a way of life about 40 years ago. Sure, Socrates harangued his fellow Athenians in the agora, Confucius traveled around the fragmented states of ancient China encouraging various kings and princes to rule benevolently, the Buddha found enlightenment while mediating under the bodhi tree, Thoreau built a little house by the shores of Walden Pond and rambled around the Concord countryside, Spinoza got excommunicated for heretical thinking and ground lenses for a living, and so on.</p>
<p>Even right there we have quite the diversity in ways of life. As to more theoretical or academic activities, many philosophers wrote down their thoughts for future generations, but others, such as Socrates and Epictetus, wrote not a word. Some, like Plato, started a school where they gathered students and disciples; some, like Epicurus, formed intentional communities; but others, like Nietzsche and Spinoza, lived in relative solitude. Some, like Chu Hsi, were bookish scholars; others were more interested in directly fronting the essential facts of life, as Thoreau put it.</p>
<p>Yet underneath it all, I see this: a philosopher engages in deep and serious reflection about being human, and uses those reflections as the firm foundation for living deliberately and doing consistently what is beautifully right. Indeed, a philosopher takes life and wisdom so seriously that he or she holds as an ideal a lifetime of striving to become a great human being and a noble sage.</p>
<p>These formulations contain many concepts that are quite rarified, admittedly aspirational, and even untimely: reflection, deliberation, depth, seriousness, wisdom, beauty, rightness, greatness, humanity, nobility, sagehood. That strikes me as unavoidable, for, as Spinoza observed, all things excellent are as difficult as they are rare.</p>
<p>If this be idealism, make the most of it.</p>
