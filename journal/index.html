<h2><a href="1971.html">Reflective Passion</a></h2>
<h3>2025-06-15</h3>
<p>In §32 of Walter Kaufmann's 1958 book <cite>Critique of Religion and Philosophy</cite> can be found this magnificent paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>The aspiration for truth and the love of philosophy can represent escapes into remote abstractions or into the study of the thoughts of others about the thoughts of others. In its inception, however, philosophy is a way of life and, as the Greek word suggests, a kind of love and devotion. It is the life of reflective passion - penetrating experience, unimpeded by accepted formulas, thought about. That was what philosophy meant to Socrates, and if we want to bring philosophy down to earth again, it can mean nothing less than that to us.</blockquote>
<p>Although all-too-often this conception of philosophy has been drowned out by various forms of scholasticism, scientism, historicism, et al., it has always resurfaced eventually among thinkers as diverse as Pyrrho, Montaigne, Spinoza, Thoreau, Nietzsche, Jan Patočka, and Kaufmann himself. In my own small way it is an ideal to which I, too, aspire.</p>

<h2><a href="1970.html">Up and Down</a></h2>
<h3>2025-06-13</h3>
<p>About 2500 year ago, Heraclitus said: "the way upward and the way downward are one and the same" (Fragment 60). As always with the enigmatic and evocative fragments of Heraclitus - I've written before about his statement that "you can't step into the same river twice" - there are multiple interpretations of this one, from the mundane (the road up a mountain is the same as the road down a mountain) to the mystical (humanity's way up to god is the same as god's way down to humanity). For today I'd like to link this saying to the Aristotelian theme of practical wisdom (φρόνησις).</p>
<p>Ancient philosophy scholars are fond of talking about the "practical syllogism" - i.e., the few times that Aristotle lays out a semi-formal reasoning process leading to a decision and subsequent action (to choose a trivial example, "I'm hungry", "This apple is edible", "I'll eat this apple"). As David Wiggins says in one of his papers on weakness of the will: "Aristotle calls such patterns of reasoning "syllogisms" because of an analogy that interests him between <em>deductively concluding or asserting</em> and <em>coming to a practical conclusion or acting</em>."</p>
<p>Typically this analogy is held to proceed in a downward direction: the "real" kind of syllogism is abstract or theoretical (as in formal logic) and the "practical" syllogism is a pale imitation of the original. Yet, looking at things from the bottom up, I suggest that the formalisms of logic in fact derive from the everyday reality of action-oriented deliberation, not the other way around.</p>
<p>I see are several reasons for leaning in that direction. First, the English word 'syllogism' is merely a transliteration of the Greek word συλλογισμός, which means "thinking things together" - i.e., reasoning plain and simple, not necessarily the kind of reasoning one experiences in logic, science, or mathematics. Second, deliberation was central to human existence long before Aristotle invented formal logic, so it stands to reason that the former served as a model for the latter: formalizations are dependent on that which they formalize. Third, we engage in everyday reasoning much more frequently than logical reasoning: our lives and activities are literally suffused with thinking, whether we're talking about the work we do, the relationships we nurture, the crafts we learn, the places we go, the foods we cook and eat - the list is endless.</p>
<p>Naturally, if the way upward and the way downward truly are one and the same, then in fact there is only one form of reasoning, which manifests itself in somewhat different ways depending on the context, the objects we're thinking about, the level of formalization and detail involved, the intended outcome, the emotional resonance of the matter at hand, etc. This is why, for instance, Aristotle argued that wisdom (φρόνησις) and statecraft (πολιτική) are the same thing but "differ in being" (i.e., making wise decisions differs from providing leadership even though the two activities involve the same skills). Just as the ancients proposed the unity of virtue (whereby all forms of character-thriving are interconnected), there is, I suspect, something like a unity of thinking in human experience.</p>

<h2><a href="1969.html">Learning Excellence</a></h2>
<h3>2025-06-10</h3>
<p>In my post about Alasdair MacIntyre the other day, I expressed admiration for his recognition that we need to learn the principles of action from the practices life. Here is a quote on the topic from his last essay:</p>
<blockquote>We need to begin again and to do so by returning to the social context in which we learned the use of good and its cognates. What we first had to learn was how to make the distinctions between what we desire and the choiceworthy, and between what pleases those others whom we desire to please and the choiceworthy. We characteristically and generally learn — or fail to learn — to make these distinctions, as we emerge through and from the family into the life of a variety of practices: such practices as those of housework and farmwork, of learning Latin and geometry, of building houses and making furniture, of playing soccer and playing in string quartets. What we can learn only in and through such practices is what the standards of excellence are in each type of activity and how our desires and feelings must be disciplined and transformed and our choices guided by the standards of excellence in each type of activity if we are to achieve such excellence and through it the goods internal to each type of practice.</blockquote>
<p>I might add that what we learn through these practices and activities is first and foremost that <em>there is such a thing as excellence</em>. As Aristotle put it at the very beginning of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>: "Every craft and every inquiry, and similarly every action and commitment, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things aim."</p>
<p>It was Socrates whom Aristotle followed in frequently asking not only "what is this thing?" (e.g., in Plato's <cite>Republic</cite> "what is justice?") but also "does this thing exist?" The latter question is more fundamental, because if a thing is nonexistent (say, unicorns or centaurs) then it doesn't make sense to puzzle over its nature and identity. But once we have the experience of excellence - say, witnessing athletic excellence at the ancient Olympic games or dramatic excellence at the Athnenian Great Dionysia - then we can start to talk about it, think about it, give an account of it, define its standards, compare examples of it, seek commonalities in excellence across different forms of craft and inquiry, and so on.</p>
<p>Moreover, I would posit that the best way to learn excellence is from the inside. As we say nowadays, "life is not a spectator sport" - and neither is excellence. To take a personal example: while it's true that I'll never be nearly as great a guitar player as my musical heroes (such as Julian Bream, Steve Howe, and Michael Hedges), it's also true that I have gained a stronger grasp of excellent playing by striving to improve my guitar skills, in part by attempting to emulate their excellence. The same principle applies in the visual arts (which is why at museums you sometimes see students painting works by the Old Masters), dance, tennis, woodworking, the experimental sciences, medicine, law, warfighting, etc. The basic rule is that one's knowledge becomes stronger to the extent that it is <em>embodied</em> and thus turned into a kind of second nature.</p>
<p>All of this takes time, for life is a process of ripening. This is one reason why philosophical reflection and instruction is somewhat wasted on the young. It is said that at Plato's Academy, students of philosophy could not begin the curriculum until they were forty years of age (and even then they had to start off with years of mathematics) - before that, they simply didn't have enough experience of life to make it worthwhile. MacIntyre echoed this sentiment in his focus on learning principles from practices. Thoreau said something similar in <cite>Walden</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>The student who secures his coveted leisure and retirement by systematically shirking any labor necessary to man obtains but an ignoble and unprofitable leisure, defrauding himself of the experience which alone can make leisure fruitful. "But," says one, "you do not mean that the students should go to work with their hands instead of their heads?" I do not mean that exactly, but I mean something which he might think a good deal like that; I mean that they should not play life, or study it merely, while the community supports them at this expensive game, but earnestly live it from beginning to end. How could youths better learn to live than by at once trying the experiment of living? Methinks this would exercise their minds as much as mathematics.</blockquote>

<h2><a href="1968.html">Living on the Margins</a></h2>
<h3>2025-06-08</h3>
<p>While reading today the final essay published by Alasdair MacIntyre, I was struck by the following two passages:</p>
<blockquote>[J]ust as Aristotelian moral and political theory provides us with resources for interpreting and redirecting our practical lives, so too our practical experience provides us with reasons for criticizing and sometimes rejecting some of Aristotle’s own concepts, theses, and arguments. We learn to identify that in Aristotle which derives from the limitations and prejudices of Athenian and Macedonian elites. So we develop Aristotle beyond Aristotle and in so doing may find — as I found — that our Aristotelianism has had to become that of Aquinas.</blockquote>
<p>and:</p>
<blockquote>Two salient thoughts emerge from this narrative. The first concerns the importance for the moral philosopher of living on the margins, intellectually as well as politically, a necessary condition for being able to see things as they are. The two standpoints without which I would have been unable to understand either modern morality or twentieth-century moral philosophy are those of Thomism and of Marxism....</blockquote>
<p>I agree that most of (what we perceive as) Aristotle's faults derive from the "limitations and prejudices of Athenian and Macedonian elites" - or, more broadly, from the significant differences betweeen classical Greece and the 21st-century Anglosphere, as well as the simple passage of time and advancement of science and history since then. Yet I find it curious to focus on the motes in the eyes of the ancient elites rather than the beams in the eyes of current elites. To my mind, two of those modern beams are Christianity and Marxism, the very foundations of MacIntyre's outsider perspective!</p>
<p>As previously noted, I plan to revisit MacIntyre's work in the years ahead, so I don't want to pre-judge what I might find there. However, I have to wonder if there might be more constructive "margins" from which to gain a clearer sense of the way things are today; aside from Aristotelianism itself, there certainly are plenty of vantage points to choose from, such as Buddhism and Pyrrhonism in philosophy, classical liberalism in political economy, and numerous strands of research in psychology such as evolutionary psychology, ecological psychology, and humanistic psychology.</p>
<p>More positively, I should add that I perceive much to like in this last essay of MacIntyre's, especially his dual emphases on learning principles of action from the practices of one's life and on looking at the problems of living from outside of academic or theoretic philosophy. I'll have more to say about both topics in the near future.</p>

<h2><a href="1967.html">Utopia Is Not an Option</a></h2>
<h3>2025-06-02</h3>
<p>The recent death of philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre has prompted numerous assessments of his work (which, I'll admit, I have not looked at in decades - an oversight that I plan to remedy soon because of his status as perhaps the most prominent neo-Aristotelian thinker of the last fifty years). Several of the remembrances I've read expressed frustration with the lack of specificity in MacIntyre's political philosophy, which boils down to what my college professor Charles Larmore called "polis envy": the desire to construct communities on the model of the ancient Greek city-states, in which all the citizens worked together for the sake of a common purpose and a common vision of the good life. Only in such a setting, says MacIntyre, can human beings lead an ethically flourishing life.</p>
<p>This line of thinking strikes me as somewhat utopian, at least if people attempt to translate it into a consistent political program - as perhaps some of the "National Conservatives" have tried to do. Although years ago I went through a utopian or meta-utopian phase of my own, these days I'm not convinced. Yes, there is plenty to fix in our political, economic, and societal arrangements; even more significantly, as Thomas W. Smith points out in his book <cite>Revaluing Ethics</cite>, <em>every</em> society deforms the human person in one way or another so there is always room for improvement. Yet it seems to me that one can live an examined, ethically thriving life in any reasonably free society, because such a society provides sufficient affordances for work, love, family, friendship, community involvement, artistic creation, scientific research, lifelong learning, personal reflection, religious contemplation, philosophical speculation, and all the other worthy activities of life. We don't need a utopia to make that possible, which is a good thing because, as I like to say, utopia is not an option.</p>
<p>However, if people don't attempt to translate this line of thinking into a political program, then we'll end up with small intentional groupings along the lines of the ancient philosophical communities or the medieval monasteries (MacIntyre's book <cite>After Virtue</cite> ends with a call for a new St. Benedict). Indeed, inspired in some instances by MacIntyre, a number of such groups have formed over the last quarter century, loosely gathered under the heading of the New Monasticism. I plan to do also some reading on this topic in the coming months, with special attention to the potential for resurrecting at least some of the ancient spirit of philosophy as a way of life.</p>

<h2><a href="1966.html">Universe and Humanverse</a></h2>
<h3>2025-05-30</h3>
<p>As I have continued to read Spinoza's <cite>Ethics</cite> and at the same time apply Walter Kaufmann's suggestion to rethink every step critically, for a few days there I started to take notes toward a geometrical presentation of propositions I could agree with (e.g., instead beginning with a self-caused God who created the universe, my propositions began on more Aristotelian lines with being itself and an eternal universe).</p>
<p>Even though this might have been a worthwhile exercise (and I might revisit it sometime), doubts crept in. Is the fundamental nature of the universe really the right place to start in constructing a philosophy of life? Channeling thinkers as diverse as Socrates, Lao Tzu, Lin Yutang, Pierre Hadot, and Robert Sokolowski, I had a flash of insight: the ground truth to build from is not the universe as a whole but the "humanverse" in which we find ourselves. By this I mean specifically that <em>you and I are both human beings who possess λόγος and therefore can engage in a conversation about truth, beauty, meaning, and how to live</em>.</p>
<p>This conversation is not only philosophical: as I sketched out in my manifesto on philokalia earlier this year, it is also musical, poetical, artistic, and aesthetic in the widest sense of the word. (Or, to put it another way, philosophy is not only linguistic, dialectical, and theoretical.)</p>
<p>In Plato's <cite>Phaedrus</cite>, Socrates worried about the impact of the written word on human interaction because you can't have a conversation with a book. Machiavelli and Nietzsche (among others) might have disagreed, because in their own minds and in their practice of writing they carried on a kind of conversation with ancient friends such as Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, and Plutarch.</p>
<p>Naturally, ancient friends are no substitute for living friends, which is why philosophy, music, poetry, arts, sciences, crafts, and so many other pursuits are best done in collaboration and communication with people who can help you learn, grow, and flourish.</p>
<p>As to the propositions and commitments that flow from the ground truth of shared humanity, shared thought, and shared speech, I'll need to ponder that further and post again...</p>
