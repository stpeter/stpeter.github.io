<h2><a href="1719.html">That Flourishing Feeling</a></h2>
<h3>2022-06-16</h3>
<p>Positive psychology is sometimes perceived as putting a premium on pleasant experiences - what critics call "happiology". Yet just because pleasure is a positive experience doesn't mean it's the only positive experience!</p>
<p>Yes, it's true that thinkers as ancient as Socrates and Aristotle have maintained that people who flourish also experience greater enjoyment in life. However, it seems to me that the personal experience of eudaimonia is much more intriguing and varied than mere hedonics. Consider Aristotle's claim that the objective conditions of eudaimonia produce subjective experiences of greater tranquility, stability of personal identity, harmony between reason and emotion, lack of significant regrets over one's actions, internal coherence or "being of one mind", evaluations that one's life is valuable and lacks nothing of significance, etc. Modern thinkers have added to this list, as for instance with the late Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's concept of deep engagement in one's activities (see his book <cite>Flow</cite>) and Daniel Haybron's exploration of qualities such as attunement with one's environment and a sense of expansiveness (see his book <cite>The Pursuit of Unhappiness</cite>). Generating a comprehensive description of the feelings of flourishing would be a fascinating research project for someone who is so inclined...</p>

<h2><a href="1718.html">The Soul of Stoicism</a></h2>
<h3>2022-06-09</h3>
<p>People sometimes ask me what I think about Stoicism (not the phenomenon of physical and emotional fortitude, which I would call stoicism with a small "s", but the Greco-Roman philosophical school that has undergone a recent revival). At the risk of alienating those of my readers who lean in the direction of Stoicism, I've decided to write a few blog posts on the topic, starting with this one.</p>
<p>Although I have benefited from reading and reflecting on the likes of Epictetus, Seneca, Musonius Rufus, Marcus Aurelius, and recent authors like William Irvine (<cite>A Guide to the Good Life</cite>) and Pierre Hadot (<cite>The Inner Citadel</cite>), there are aspects of Stoicism that simply don't resonate with me. One of these is the rather elemental matter of Stoic views about the human person. This is a large topic and I try to keep my blog posts short, so what follows is a mere overview of my thoughts.</p>
<p>As I see it, Stoic philosophy encourages a somewhat disintegrated description and experience of what it is to be a human being. It does this by strongly separating the soul from the body; according to the Stoics, the true foundation of personhood is the soul, whereas the body is a mere material substrate. Indeed, Marcus Aurelius quotes Epictetus as saying "Thou art a little soul bearing about a corpse." I, however, prefer a more integrated or fundamentally Aristotelian viewpoint, in which all aspects of the person cohere and accord.</p>
<p>To expand: in his <cite>Meditations</cite>, Marcus Aurelius emphasizes the importance of understanding each thing in its essence (Chapter III, Section 11 - using the rendering from Pierre Hadot's excellent book <cite>The Inner Citadel</cite> as translated by Michael Chase):</p>
<blockquote>One must always make a definition or description of the object which is presented in a representation, so as to see it in itself, as it is in its essence, in its nakedness, in its totality, in all its details. One must say to oneself the name which is peculiar to it, as well as the names of the parts which compose it, and into which it will be resolved.</blockquote>
<p>He later provides several examples of this approach to definition (Chapter VI, Section 13):</p>
<blockquote>How important it is to represent to oneself, when it comes to fancy dishes and other such foods: "This is the corpse of a fish, this other thing the corpse of a bird or a pig." Similarly, "This Falernian wine is just some grape juice," and "This purple vestment is some sheep's hair moistened in the blood of some shellfish." When it comes to sexual union, we must say, "This is the rubbing together of abdomens, accompanied by the spasmodic ejaculation of a sticky liquid." How important are these representations which reach the thing itself and penetrate right through it, so that one can see what it is in reality.</blockquote>
<p>As I see it, Marcus simply misses the appropriate level of description here. It's as if he said that food consists of molecules, therefore a bowl of mud should be just as nutritious as a bowl of stew. To assert that the essence of your friend or spouse or child is their flesh and bones - their mere matter - misses everything that truly matters about human relationships and the many affordances of social interactions. Furthermore, the Stoics apply the same logic to your relationship with yourself: "in reality" you are just blood and guts, but the soul can rise above its disgusting origins by turning against the body and anything that involves the body (the physical sensation of holding a loved one, the quickening pulse you feel when you're excited about seeing a long-lost friend, etc.).</p>
<p>To my mind, this line of thinking sets up an unhealthy dynamic of self-denial and even a kind of internal dis-integration. We humans are embodied creatures and our real-life experience is so intimately integrated that we would never be aware of a deep-seated opposition between our bodily, mental, emotional, and psychological aspects unless some big idea person dreamed it up.</p>
<p>I'd like to reiterate that I don't condemn the entire philosophy of Stoicism and that I have found value in several aspects of Stoicism. I'll describe these more fully in a future post...</p>

<h2><a href="1717.html">Being an Integrity</a></h2>
<h3>2022-05-27</h3>
<p>Yesterday while reading an old book on East Asian folk crafts (<cite>The Unknown Crafstman</cite> by S≈çetsu Yanagi, p. 153), I came across the following passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I am asked for a Buddhist explanation of the perception of beauty, my answer is a simple one: "One must discard one's self". But of course the process is not easily accomplished; grasping the reality of beauty is no easier. In looking at objects, a man makes use of his intelligence; he evaluates on the basis of his own conceptions, he passes judgement on the basis of his own experience. In so doing, "I" become the master pronouncing on the "object", which I regard as my guest. Since one's self does not disappear in this process, "I" and "it" remain two different entities; no union between the two occurs.</p>
<p>The lingering on of the self may be likened to looking through coloured spectacles: one is gazing at objects through the colour called ego and therefore one cannot see them as they are, one can only see them enveloped in something else. Often a man, in attempting to see things, makes use of some form of measurement, its degrees marked in accordance with his own intellect; with it he tries to appraise everything quantitatively. But many things do not permit of such treatment, so as a result he sees only those parts that do. Whenever fixed rules are applied to an object, only certain parts of it may be perceived. But an object is an integrity; when, therefore, we force dualistic distinctions upon it, its reality has already fled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This thought is fascinating: "an object is an integrity". Or, as we might say more naturally in English, "an integrated whole" (I have never seen "integrity" used as a noun, but I like it!). Although Yanagi was talking about pottery and other folk crafts, the idea applies even more deeply to living things and especially human beings. Indeed, it's not all that different from Aristotle's suggestion that "a loved one is another self", for love involves recognition that the person you care for is an independent and integrated and beautiful whole. This of course implies that you, too, are "an integrity" and that you deserve to treat yourself as such and in turn deserve to be treated as such by others in a flourishing community of mutual respect and benevolence.</p>

<h2><a href="1716.html">Isms and Wisdom</a></h2>
<h3>2022-05-19</h3>
<p>Which came first, the ism or the wisdom?</p>
<p>The answer is clear: there were wise people for at least tens of thousands of years before philosophical isms were invented around the sixth century BCE by the likes of Thales, Confucius, and Siddhartha Gautama. As Pierre Hadot rediscovered through his historical research into philosophy as a way of life, in ancient Greece theoretical philosophy grew out of and was secondary to the "spiritual exercises" of practical philosophy. Thus, for instance, a wise person might act stoically but that doesn't mean Stoicism makes you a wise person. The same is true for the signature virtues of Epicureanism, Christianity, Taoism, Buddhism, and all the rest.</p>
<p>One thing that an ism gives you is a credo: an easy way to separate those in your group from those outside your group. Thus, for instance, in Christianity the Nicene Creed became a convenient way to determine if you were dealing with a heretic (say, a gnostic) rather than an orthodox believer. And, as far as I've been able to determine, the gnostics were more focused on gaining wisdom than on gaining adherents (see <cite>The Gnostic Gospels</cite> by Elaine Pagels).</p>
<p>The worry one hears from adherents of a particular ism is that if you borrow insights from other schools of thought then you're stooping to mere eclecticism (which isn't an ism in the same sense as Stoicism or Buddhism or whatever). I used to share that worry too, but then I realized what really matters is to be a successful human being, not a dedicated follower of an existing creed.</p>

<h2><a href="1715.html">Big Idea People</a></h2>
<h3>2022-05-12</h3>
<p>When we think of philosophy, we tend to think of theoretical philosophy: cloistered academics, armchair thinkers, and dreamy contemplatives arguing over the fine points of abstruse topics that have little if any practical import. This reputation is, unfortunately, well-deserved, especially in recent times. Yet if we accept the validity of philosophy as a way of life, then these "big idea people" fall short of the ideal. There's a significant difference between the love of ideas for their own sake and the love of wisdom for the sake of livng well. I'm not saying you can't combine the two, but the second is more valuable than the first because it is the foundation not just for intellectual fascination but for human flourishing. I discussed related matters in a talk I gave at the University of Colorado a few years ago, entitled "You're Majoring in What?!? Why Philosophy is a Foundation for Success"...</p>

<h2><a href="1714.html">Live Long and Prosper</a></h2>
<h3>2022-05-05</h3>
<p>Recently I came across a study entitled "Longevity increased by positive self-perceptions of aging" (Levy et al. 2002 - apparently Becca Levy has a new book out entitled <cite>Breaking the Age Code</cite>, which I have not read yet). The abstract states: "This research found that older individuals with more positive self-perceptions of aging, measured up to 23 years earlier, lived 7.5 years longer than those with less positive self-perceptions of aging. This advantage remained after age, gender, socioeconomic status, loneliness, and functional health were included as covariates." As Spock would say: fascinating!</p>
<p>Because America is such a youth-oriented (perhaps even youth-obsessed) society, we tend to have negative perceptions of older people and of aging in general. Yet aging is part of living, and a truly biocentric philosophy should do justice to the full span of life. To be sure, there are things one might not eagerly look forward to (health issues, losing loved ones, etc.), just as there are things one might not fondly look back on from one's early life (bad decisions, foolish actions, etc.). But on balance there are many positive opportunities for flourishing and prospering as one gets older: opportunities to engage in lifelong learning, to master new skills, to pursue a long-delayed avocation, to complete passion projects, to deepen one's relationships, to become a grandparent, to travel, to tend one's garden literally or figuratively, to impart knowledge to younger generations, to reap the compounding effects of wisdom, and so on. The last of these is especially relevant to philosophy as a way of life, because there's no inherent limit to the acquisition and practice of wisdom.</p>
<p>Live long and prosper, indeed!</p>
