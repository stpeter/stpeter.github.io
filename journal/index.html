<h2><a href="1766.html">Best Friend Books</a></h2>
<h3>2023-02-12</h3>
<p>It occurs to me that, just as we have circles of friendship, so also we sometimes have circles of influence and affection in the books we read. Certain books and authors are like best friends that we revisit again and again: think of those who cherish the novels of Jane Austen, the <cite>Meditations</cite> of Marcus Aurelius, the <cite>Confessions</cite> of Augustine, or the plays of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Moreover, just as friends come and go through the course of life, so too with books. When I was a teenager I read <cite>The Fountainhead</cite> eight or nine times, which led eventually to my writing <cite>The Tao of Roark</cite>; but we simply haven't kept in touch over the years and its place in my inner circle has been filled by others.</p>
<p>At this point I'd say that my "best friend books" are Aristotle's <cite>Ethics</cite>, the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite>, Thoreau's <cite>Walden</cite>, and the poems of Emily Dickinson. Yet in the coming years I plan to spend much more time with Shakespeare, Montaigne, George Eliot, Jane Austen, and George Santayana, so the list might change.</p>
<p>Which books and authors are some of your best friends?</p>

<h2><a href="1765.html">Career Reflections</a></h2>
<h3>2023-02-09</h3>
<p>Twelve months ago this week I quit my job at Mozilla. Herewith a few reflections on my 25 years in tech.</p>
<p>When in my senior year of college I decided that I would not apply to Ph.D. programs in ancient philosophy, I had very little idea about what I would do in the real world. I started out in corporate training for several years and then got hooked on the early Internet (circa 1995). Those were the heady days before Big Tech, when everything seemed possible. At my first few tech jobs we got paid a decent salary but not the ridiculous sums doled out to tech workers nowadays - that kind of funny money didn't become common until five or ten years ago. Clearly, however, through a program of aggressive savings I did well enough financially because I was able to leave the tech industry in my mid-50s and thus pursue a more contemplative existence later in life.</p>
<p>Seeing and experiencing the relentless centralization - I might even say corruption - of the Internet has been disheartening. In my work on Jabber and many other technologies, I strove to build things that protected personal autonomy and preserved the decentralized foundations of the Internet. Yet all too often, tech companies big and small care about neither of those principles, as I discovered up close while working on the privacy technologies we made at Mozilla to safeguard Firefox users from ubiquitous tracking. It saddens me that a transformational technology that began with such promise and idealism has devolved into a machine for surveillance and manipulation. Indeed, to my mind it's a legitimate question whether, on balance, the Internet has been good for humanity. Ponder that a while and see what you conclude.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, I cherish the opportunities I had to work with hundreds of great colleagues. Even in the toxic companies I had the misfortune to encounter, I made wonderful friends and learned so much about people, teamwork, and organizations. I'm now endeavoring to "give back" by incorporating many of the lessons I learned into the training seminar that my wife Elisa and I are developing for managers, team leaders, and team members.</p>

<h2><a href="1764.html">Aristotle on AI</a></h2>
<h3>2023-02-02</h3>
<p>Apparently the world is all agog over a computer program called ChatGPT. It's a harbinger of yet another emergency disaster crisis! The singularity is near! We're facing an imminent reality collapse! We won't be able to tell fake from real, machine from human, false from true! How will we know what information to trust?!?</p>
<p>Well, we might try some of same methods we've used at least since Aristotle wrote the <cite>Rhetoric</cite> about 2400 years ago, and likely since time immemorial. There are two key questions: (1) do you trust the speaker? and (2) are you persuaded by the speaker's argument? (Or as Arnold Kling puts it: "we decide what to believe by deciding who to believe".)</p>
<p>As to the first question, at line 1378a8 of the <cite>Rhetoric</cite> Aristotle identifies three primary characteristics that lead us to trust a speaker: the person's φρόνησις (wisdom, good judgment, intelligence), εὐνοία (benevolence, goodwill, friendly feeling), and ἀρετή (excellence, virtue, integrity).</p>
<p>Yes, I know, computer programs don't exercise wisdom or good judgment, they don't experience feelings of benevolence (or anything else), and they don't develop character traits. That pretty much answers the first question, eh?</p>
<p>The second question is slightly more knotty, but let's recognize that it comes second for a reason. If you "consume" some arbitrary "content" over the Internet, there's no guarantee that it was made by a human being (except to the extent that the programmers were human, although ChatGPT can produce passable software code so it's unclear how long that will last). ChatGPT and its successors will simply make it even less likely that there was a human directly involved.</p>
<p>It strikes to me that there are several primary mitigations here. First, consume less arbitrary content from the Internet. Second, focus on essentials instead of ephemera (as Thoreau said: "Read Not the Times; Read the Eternities"). Third, read and watch and listen to people you trust: people who have the wisdom, integrity, and self-respect not to publish AI-generated content. Fourth and most important, spend your time interacting - preferably in person - with people you know: family, friends, neighbors, colleagues, and everyone else in your circles of friendship.</p>
<p>Perhaps Socrates was more prescient than he knew when he distrusted the written word because you can't have a conversation with it...</p>

<h2><a href="1763.html">The Emergency Disaster Crisis</a></h2>
<h3>2023-01-27</h3>
<p>One reason I don't pay much attention to the news is that just about everything being reported on is an emergency, a disaster, a crisis! I like to run them all together and say that we're in the midst of an <em>Emergency Disaster Crisis</em>.</p>
<p>Naturally, what you consider part of the Emergency Disaster Crisis is a matter of personal disposition and ideological affinity: climate, inflation, COVID-19, crime, immigration, censorship, education, populism, elitism, racism, sexism, Big Tech, Big Government, housing, homelessness, poverty, drugs, religion, war, the singularity, and so on ad infinitum. However, it seems that almost everyone agrees on one thing: the sky is falling!</p>
<p>This kind of sensationalism grabs our attention because we humans are hardwired to worry about imminent danger, but it ignores the boring truth that most of human history has been devoted to the fine art of muddling through.</p>
<p>Ayn Rand once said "Don't bother to examine a folly - ask yourself only what it accomplishes." As far as I can see, the folly of the Emergency Disaster Crisis accomplishes several things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It keeps most people in a state of constant anxiety.</li>
  <li>Those people are more likely to embrace extreme proposals.</li>
  <li>Rampant extremism ensures that people are constantly fighting each other.</li>
  <li>This, in turn, prevents people from looking into true causes and reasonable solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cynic in me says that this is all very convenient for those in power. The philosopher in me observes that the more I avoid belief in the Emergency Disaster Crisis, the more likely it is that I can achieve intellectual moderation and emotional equilibrium. And, much as I wish I could change the world, at least I can try to change myself.</p>

<h2><a href="1762.html">Circles of Friendship</a></h2>
<h3>2023-01-25</h3>
<p>As noted last week, Robin Dunbar, who has done amazing research into close personal relationships, is best known for "Dunbar's Number" - his finding that the typical friends network contains about 150 people (as discussed in a recent post by Arnold Kling). Yet as I also noted long ago in my blog post "Joining the Band", there are actually multiple Dunbar numbers, each roughly 3x more or less than the next one in the series.</p>
<p>Thus above the 150 mark one finds circles of ~500 acquaintances, ~1500 people whose names you know, and ~5000 people whose faces you recognize. Below the 150 mark one finds circles of ~50 good friends, ~15 best friends (which Dunbar also calls a "support clique"), ~5 close friends (a "sympathy group"), and ~1.5 intimates. (Why 1.5? Men typically have only their spouse in their intimates group, whereas women often have a spouse and a female BFF.)</p>
<p>The smaller the group, the greater the frequency of contact (phone calls, lunches, shared activities, etc.), the greater the emotional closeness and feeling of mutual understanding, and the greater the willingness to help each other.</p>
<p>Why are some people closer to the center of your circles of friendship, and others out toward the periphery? That's where the seven pillars of friendship come in: the more of the pillars you have in common with someone (e.g., similar worldview AND grew up in the same location AND similar sense of humor), the more likely they are to be closer to the center.</p>
<p>Personally I found these insights to shed light on my family relations and friendships, but they have implications for the working world, too. For instance, the makers of GoreTex insist on limiting the size of their factories to 150 people. Startup companies typically go through inflection points as they pass certain milestones (e.g., with more than ~15 people you need more policies and procedures). Teams become ineffective if they have too many people in them (in my experience, much more than 5 is too many). And so on.</p>
<p>Dunbar's 2021 book <cite>Friends</cite> thoroughly summarizes his research, and I highly recommend it if you're curious to learn more.</p>

<h2><a href="1761.html">Metaphysics in Verse II</a></h2>
<h3>2023-01-23</h3>
<p>Among the strangest conceptions of metaphysics is Aristotle's fanciful (or perhaps deadly serious) hypothesis of the Unmoved Mover. It's difficult to understand quite what he was getting at, and I'm not about to formulate a scholarly exegesis of the idea. But I did compose a little poem about it:</p>
<blockquote>
Had I a god, I’m sure it’d be<br>
The sum of all felicity,<br>
Which joys in pure activity -<br>
<br>
Whose every action is a thought,<br>
Whose every insight is what’s sought,<br>
Who ever does just what it ought.<br>
<br>
This god all things would emulate:<br>
Not serve, but strive to re-create<br>
Within the limits of their state.<br>
<br>
What this would mean for humankind<br>
Is not that we would leave behind<br>
What’s animal, but honor mind.
