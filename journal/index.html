<h2><a href="2005.html">Eleven Questions</a></h2>
<h3>2025-11-28</h3>
<p>Apparently Substack has something called the Sunshine Blogger Awards, wherein writers are tagged to answer eleven questions of the tagger's choosing. Although I haven't been tagged, reading a few such posts set me to thinking, so here are eleven fascinating questions to ponder, along with my own answers.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Q: If could live for a few hundred years, what other culture or cultures would you immerse yourself in, and why?</strong></p>
    <p>A: I'd be curious to to learn Japanese, read and write haiku in their language of origin, study Japanese calligraphy, master the biwa or the koto, become a Zen monk for a while, wander the Japanese islands, and immerse myself in Japanese society. It's a truism that Japanese culture is very different from other world cultures, and I would try to understand why from as close to the inside as I could get.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Q: If you could travel back in time to solve a certain historical mystery or prevent a certain historical event, which would it be, and why?</strong></p>
    <p>A: I'd travel to Elizabethan England and sleuth around to determine if someone other than William Shaksper of Stratford-upon-Avon wrote the works of William Shake-speare. Francis Bacon? Edward de Vere? Whodunit?? This topic intrigues me because knowing more about the author would help us better understand the amazing plays and poems published under his name. Whether it was the man from Stratford or someone else, I'd want to get to know him (or her??).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Q: If you could bring a past thinker, writer, scientist, or artist into the present to study with, who would it be, and why?</strong></p>
    <p>A: That'd have to be Aristotle. Not only do I have lots of questions for him about soulcraft and philosophy, but I'd love to see how he would adjust his theories to address the evidence of modern science and society. So many people say that Aristotle singlehandedly held back the progress of science for 1500 years, but I believe that the person who founded the sciences of logic and biology would be more open-minded and excited to learn about the modern world. Perhaps I could even smuggle back a lost treatise or two...</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Q: What sacred or special place could inspire you to complete an old-fashioned pilgrimage, and why?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Athens, the center of ancient Greek literature, culture, and philosophy. Even granted that it has changed tremendously over the last 2500 years, it would still be worth a walk of a few hundred miles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Q: What long journey (by car, train, foot, boat, etc.) most intrigues you, and why?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Hiking the Appalachian Trail. It's true that I'm not tremendously fond of camping, but I could get over that in order to experience the magic of the long walk from Georgia to my home state of Maine (or should I take the SOBO route from Maine to Georgia??).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Q: What art form (music, painting, poetry, etc.) do you find most personally meaningful, and why?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Music. It's not easy to explain why one is attracted to particular art-forms, but music has always given me solace and inspiration, both as a listener and as a player. There is something simultaneously visceral and ethereal about music: it goes straight to the heart and nourishes the soul. As Nietzsche once said, "Without music, life would be a mistake."</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Q: What single work of art is most personally meaningful to you, and why?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Bach's Cello Suites. These suites take the listener on an incredible journey and express a fathomless range of human emotions with just the single voice of the most beautiful instrument known to man. I never tire of listening to the Cello Suites, and as a musician I would find them worthy of endless study and contemplation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Q: Which book or books do you find so fascinating that you could re-read them once a year, and why?</strong></p>
    <p>A: My three nominees are the <cite>Essays</cite> of Michel Montaigne, the <cite>Complete Poems</cite> of Emily Dickinson, and the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite>. All three of these books are intellectually stimulating and beautifully, poetically written, containing worlds within worlds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Q: If you could change one thing about human nature or society, what would it be, and why?</strong></p>
    <p>A: The human propensity to violence. In one sense I suppose that humans wouldn't have made it to the top of the evolutionary heap without some violent tendencies, but I wish we could tone it down without losing our competitive edge. So much misery results from man's inhumanity to man.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Q: If you had to adopt a religion or worldview other than your own, which would it be, and why?</strong></p>
    <p>A: I'd probably give several a try (Judaism, Gnosticism, Taoism, etc.) but settle on a kind of non-doctrinaire Buddhism because of its appreciation for the ambiguities and evanescent beauties of life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Q: What does your ideal day look and feel like?</strong></p>
    <p>A: A long walk in the morning; a few hours for playing guitar and composing; cooking up some homemade food; stimulating conversation with my sweetie or a dear friend; listening to good music; sitting by a warm fire; reading deeply from a few great books; that sort of thing. In sum, the kind of day that my Dutch ancestors would call gezellig.</p>

<h2><a href="2004.html">Beauty, Pleasure, Mozart, and Bob Dylan</a></h2>
<h3>2025-11-26</h3>
<p>Since choosing the name Beautiful Wisdom for my Substack earlier this year, I have focused more on wisdom and less on beauty. That might be changing, for several reasons: I've been getting deeper into musical composition, theory, and performance; I've been souring on speculative logorrhea; and in some of my recent readings on aesthetics I've been disappointed with philosophical accounts of beauty.</p>
<p>A case in point regarding the latter is George Santayana's 1896 classic <cite>The Sense of Beauty</cite>. I hasten to mention that I am just getting started with Santayana's vast oeuvre, so I might be misreading him. Unfortunately, right now I find his underlying account of beauty and the arts to be implausible. To wit, Santayana claims that beauty is (aesthetic) pleasure regarded as the quality of a thing: when a person says that an object or experience is beautiful, all they really mean is that it gives them a purely subjective pleasure - which they then shift, with absolutely no justification, onto the object itself and its perceptually salient features (such as color, symmetry, and form). It's almost a kind of aesthetic emotivism; if I say that Michelangelo's David is beautiful, all I really mean is "David Yum!"</p>
<p>If Santayana's account were true, then I could not call something beautiful if I didn't enjoy it, and I could not enjoy something if it weren't beautiful. However, in my experience both of these paradoxical phenomena are not only possible but quite common.</p>
<p>As an example of the first paradox, I recognize that objectively speaking the music of Mozart is quite beautiful: classically balanced, highly melodic, endlessly inventive, and so on. Yet subjectively speaking I concur with Glenn Gould's assessment that most of Mozart's music is so much musical prattle. You might counter that evidently I must be a musical boor: even though I could converse for hours about the wonders of, say, Bach's Cello Suites or Fauré's Nocturnes, I simply <em>should</em> enjoy Mozart. But this aesthetic imperative is even less legitimate than the moral imperatives of Kant or the Stoics.</p>
<p>As an example of the second paradox, I adore the music and, yes, even the singing of Bob Dylan. More evidence of my boorishness! Objectively speaking Dylan's vocal stylings are, at best, an acquired taste; at worst, they are downright grating. Here again you might assert that I simply <em>shouldn't</em> enjoy Dylan's music because it's not beautiful, whereas I again would simply ignore your aesthetic imperatives.</p>
<p>In line with my thoroughgoing particularism, my aesthetic experience is dependent on the individual work at hand, not some hard-and-fast policy that overrides the evidence of my ears and heart. For instance, I'd rather hear Mozart's horn concertos than Dylan's "Idiot Wind" (which to my ear is a decidedly ugly rant set to music).</p>
<p>Where does this leave Santayana? Even though I am not convinced by the foundations of his aesthetic theory, <cite>The Sense of Beauty</cite> contains numerous insights into aesthetic experience, which I am eagerly absorbing as I seek to form my own account of what I'm calling philokalia or the love and practice of beauty.</p>

<h2><a href="2003.html">The Personal Side of Public Behavior</a></h2>
<h3>2025-11-22</h3>
<p>While conversing with a friend the other day about the seemingly endless decline in societal standards of public behavior, I had a realization: there is nothing I can do about how other people conduct themselves; all I can do is conduct myself up to <em>my own</em> standards. This is not a newfound awareness - I can't count the number of times I have observed that the only thing I have control over in life is myself, and even this can be rather tenuous - yet each time I make such an observation my consciousness experiences a little jolt of surprised recognition.</p>
<p>What are the personal standards of public conduct to which I aspire? On reflection, here are few that come to mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Treat every person with dignity. This applies especially to people who work in roles that many folks consider to be purely functional (waitresses, nurses, retail workers, librarians, flight attendants, janitors, customer service representatives, and the like). As an example, many years ago while eating a quick lunch in the Cleveland airport on my way to yet another technology conference, I had a brief conversation with the harried and likely underpaid waitress, making sure to address her by the name on her name tag. She tearfully said it was the first time that any patron had ever used her name!</li>
  <li>Say thanks. Another time while on a flight to some business destination or another, I happened to be sitting in the very back of the plane when I expressed my thanks to the flight attendant for handing me a snack. She in turn thanked me for this minor courtesy and mentioned that no one in the rows ahead of me had said thank you!</li>
  <li>Express empathy. If a person I'm interacting with isn't completely on their game, I try to imagine that perhaps they have recently lost a loved one, are in an abusive relationship, work two jobs, have financial or health problems, or are experiencing something equally difficult. What are my petty troubles compared to theirs?</li>
  <li>Compliment people who deserve it. When someone is especially kind, helpful, polite, elegant, or what have you, I try to compliment them on how they conduct themselves. In a professional context, what's even better is to tell their boss!</li>
</ul>
<p>I describe these principles not to boast about how wonderful I am (I have a long way to go on the path to sagehood!), but to reinforce them in my own mind so that I can live up to them more consistently.</p>

<h2><a href="2002.html">Twenty-Five Years of Blogging</a></h2>
<h3>2025-11-21</h3>
<p>On this day in the year 2000, I posted the first entry in my online journal. Two thousand posts and 650,000+ words later, I'm still at it. Granted, my journal is not quite of Thoreauvian proportions: our friend Henry produced over 2 million words in 24 years of journaling (all of which I read while encountering Thoreau in preparation for composing my book <cite>The Upland Farm</cite>). Even so, I've done a lot of scribbling over the last quarter century!</p>
<p>Here's how I described the nascent endeavor back then:</p>
<blockquote>I see this space as part diary, part sandbox, and part weblog - a place to explore ideas and events on the web, in real life, and in my head. Hopefully someone other than me will find it interesting. :-)</blockquote>
<p>Some things have changed over the last 25 years: for instance, I don't know what makes a "weblog" distinctive now that so much of modern existence has moved from physical to virtual. Moreover, because I'm a pretty private person I have always shied away from treating this journal like a diary. Thus over time I've gravitated mostly to the sandbox model, in which I try ideas on for size and explore the personal implications of my readings and reflections.</p>
<p>To my mind, this journal isn't writing in a professional sense but the simple act of thinking out loud, which I find enormously helpful in pursuit of greater clarity and wisdom as I travel through life. That a few folks seemingly like to listen in on my dialogue with myself means a great deal to me.</p>
<p>Here's to the next 25 years!</p>

<h2><a href="2001.html">Giving and Receiving</a></h2>
<h3>2025-11-16</h3>
<p>Recent life circumstances have spurred me to reflect further on love as an activity, but also on love as a "passivity", as it were.</p>
<p>It strikes me that, at root, the activity of loving consists of freehearted giving, whereas the "passivity" of loving consists of gracious receiving; and, moreover, that there is beautiful nobility in both the giving and the receiving. This nobility is well captured in a poignant scene from Willa Cather's novel <cite>O Pioneers!</cite> (Part II, Chapter XII), wherein our heroine Alexandra has offered financial support to Carl, her childhood friend and intended husband, who replies: "To take what you would give me, I should have to be either a very large man or a very small one, and I am only in the middle class." (In the context, it's clear that Carl is speaking of moral classes, not monetary ones.)</p>
<p>It's noteworthy that the word "take" is used here rather than "receive", for we associate taking with character traits approaching avarice, whereas receiving requires attitudes of thankfulness for the gift and esteem for the giver. This is a significant factor in the nobility of receiving.</p>
<p>As Aristotle emphasizes in his writings on soulcraft, the ideal relationship is deeply reciprocal, characterized by freehearted giving and gracious receiving in both directions. Yet unavoidably there are situations (e.g., illness and convalescence) and times of life (esp. childhood and old age) when one receives more than one gives; philosophers of care and relationships must do justice to these, as for instance many Confucians have done. Furthermore, what's given can be of a different order than what's received; we see this in the very same scene from <cite>O Pioneers!</cite>, where Alexandra says to Carl: "What good comes of offering people things they don't need? I don't need money. But I have needed you for a great many years."</p>
<p>Thinkers as disparate as Aristotle and Nietzsche have long held that giving is more worthy than receiving because giving is more active and flows from an abundance of life and character. Indeed, there is an amusing passage in Aristotle's Ethics wherein he goes back and forth between considering it more noble to oneself do something beautiful or to give a loved one the opportunity to do the beautiful action and thus shine forth in nobility (an internal debate that perhaps only an ancient Greek could engage in!).</p>
<p>Yet, as I say, there is nobility and beauty in graciously receiving, too. There is an analogy here to the arts: the unsurpassed mastery of Sophocles, Michelangelo, Shakespeare, Vermeer, Bach, or Beethoven is a gift of wonder to all mankind, but their artworks possess continued meaning only because millions of human beings have been receptive over the course of centuries to what these artists brought into the world. The same is true of the great philosophers, scientists, reformers, and revolutionaries throughout human history. On a more intimate scale, such influence makes itself felt in every marriage, friendship, workplace, and community.</p>

<h2><a href="2000.html">A Letter</a></h2>
<h3>2025-10-17</h3>
<p>Yesterday I penned a letter to my best friend. And I do mean penned: after rummaging around in a box stashed in a closet, I tracked down some fine stationery I'd bought years ago and, pen in hand, sat down to write. Having been away from letter-writing for decades, I was reminded of a few long-forgotten essentials:</p>
<ol>
<li>Writing a letter by hand is a slow, contemplative activity. The fact that you need to think about what you're going to say before committing it to paper induces a great deal of thought and reflection.</li>
<li>This kind of slow, contemplative writing makes you think with care about the person you're writing to, in two senses: you choose your words carefully so that you can demonstrate the caring thoughts and feelings you have toward this person who is dear to you.</li>
<li>The bodily act of penning a letter leads to a subtle but perceptible embodiment of your thoughts and feelings, for instance in the words you underline or the width of your dashes. Indeed, a writer who is more visually creative than I am might include little doodles, sketch a flower or a cloud, and so on. (Thoreau did this kind of thing in his journal.)</li>
<li>Writing letters is additive; although I talk on the phone with this friend every week or two and text with him nearly every day, writing is an extra mode of communication that does not take away from these more immediately interactive activities.</li>
</ol>
<p>I foresee more letter writing in my future...</p>
