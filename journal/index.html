<h2><a href="1833.html">Understanding What You Know</a></h2>
<h3>2023-11-29</h3>
<p>Recently I discovered two ancient philosophy papers from the 1970s (by Aryeh Kosman and Myles Burnyeat) drawing a distinction between knowledge and understanding. As far as I can tell, Kosman was the first to propose that the Greek word epistēmē is best translated as understanding, and that in fact it means understanding how to explain what you know, in other words understanding why the thing you know is the way it is.</p>
<p>Without delving into their interpretations of Aristotle's <cite>Posterior Analytics</cite>, I must say that this distinction strikes a chord with me. Consider a simple example: we all know that trees shed their leaves in autumn, at least in certain parts of the world. But it's an entirely different matter to understand and explain why that is the case, since doing so requires an understanding of all the botanical, environmental, chemical (etc.) factors responsible for the fall of the leaves.</p>
<p>Now extend this model to something much more complicated: say, the role of self-knowledge in human fulfillment. Ever since the saying "Know Thyself" was first inscribed on the walls of the temple at Delphi 2500+ years ago, everyone has <em>known</em> that the phrase contains great wisdom. Yet it's the task of a lifetime to deeply <em>understand</em> those two little words and integrate them with everything you know about psychological development, individual maturation, the virtues, human relationships, and so on - both in theory and in your own practice of living.</p>
<p>Knowledge is relatively easy; understanding is really, really hard.</p>

<h2><a href="1832.html">Economic Gratitude</a></h2>
<h3>2023-11-27</h3>
<p>Over the last few months I've been tutoring a Ukrainian mom in English as a Second Language through my local library. Several weeks ago she asked me how Americans navigate the world of saving and investment, so I sent her links to one or two of my own blog posts as well as a number of more professional resources. We also had an hourlong discussion about the economic and legal infrastructure for investment that exists in America: stock markets, mutual funds, ETFs, Treasury bills, federal and municipal bonds, REITs, precious metals, commodities, futures markets, 401(k) plans, IRAs, 529 accounts, and all the rest. Folks in the Ukraine and many other countries around the world simply don't have (relatively) trusted investment vehicles like this; in all likelihood, their primary investment method is putting cash under the pillow. We don't realize how fortunate we are to have so many ways to build wealth.</p>

<h2><a href="1831.html">The Primacy of the Prompt</a></h2>
<h3>2023-11-16</h3>
<p>While re-reading Robert Sokolowski's excellent book <cite>Phenomenology of the Human Person</cite> recently, I came across a fascinating quote from Derek Bickerton's book <cite>Language and Human Behavior</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
The problems animals solve, the problems we solve, are our <em>own</em> problems.... But the problems computers solve are not problems for computers. If I have a problem, it's my problem. If my computer has a problem, it's still my problem. Nothing is a problem for it, because it doesn't interact with the world. It just sits there and waits for me to give it <em>my</em> problems.
</blockquote>
<p>This is why LLMs like ChatGPT have a prompt. The LLM doesn't figuratively or literally walk into my office and say "hey, I've been thinking about this problem I've got and I'd like to bounce around some potential solutions with you"; in the terms I introduced a few weeks ago, the LLM isn't <em>sentient</em> because nothing is <em>salient</em> for it. For this reason, in contrast with folks who are excited about the prospect of artificial intelligence, I find these systems to be fundamentally boring.</p>

<h2><a href="1830.html">Tragedy vs. Atrocity</a></h2>
<h3>2023-11-16</h3>
<p>Ever since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, I've been bothered by a point of language. All too often (most recently in relation to the October 7 pogrom in Israel), people say that such events are a tragedy, but this is not correct because it implicitly relieves the participants of moral responsibility. A pogrom, a massacre, a terrorist attack, a genocide - these are not tragedies, they are atrocities. Yes, it's a tragic <em>situation</em> that, say, there was until very recently an Armenian exclave within the borders of Azerbaijan; but the <em>act</em> of forcibly expelling those Armenians was an atrocity. The same applies to pogroms of Russian Jews in the 19th and 20th centuries, Turkey's genocide of Armenians during World War I, the Holocaust against European Jews carried out by Nazi Germany with the collaboration of other fascist regimes, the Rwandan genocide of Tutsi people by Hutu militias in 1994, and so many other acts of collective violence throughout human history. We could even say it's tragic that human beings are so prone to atrocities, but moral responsibility for the atrocities themselves must be assigned to the people who instigate and participate in them. Precision on this point is extremely important, as a matter of both linguistic accuracy and ethical clarity.</p>

<h2><a href="1829.html">RFC 9525: Service Identity in TLS</a></h2>
<h3>2023-11-08</h3>
<p>In November of 2002, I attended my first meeting of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the premier standards-setting organization for the Internet. Since that initial exposure at IETF 55 in Atlanta, I have chaired working groups, run Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions, acted as an expert reviewer, and served on the Internet Engineering Steering Group and the RFC Series Oversight Committee. As of today, I've also authored 49 documents in the IETF's Request for Comments (RFC) series, which puts me in roughly the top 1% of RFC authors. The RFC published today is an updated specification for verifying the identity of servers in the context of Transport Layer Security, which is the primary protocol for protecting communication over the Internet (think the 's' in 'https'). I co-authored the previous version of this document (RFC 6125) with Jeff Hodges and this new version with Rich Salz, both of whom were a pleasure to work with. Although I still have a few residual IETF commitments, this RFC will in all likelihood be the last one I author, since my writing energy is now devoted to philosophy books, not technical specifications. At least I'm going out with a bang, because this document (along with RFC 9325, which I also co-authored) is cited by well over a hundred other RFCs and thus plays a significant role in helping to keep the Internet secure.</p>

<h2><a href="1828.html">Be Careful What You Measure</a></h2>
<h3>2023-10-27</h3>
<p>In business, it's often said that "if you can't measure it, you can't manage it." This aphorism is frequently attributed to Peter Drucker, although wrongly; instead it's pulled from a saying by quality expert W. Edwards Deming, despite the fact that his point was the exact opposite: "It is wrong to suppose that if you can't measure it, you can't manage it – a costly myth."</p>
<p>Yet this costly myth not only persists but causes damage far beyond the business world. Consider a recent essay by research scientist Peter Gray, in which he offers a compelling argument that the significant rise in teen suicide since 2008 can be attributed largely to a misguided culture of measurement in American schools. Specifically, in response to the No Child Left Behind legislation passed in 2001, students (and thus indirectly their teachers and schools) have been measured incessantly through standardized tests, causing ubiquitous teaching to the test and endless pressure on students to perform, perform, perform. Aside from causing thousands of deaths by suicide, all this testing doesn't even measure anything meaningful, for a full understanding of the world around us isn't something that a standardized test can quantify.</p>
<p>Here's a much more ancient example: the Nicene Creed. In the early Christian community, the emerging orthodoxy felt keen competition from the Gnostics, who emphasized the gradual attainment of wisdom and spiritual insight. That was too much work for the orthodox, who instituted something much simpler: a creed which anyone could recite, whether mindfully or mindlessly - but if they didn't, they could be quickly dismissed as a heretic. Aside from causing several genocidal atrocities such as the Albigensian crusade, the Nicene Creed doesn't even measure anything meaningful, for authentic wisdom and spirituality can be judged only through intensive - I would even say loving - interaction among the individuals involved.</p>
<p>These are only two examples that illustrate a more general maxim: be careful what you measure!</p>
