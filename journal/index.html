<h2><a href="1730.html">It's Values All the Way Down</a></h2>
<h3>2022-08-18</h3>
<p>One often hears the claim that science must be value-neutral, especially in social sciences like economics, psychology, and sociology. This claim is one instance of fact-value dualism: the doctrine that facts are facts, values are values, and never the twain shall meet. Another instance of this dualism is the assertion (traceable to British empiricist David Hume) that you can't derive an "ought" from an "is".</p>
<p>Given my well-known aversion to dualisms of all kinds, it should come as no surprise that I'm not impressed by these claims and assertions. For those who are inclined to theoretical philosophy, a fine rebuttal can be found in Hilary Putnam's book <cite>The Collapse of the Fact/Value Dichotomy</cite>. Here's how I would illustrate the matter in a more homely fashion...</p>
<p>Empiricist: Science must be value-neutral!</p>
<p>Me: So you're saying that scientists ought to practice value-neutrality?</p>
<p>Empiricist: Yes, of course!</p>
<p>Me: Or, in other words, that value-neutrality is a core value of all scientific endeavor?</p>
<p>Empiricist: Indeed it is!</p>
<p>Me: Well then, it sounds like science isn't value-neutral with regard to the value of value-neutrality, is it?</p>
<p>Empiricist: Hmm...</p>
<p>This might sound like a purely abstract issue, but it has very practical consequences. For instance, in economics the doctrine of fact-value dualism leads theorists to say that all we can study is utility-maximization; because utility is essentially equivalent to pleasure (cf. Jeremy Bentham) or in scientifically dressed up language "desire satisfaction", this doctrine effectively smuggles hedonism in through the back door. So much for value-neutrality!</p>
<p>The solution to this kind of smuggling is to trade openly in values, as it were: to be honest about the values we bring to the topic before us, to engage in dialogue with those who see things differently, to critique and revise our commitments where necessary, and so on. Naturally, this is difficult and messy, but it's much more realistic and reasonable than trying to rule values out of court with a wave of one's hand.</p>

<h2><a href="1729.html">There's No Such Thing as the Mind</a></h2>
<h3>2022-08-11</h3>
<p>Not long ago, a friend recommended that I check out the work of Italian philosopher Maurizio Ferraris, so I promptly ordered his book <cite>Manifesto of New Realism</cite> via interlibrary loan. Overall it is a valiant attempt to dig out of the hole of postmodernism - valuable, at the very least, for those who have fallen into that particular hole in the first place. Ferraris identifies one aspect of the constraints I talked about recently, in the form of what he calls "unamendability" (i.e., the fact that some aspects of reality cannot be changed by human wishes and ideas). On page 35 of the English translation, he writes:</p>
<blockquote>As I said, I propose we define this fundamental character of reality's "unamendability": the fact that what we face cannot be corrected or changed by the mere use of conceptual schemes, unlike what happens in the hypothesis of constructivism. This, however, is not only a limit, it is also a resource. Unamendability, in fact, informs us about the existence of an external world, not in relation to our body (which is part of the external world) but in relation to our minds and more specifically with respect to the conceptual schemes with which we try to explain and interpret the world.</blockquote>
<p>I'd like to draw attention to his astounding claim that one's body is part of the external world! This implies that there exists an internal world consisting only of a <em>thing</em> called mind. To believe this is to commit the fallacy of reification: treating an abstraction (in this case certain activities of human beings, for instance speech, understanding, and concept-formation) as an independently existing entity (in this case "the mind"). It's surprising to me that an otherwise quite sophisticated thinker could accept the conceptual crudities of this kind of mental idealism, but so it seems to be.</p>
<p>For myself, I prefer a common-sense personalism that considers each human being to be an integrated whole with an indivisible identity.</p>

<h2><a href="1728.html">Controversies</a></h2>
<h3>2022-08-04</h3>
<p>While reading the autobiography of Charles Darwin a few weeks ago, I came across the following passage:</p>
<blockquote>I rejoice that I have avoided controversies, and this I owe to [Charles] Lyell, who many years ago, in reference to my geological works, strongly advised me never to get entangled in a controversy, as it rarely did any good and caused a miserable loss of time and temper.</blockquote>
<p>This passage is slightly ironic, because no scientific work has been more controversial over the last 175 years than Darwin's theory of evolution. Clearly, Darwin did not shy away from explosive topics, so what did he mean by avoiding controversies?</p>
<p>A peek at my trusty 1828 edition of Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language yielded a definition I immediately fell in love with: a controversy is "an agitation of contrary opinions" (similar, perhaps, to a murder of crows or an exaltation of larks, as I explored long ago in my nonsense poem "The Problem of the One and the Many").</p>
<p>Because I said quite enough on the subject of opinions in a series of blog posts last year, today I'd like to think about the agitation aspect.</p>
<p>Agitation implies a number of phenomena, all negative: a violent stirring of emotions, a tumultuous confusion of voices, a disorderly mob of opposing groups, and the like. In the agitation of contrary opinions, there are two primary vicitms:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The reasonable weighing of evidence and insights in pursuit of truth and wisdom.</li>
  <li>All feelings of calm, tranquility, and serenity (as Darwin put it: "a miserable loss of [good] temper").</li>
</ol>
<p>Sadly, we all seem to be in a state of constant agitation these days, tossed about in a neverending battle of in-groups vs. out-groups in which we're nearly forced to take one side or the other side. But only nearly: each of us can decide to step outside the fray, to go beyond binary allegiances, to focus on the eternities, to never get entangled in the deafening controversies that keep us divided - but instead to think with clarity based on evidence and act with integrity based on principle.</p>
<p>There's a good reason why I don't pontificate about current controversies at my weblog, and I plan to keep it that way.</p>

<h2><a href="1727.html">Mental Junk Food</a></h2>
<h3>2022-08-01</h3>
<p>These days every article, video, podcast, or tweet needs to scream for your attention. Even worse, much of what you're shown online is determined by algorithms that put a premium on popularity, which is itself driven by the all-too-human feelings of greed for sensation and fear of disaster. In this brave new world of ours, news is literally a form of mental junk food.</p>
<p>One solution, of course, is to quit consuming the news. However, despite the fact that I've been on a low-information diet for many years and I endeavor to read not the times but the eternities, I recognize that it's not so easy for everyone to break the habit of believing that recently manufactured information is more important than agelessly organic wisdom.</p>
<p>Another solution might to heighten your awareness of what you're consuming. Just as nutrition labels have nudged many people toward better eating habits, perhaps we need nutrition labels for online content. Unfortunately, there are billions of web pages and thousands of news websites, so we can't hand-curate all that content. Paradoxically, we need computers to save us from the computers.</p>
<p>Enter Otherweb, a different sort of news service that gives you objective summaries of the latest news (without ads), enables you to set minimum quality levels, and even shows its work by providing helpful nutrition labels. If you want to learn what's new without that sugar high of mental overstimulation, I highly recommend giving Otherweb a try (and, if you're so inclined, providing feedback at Product Hunt). Your mind will thank you.</p>
<p>[Full disclosure: I'm an advisor to Otherweb because I strongly agree with its mission of fixing the world's information ecosystem.]</p>

<h2><a href="1726.html">Constraints</a></h2>
<h3>2022-07-28</h3>
<p>Recently I read two interesting quotes about the presence of constraints in life. The first was in a book of interviews on poetic structure entitled <cite>Fourteen on Form</cite>, in which one of the poets observed that students of his accustomed to writing free verse often didn't like writing in meter or rhyme because they couldn't say exactly what they wanted to say. The second was in an interview with the late, great jazz pianist and composer Lyle Mays, who said that you need to face some restrictions in order to stimulate creativity and have interesting problems to solve (you can hear the results in his final work, entitled Eberhard).</p>
<p>These statements are paradoxical. Isn't complete freedom the ideal? Aren't constraints distressingly limiting? How can I be my "true self" (a topic for another day) if I'm hemmed in by restrictions?</p>
<p>I don't see it that way. Great artworks like Shakespeare's sonnets or Bach's cello suites grew out of the very constraints of the forms in which the artists worked. Great buildings like Fallingwater do justice to their site and of course need to keep out the wind and rain (even though Frank Lloyd Wright is reputed to have said that "it's not architecture if the roof doesn't leak"!). Great athletes like Michael Jordan or Roger Federer are, after all, playing a game with well-defined rules. Great companies can't just do whatever they want but need to make products and services that both meet the needs of their customers and turn a profit so that they can stay in business. Great friendships and marriages are founded in give and take, mutual respect, and compassion that flows in both directions. Et cetera.</p>
<p>As the quote from Lyle Mays indicates, the positive power of constraints is not just about the outcome but more fundamentally about the process. Creatively solving a challenging problem is deeply engaging, whereas "tennis without a net" is simply a bore because it is way too easy.</p>
<p>So here's to constraints!</p>

<h2><a href="1725.html">Both Sides, Now</a></h2>
<h3>2022-07-21</h3>
<p>You hear it all the time: "this is a topic that both sides can agree on" ... "both sides are to blame for this mess" ... "she is one of those rare people who appeals to both sides" ... and so on.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>The first mistake we make is in thinking that there are only two perspectives, two outlooks, two worldviews, two groups.</p>
<p>For example, recently while visiting some relatives of mine in Canada I glanced at a book by Canadian journalist Stephen Marche entitled <cite>The Next Civil War</cite>, which seems to be based on the assumption that there are two sides arrayed against each other ready to go to war (!) over the future of America.</p>
<p>Puh-lease!</p>
<p>This kind of simplistic sensationalism makes good copy and no doubt sells books, but it's false to the much more complicated realities of life. Even in the relatively benighted realm of politics (which I attempt to studiously avoid), folks like the Pew Research Center (see their political typology report) recognize that there are more than two affiliations in America. For myself, I count economic conservatives, social conservatives, populists, centrists, liberals, progressives, Greens, socialists, libertarians, and probably a few others. (For a deep analysis of the four founding cultures in America, read <cite>Albion's Seed</cite> by historian David Hackett Fischer.)</p>
<p>To go even further, looking at the world in terms of isms is itself a simplification, because when you start talking about particular issues (say, strategies to address homelessness or proposed zoning changes in your locality) things can get nuanced rather quickly and it's not necessarily easy to predict where actual people will come down on such issues.</p>
<p>Recall the old joke: "There are only two kinds of people in the world: those who think there are two kinds of people in the world, and those who don't." You can be part of the solution by going beyond binary and recognizing that there are multiple perspectives out there, not just two.</p>
<p>P.S. Musically attuned readers will have already recognized that the title of this post refers to the great Joni Mitchell song "Both Sides, Now" (which was featured in last year's delightfully predictable yet heartwarming movie CODA).</p>
