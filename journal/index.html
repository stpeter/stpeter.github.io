<h2><a href="1895.html">A Republic If You Can Keep It</a></h2>
<h3>2024-08-30</h3>
<p>Every year around Independence Day, I carve out time to read and reflect on the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution; and every year I notice something new. This year it was the first clause in Article IV, Section 4: "The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government." As with everything else in the Constitution, this "guarantee clause" has been analyzed historically, legally, and philosophically over the last 200+ years. Although I'm not a scholar of the Constitution and don't plan to become one, my curiosity was piqued, so I decided to gain a slightly better understanding of republicanism (with a small "r").</p>
<p>James Madison, the primary framer of the Constitution, defined republicanism as that form of government "which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people", thus opposing it to governments in which some or all of the powers are held by one person or a certain faction of the people. In his book <cite>From Oligarchy to Republicanism: The Great Task of Reconstruction</cite>, Forrest A. Nabors observes that "a key test of republicanism is whether the people for whom the law is made are the makers of the law", in contrast to the "imperial rule" that obtains "when an outside power makes the law for others who must live by the law" (p. 11) - which, of course, was the condition of the colonies before independence. He also notes that Madison was not impressed by the novel constitutional interpretations put forward decades later by John C. Calhoun and his ilk, whom he called "disciples of aristocracy, oligarchy or monarchy" (p. 13).</p>
<p>According to Nabors, perhaps the most daring innovation of the framers was to attempt the founding of a <em>large</em> republic; unlike the small republics of, say, ancient Athens or Renaissance Venice, the U.S.A. was designed to scale up indefinitely. A key constitutional construct intended to make large-scale republicanism work in practice was federalism: "'the division and organization of power' between the national government and the state governments" whereby "powers appropriate to national objects were enumerated and given to the national government in the Constitution" while "all others remained with the states" (p. 11) - or, as the Tenth Amendment says, even "reserved to the people".</p>
<p>Over time, the American people have progressively discarded federalism, so that more and more powers have been concentrated in the central government. It strikes me that this hasn't worked out all that well, since decision-making happens ever more distantly from the people, most things have been "nationalized" so tussles over policy seem increasingly existential, and more and more the laws and regulations promulgated in the District of Columbia feel like imperial impositions by an "outside power".</p>
<p>Even though a healthy dose of federalism might be part of the cure for our partisan death spiral, I'm not optimistic that collectively we'll come to that realization unless truly pressed to seek radical solutions to what ails the American body politic.</p>
<p>In any case, political musings like these, while interesting at times, touch on matters that are far outside my span of influence and control, so I try not to engage in them very often. Your mileage may vary. :-)</p>

<h2><a href="1894.html">Pyrrho in the Light of Homer</a></h2>
<h3>2024-08-28</h3>
<p>Only the merest wisps of evidence remain for the thoughts of Pyrrho, the founder of ancient Greek skepticism and, perhaps, the bringer of Buddhism to Greece. Like Socrates, Pyrrho wrote nothing. His disciple Timon of Phlius did some writing, but almost all of it is lost. The primary text that has survived from antiquity is a brief passage in the <cite>Preparation for the Gospel</cite> by the Christian polemicist Eusebius of Caesarea (4th century AD), who quotes from Book VIII of <cite>On Philosophy</cite> by the Peripatetic philosopher Aristocles of Messene (1st century AD), who in turn cites but doesn't seem to precisely quote Timon. That's not much to go on!</p>
<p>According to Aristocles by way of Eusebius, Timon said Pyrrho held that "πράγματα are equally ἀδιάφορα, ἀστάθμητα, and ἀνεπίκριτα" (from which certain interesting behavioral recommendations follow, such as cultivating a lack of opinions about the πράγματα). Some scholars, such as Christopher Beckwith, try to puzzle out the meaning of these terms by looking to early Buddhism. That can be enlightening, but another worthwhile approach is to ponder these terms in the context of earlier Greek philosophy, literature, and theology. Having just re-read the <cite>Iliad</cite> for the second time this year and also having just read <cite>Homer on the Gods and Human Virtue</cite> by Peter J. Ahrensdorf, I think I've identified a connection worth pursuing.</p>
<p>Through close study of the <cite>Iliad</cite> and the <cite>Odyssey</cite>, Ahrensdorf observes that the Greek gods (Zeus, Hera, and the rest) are "unpredictable, whimsical, and capricious beings" (p. 57) who are "mysterious" (p. 246), "unreliable" (p. 59), and "fundamentally indifferent" (p. 59) to the fates of human beings. Taking our cue from the fact that one meaning of πράγματα is "fortunes" or "circumstances", we can see that from a theological perspective the gods are indifferent (ἀδιάφορα), unreliable (ἀστάθμητα), and inscrutable (ἀνεπίκριτα) regarding the fates and fortunes of human beings. If we take the gods to be personifications of natural processes and events, then it stands to reason that a Greek thinker deeply steeped in Homer might draw conclusions about human affairs that appear similar to early Buddhism. For example, Beckwith argues that ἀδιάφορα is equivalent to Buddhist anātman, ἀστάθμητα to Buddhist dukkha, and ἀνεπίκριτα to Buddhist anitya. While he might be right, we don't <em>necessarily</em> need the Buddhist angle to make sense of ancient reports about Pyrrho's stance toward things human and divine. Indeed, the two lines of argument might corroborate and reinforce each other, or even reflect an underlying insight common across several Indo-European cultures. As I work on research and writing of an epic poem about Pyrrho, I'll continue to reflect on these matters and provide further reports on what I learn.</p>

<h2><a href="1893.html">Tao Te Ching §2: What-Is and What-Is-Not</a></h2>
<h3>2024-08-26</h3>
<p>In my continuing experimentation with the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite>, here's a draft rendering of the second chapter:</p>
<blockquote>
When the world knows what is beautiful<br>
Only as the beautiful<br>
What's ugly comes to be<br>
When the world knows what is good<br>
Only as the good<br>
What's evil comes to be<br>
<br>
What-is gives birth to what-is-not<br>
What-is-not gives birth to what-is<br>
Hard completes easy, easy completes hard<br>
Long measures short, short measures long<br>
High supports low, low supports high<br>
Music tunes voice, voice tunes music<br>
Front follows back, back follows front<br>
<br>
Therefore the sages<br>
Work without doing<br>
Teach without talking<br>
Gain mastery without commanding<br>
Create without possessing<br>
Act without contending<br>
Succeed without flaunting<br>
Thus their success is everlasting
</blockquote>
<p>The poem begins by hinting at the dangers of deifying those who are good and beautiful (the kind of people whom the ancient Greeks called the <em>kalokagathoi</em>): if you insist on seeing only the good in someone (say, the ruler of your country) then you won't be open to clear-eyed perception (say, legitimate questioning of authority). This idea is generalized and extended into some profound paradoxes that are well worth contemplating in their bidirectional glory. And, as always, Lao Tzu brings it all back to practical insights that point toward a more sagacious way of life...</p>

<h2><a href="1892.html">Homeric Style</a></h2>
<h3>2024-08-18</h3>
<p>As previously noted, my stylistic intent in writing an epic poem about Pyrrho and Alexander the Great is to have it sound as if translated into modern English iambic pentameter from the ancient Greek dactylic hexameter of a Hellenistic author deeply influenced by Homer. To do this convincingly, I need to have a firm grasp on Homeric style. Here Matthew Arnold's 1861 lectures "On Translating Homer" are invaluable. He identifies four key features of the Homeric poems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Homer's verse flows swiftly and easily; there is nothing slow or labored about it.</li>
<li>Homer's diction and syntax are plain, direct, and natural - not fanciful, convoluted, or contrived.</li>
<li>The same is true of his thoughts and ideas.</li>
<li>Above all, Homer's poetry has grandeur and nobility.</li>
</ol>
<p>Arnold helpfully contrasts these qualities of Homer against other epic poets (say, Milton) and adduces numerous examples where translators of Homer into English (Pope, Chapman, etc.) have gone astray in one respect or another. In my experience, the translator who has best rendered Homeric style in English translation is the incomparable Richmond Lattimore, whose <cite>Iliad</cite> I'm now revisiting for the second time this year (to be followed by a second re-reading of the <cite>Odyssey</cite>). Lattimore's versions are simply masterful and I'm learning a great deal from close study of his work.</p>
<p>As to my "Pyrrhiad": to date I've written only ~300 lines, so don't get too excited yet!</p>

<h2><a href="1891.html">Tao Te Ching §81: True Words</a></h2>
<h3>2024-08-14</h3>
<p>Following up on my previous postings about the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite>, here is one possible rendering of the very last poem, number 81:</p>
<blockquote>
The true words aren't the pretty words<br>
The pretty words are far from true<br>
The good man argues not at all<br>
The arguer is far from good<br>
The wise man doesn't know it all<br>
The know-it-all is far from wise
<br><br>
The sages aren't acquisitive<br>
The more they help, the more they have<br>
The more they give, the more they gain<br>
The Way of Heaven is to help and do no harm<br>
The Way of sages is to act and not compete
</blockquote>
<p>I love how Lao Tzu ends by saying, in beautiful words, that beautiful words are far from true. That's quite a twist and makes you ponder the meaning of the entire book...</p>

<h2><a href="1890.html">Walking with Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics VI.5</a></h2>
<h3>2024-08-08</h3>
<p>In VI.5, Aristotle finally turns to a deeper analysis of phronēsis. I render this term as "wisdom", whereas others render it as "practical wisdom" (the standard these days), "practical judgment" (Joe Sachs), or "prudence" (prevalent in older translations). The wise person - the phronimos - is "able to deliberate beautifully about things that are good and advantageous, not in part, such as the sort of things that are conducive to health or strength, but the sort of things that are conducive to living well as a whole" (1140a25-28, Sachs translation). By the way, here "conducive" renders πρὸς, the same preposition we find in πρὸς τὸ τέλος, which is Aristotle's phrase for "that which takes us closer to completion" or "that which is toward the goal" - where the goal is living well as a whole, i.e., success [eupraxia] or fulfillment [eudaimonia].</p>
<p>For Aristotle, wisdom is a truth-seeking trait that is suffused with thinking and directed toward taking action [hexis alēthē meta logou praktikēn]. Wisdom is allied with moderation [sōphrosunē] because moderation saves wisdom [sōzousan tēn phronēsin] by preserving the kind of hupolēpsis that is involved in deliberation. I've never been fully clear on what hupolēpsis is, so I had to research that. In his translation of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>, Joe Sachs renders it as "judgment", but that seems too definitive. In his commentary on Book VI and in his paper "Hupolêpsis, Doxa, and Epistêmê in Aristotle", C.D.C. Reeve renders it as "supposition", but that doesn't strike me as all that helpful, either. The root sense is taking something up or considering it in an open-minded manner, such that you might go one way or the other (cf. epamphoterizōmen in the Magna Moralia, 1197a30-31). Thus hupolēpsis is a precursor to drawing a conclusion, forming a judgment, or making a commitment [proharesis] - and not the result of the act of consideration.</p>
<p>As we saw in our discussion of <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> Book III.10-12, moderation saves this kind of "mindedness" because it helps us avoid the greed for pleasure and the fear of pain. Here Aristotle expands on that idea in rather dramatic fashion, since he says that these passions destroy [diaphtherei], deform [diastrephei], and disable [diephtharmenoi] your character, your capacity to deliberate, and your knowledge of the human good. It seems these passions do this by short-circuiting open-minded consideration of the situation and the alternatives it presents. For the decadent person whose policy is to unthinkingly pursue every pleasure that comes along, no consideration or deliberation takes place - this person bypasses thinking altogether, which is why their actions are not "meta logou": they can't actually provide an account for what they do. By contrast, the wise person never completely bypasses their capacity for thought, even when they react quickly in a given situation, because they have deliberately formed commitments to doing what's beautifully right. Plus, they are aware that the truest judgment always resides in the particulars, where is where wisdom really comes into its own.</p>
<p>At the end of VI.5, Aristotle highlights several differences between wisdom [phronēsis] and craft [technē]. First, he says that although there is a virtue [aretē] associated with the beautifully right use of a craft, the craft itself is not a virtue or excellence or thriving of the soul; however, wisdom in itself is indeed such an thriving. Second, wisdom is not merely a trait that is suffused with thinking or can provide an account [meta logou], but is intimately bound up with character; as Aristotle says, a sign of this you can forget a craft but there is no forgetting [lēthē] of wisdom. This might indicate that wisdom is most of all the kind of thing that is true, since the Greek word for truth [alēthē] means, at root, "unforgetting". Perhaps we'll see later in our walk with Aristotle whether this bud will bloom into something of greater significance for people who take life seriously.</p>
