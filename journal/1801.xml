<p>Twelve years ago when I was in Taipei for a weeklong standardization meeting, I snuck off one morning to visit the former home of Lin Yutang, where I bought a copy of his 1937 masterpiece <cite>The Importance of Living</cite>. Every few years I dip into this book, and each time I'm reminded of things I never should have forgotten. What a treasure it is! I definitely need to add it to my list of best friend books.</p>
<p>This time around, I got hooked by reading one of the essays toward the end (not "The True Aim of Education" but "Why I Am a Pagan") and decided to start over from the beginning. Throughout, Lin provides deep insights and charming anecdotes that illustrate what he aptly calls the importance of living. Not for him philosophical theory divorced from our common humanity and the pursuit of happiness; rather, he knows that wisdom has no value if lacks practical applications or is not enjoyable for its own sake. He is such a master of personalism and "what is near" that I'm tempted to call him not Lin but Lin-tse (or "Master Lin") on the model of the great Chinese Taoists Lao-tse and Chuang-tse. An absolute delight!</p>
