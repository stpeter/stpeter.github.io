<h2>Noisy World</h2>
<h3>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>

<h3>2007-01-17</h3>
    <p>Why is the world so full of noise? So many people yammering on the phone all day like they can't stand to be alone in their own silence and solitude for more than two minutes. Television sets blaring away at the airport and the car repair place and the dentist's office. Those incessant announcements about homeland security threat levels being raised to orange or puce or mauve or whatever it is now. The visual noise of advertisements and billboards and pop-up ads and junk mail and spam. The vitriolic ravings and ceaseless chatter of talk radio and politicians and pundits. It's all gliding over the surface of things, indicative of a fundamental fear of diving deep into understanding, introspection, and reflection. And I'm tired of it!</p>
    <p>End rant.</p>
