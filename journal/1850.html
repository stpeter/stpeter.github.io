<h2>Pair Reading</h2>

<p>Over the last few months I've taken up a new practice: reading with friends. The concept is simple: choose a friend, choose a book, slowly read it, and exchange notes on each chapter as you go along. It's kind of like pair programming for intellectual exploration.</p>
<p>So far I've been reading (or I'm about to start reading) the following books:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<cite>Phenomenology of the Human Person</cite> by Robert Sokolowski with my friend A. in Texas, who knows a great deal about psychology but wants to learn more about philosophical ways of thinking.</li>
  <li>
<cite>The Enigma of Reason</cite> by Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber with my friend J. in Nova Scotia, who has a background in anthropology and a fascination with ancient and modern skepticism.</li>
  <li>
<cite>Being and Time</cite> by Martin Heidegger with my friend D. in Colorado, who has long done reading and research in cognitive science and epistemology.</li>
  <li>
<cite>The Glass Bead Game</cite> by Hermann Hesse with my friend M. in Oregon, who has studied German philosophy and literature and who likes philosophical novels as much as I do.</li>
  <li>
<cite>In Praise of Shadows</cite> by Jun'ichir≈ç Tanizaki with my friend P. in Oregon, whom I met through our mutual interest in Epicurus and who has an aesthetic bent that I really appreciate.</li>
</ul>
<p>That might sound like a lot, but since we read slowly (a chapter every week or two), it's easy enough to make leisurely progress.</p>
<p>As to why I'm not reading books in larger groups as you might find in a college seminar or the Catherine Project, I feel that the one-to-one interaction (e.g., the choice of books to read) is more tailored to my relationship with a specific person and thus approaches more closely what Emerson in his essay on friendship called "the high freedom of great conversation, which requires an absolute running of two souls into one".</p>
<p>Naturally, in parallel I'm maintaining my own "single reading" (currently focused on Aristotle's <cite>Metaphysics</cite>), but I find the pair reading even more rewarding.</p>
