<h1>The Tao of Roark</h1>
<h2>by Peter Saint-Andre</h2>
<p>Millions of people have been inspired by <cite>The Fountainhead</cite>, Ayn Rand's story of architect Howard Roark and his epic struggle for creative freedom.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/The-Tao-Roark-Variations-Theme/dp/0615822959/'><img src="/images/tao-small.jpg" width="225" height="360" border="0" alt="Tao of Roark" align="right"/></a>Yet inspiration is not enough: you need a blueprint for turning that vision into a flourishing life of joy and reason and meaning.</p>
<p><cite>The Tao of Roark</cite> provides that blueprint.  It builds the foundation for greater freedom, dignity, depth, and beauty in life.
