<h1>The Ism Book: A Field Guide to Philosophy</h1>
<h2>by <a href="/">Peter Saint-Andre</a>
</h2>
<p>The currently featured <a href="ism.html">ism</a> is:</p>
<blockquote class="featured"><p><a href="panentheism.html">panentheism</a>: The doctrine that everything is in God or that everything is a mode or attribute of God. This idea is subtly different from <a href="pantheism.html">pantheism</a>, since it doesn't assert that God and Nature are identical. Panentheism is often associated with exponents of <a href="rationalism.html">rationalism</a> such as Leibniz (1646-1716) and especially Spinoza (1632-1677).</p></blockquote>
