<h2>Looking up at the Sky</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p><em>December 22, 1999</em></p>
<p>
My friend, this solstice moon reminds me to look up at the sky&nbsp;&mdash;<br />
The brightest moon in a hundred years, they say, but right now I<br />
Can't see the features I like best for all this blinding light:<br />
The things my father taught to me on moonless winter nights,<br />
When we would walk up to Clifton Park (where summers I played ball)<br />
And peer at the deep of space to find the Dippers large and small,<br />
The twins, the bull, Orion's Belt, but most of all the Queen's Chair,<br />
My favorite since harder to find and closer to my scale<br />
And the scale of my father's love. My eye seeks it even still<br />
Among the million numberless stars &mdash; the stars that I feel will,<br />
Fighting distance, connect me to you, to my passed father's life,<br />
To the numberless millions who lived on earth before my time,<br />
To the numberless more who'll live here once I'm gone &mdash; or who may,<br />
For all I know, not live here at all but venture out away<br />
Into space, expand the home of man. For them the stars will be<br />
Their park (will they play with comets as I played ball?) &mdash; yet I see<br />
In my mind's eye that sometimes they'll look back at where the earth must lie<br />
And feel as I do when, thinking of you, I look up at the sky.
