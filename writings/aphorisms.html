<h1>Peter Saint-Andre: Aphorisms</h1>
<p>Last Updated: 2021-12-15</p>
<p>Distrust all gurus; instead, be your own guru; even then, distrust yourself.</p>
<p>The easiest thing in the world is self-deception.</p>
<p>Perfection is not an option.</p>
<p>Happiness is the best revenge.</p>
<p>There's no monopoly on hypocrisy.</p>
<p>You don't have to achieve an ideal to realize the benefits of idealism.</p>
<p>Philosophy is a verb, not a noun.</p>
<p>The self is not a natural endowment, but a personal achievement.</p>
<p>Ethics is what you do, not what you profess.</p>
<p>Someone who tells you how ethical they are, probably isn't.</p>
<p>Everyone is weird, it's a question of specifically how.</p>
<p>Having an open mind doesn't mean you need to close your eyes.</p>
<p>If you think well of your own opinions merely because they're yours, then you're not thinking well.</p>
<p>The most powerful thoughts involve no thoughts of power.</p>
<p>To avoid groupthink, avoid groups.</p>
<p>Demonization and deification are two sides of the same false coin.</p>
<p>Morality is telling people how to be; metaphysics is telling reality how to be.</p>
<p>Spend time with your loved ones; they can't be replaced.</p>
<p>Questions are quick; answers are slow.</p>
<p>On the path to wisdom, it's always better to walk than to run.</p>
<p>A good life is embodied wisdom.</p>
<p>Don't puzzle over the meaning of life; instead, work to create a life of meaning.</p>
<p>Just because you have good and beautiful things of great worth, does not mean you are living a good and beautiful and worthy life.</p>
<p>Don't envy those who envy others.</p>
<p>I strive to shed my illusions as easily as the snake sheds its skin; yet the fact that I must strive shows how hard it truly is.</p>
<p>If someone tells you that your window of opportunity is closing, remember: a beautiful house has many windows.</p>
<p>Creation is a singularly rare event; most of life &mdash; even of art, religion, and philosophy &mdash; is a matter of maintenance.</p>
<p>School is wasted on the scholar.</p>
<p>The sophist justifies what is desired; the philosopher desires what is justified.</p>
<p>A book of poems is like a box of chocolates &mdash; best not consumed in one sitting.</p>
<p>Any sufficiently complex phenomenon has a multitude of causes.</p>
<p>Politics is a disease: an unhealthy distraction from everything that truly matters in life..</p>
<p>The assertion that the personal is the political both trivializes and collectivizes the most human of our experiences.</p>
<p>If you can conceive of morality without god, why can you not conceive of society without government?</p>
<p>If you can conceive of spirituality without faith, why can you not conceive of government without coercion?</p>
<p>A courthouse or a legislature no more proves the existence of government than a church or a monastery proves the existence of god.</p>
<p>Any government that makes war on its own people has lost the consent of the governed and thus all moral legitimacy.</p>
<p>The problem with elections is that those who get elected think they are the elect.</p>
<p>Democracy is what happens when actual people hold power &mdash; not their so-called representatives.</p>
<p>Party politics represents the triumph of in-group psychology.</p>
<p>Utopia is not an option.</p>
<p>Specialists always overestimate the importance of their specialties.</p>
<p>Many characteristics of modern music &mdash; its agitation, its emotionalism, its seductiveness, its lack of inhibitions &mdash; are caused by the fact that it is performed after dark by night people.</p>
<p>We moderns, especially we Americans, are perpetual children, preferring entertainment to wisdom and momentary pleasures to a good life.</p>
<p>Everything is great, but no one strives for greatness.</p>
<p>Although we like to believe that technologies are our tools, in fact we are tools of our technologies.</p>
<p>Enormous, impersonal, irresponsible organizations are the inevitable result of limited liability, which was legislated into existence in the early nineteenth century; there is nothing natural about them.</p>
<p>The unexamined organization is not worth building.</p>
<p>The health of an organization's culture is inversely proportional to the amount of time it spends talking about its culture.</p>
<p>Sometimes the best thing to do is not the fastest or most efficient thing to do. This is called learning.</p>
<p>We can learn much about modern society from adjectives that have passed out of use; consider ‘villainous’, ‘base’, and ‘unseemly’.</p>
<p>The clothing that people wear today reveals much about their bodies, but it reveals even more about their souls.</p>
<p>Never underestimate the power of a false alternative.</p>
