<h1>Complete Thyself: Aristotle on Human Fulfillment</h1>

<p>Inscribed at the entrance to the temple of Apollo at Delphi were two sayings that the ancient Greeks revered: γνῶθι σαυτόν ("Know Thyself") and μηδὲν ἄγαν ("Nothing To Excess"). Even today, 2500 years later, we recognize that there is great wisdom in these sayings. Yet it is no easier for us than it was for the ancients to truly understand and live by that wisdom.</p>
<p>Aristotle, one of the greatest minds of ancient Greece and indeed all human history, grappled deeply with the question of how to live - so much so that Dante called him "il maestro di color che sanno": the master of those who know. Not only are the truths that Aristotle found beautifully compelling but, suitably adapted to modern circumstances, they can help us live the best life possible today.</p>
<p>His fundamental insight is that the only way to really <em>know thyself</em> is to <em>complete thyself</em>: to fully develop and activate your capacities as a human being, foremost among them your yearning to understand the world you live in, and based on that understanding to take beautifully right action in your relationships and community. At root, his vast writings are an unfolding and elucidation of this truth.</p>
<p>Aristotle's wisdom in these matters runs deep, for it is rooted in the biocentric conception of mind and life he developed by founding the sciences of logic and biology. Indeed, he held that living things are the most natural of things, and that human beings are the most natural of living beings.</p>
<p>For Aristotle, aliveness is a continuum. All living things have needs for sunlight, water, warmth, nutrition, reproduction, homeostasis, and the like. Animals, because they have perception and movement, not only have needs but also wants and thus seek to gain what appears to them beneficial or good; they not only live, but have a way of life. Humans, because we have reason and speech and a sense of the future, not only have underlying needs and immediate wants, but we also generate wishes, form preferences, make commitments, and take action structured under the aegis of a long-term goal; we can succeed in both reflection and conduct; not only can we live, but live well and achieve fulfillment.</p>
<p>Living well is a continuum, too. There are many ways to miss the mark in life and only a few ways to hit it.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Some people are from birth so lacking in forethought and other basic human capacities that sadly they lead a kind of animal existence (although such a state can also be induced by a brutal upbringing such as that imposed in ancient times by the Scythians).</p></li>
<li><p>Others, altogether the worst, fall so far short of their human potential that they descend into corruption and thus choose purposes that are unworthy, take actions that are harmful or bad, and act for reasons that are downright ugly.</p></li>
<li><p>Somewhat better are those who wish for what is good but whose thoughts and actions can be warped by harmful or excessive desires and pleasures, so that they act impulsively or experience self-indulgence; they might function well in many areas of life but miss the mark in areas where they cannot resist temptation (e.g., they might be unfaithful spouses, heavy drinkers, social climbers, or shallow materialists).</p></li>
<li><p>The more decent sort of human being experiences the same kind of desires and pleasures, but is able to overcome them through force of will, and thus to act with self-control.</p></li>
<li><p>Altogether good are those who activate the highest human capacities, achieve personal excellence, and thus truly enjoy acting for the sake of what is admirably appropriate and beautifully right.</p></li>
<li><p>Even beyond such human thriving might lie a kind of godlike excellence or blessedness verging on transcendence of the all-too-human, but Aristotle doesn't provide a detailed roadmap for approaching it, even as an ideal.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Human beings are not only the most natural, but also the most complex, of animals. If they are not guided by reason, humans can be the worst of animals; if they are guided by reason, they can be the best. But what does it mean to be "guided by reason"? In essence it means thinking things through as an ongoing practice and settled disposition, taking counsel with yourself or others before taking action, being minded in a measured way, and living what Socrates called an examined life.</p>
<p>This practice of wisdom or mindfulness enables you to have a balanced response to your experiences. Without such a practice, you act and react in an unbalanced way; for example, you might get angry with the wrong people, in the wrong situations, too quickly, too strongly, for the wrong reasons, and so on. Your aim is wayward, and you miss the target. The primary causes of missing the mark are the lure of pleasure, the avoidance of pain, the temptation of gain, and the fear of loss &mdash; in all their specific forms and in the many domains of life such as bodily pleasures, social interactions, and monetary affairs.</p>
<p>Although balanced activity is pursued not for the sake of enjoyment or for the sake of advantage, yet paradoxically it brings the greatest enjoyment and the greatest benefit in life.</p>
<p>All the excellences of character take the form of a middle range between overdoing or underdoing a certain form of action or reaction, guided by the correct kind of thinking and yearning. Many of the excellences Aristotle discusses in his writings are still important today (e.g., justice, generosity). However, because of the more communal and uncertain nature of ancient society, Aristotle emphasized thrivings that we no longer value as highly (e.g., valor in battle, righteous anger), whereas the more individualistic and materially abundant nature of the modern world leads us to value qualities that Aristotle did not mention (e.g., productivity, financial responsibility).</p>
<p>This raises the question: was Aristotle an individualist? He certainly wasn't an altruist in the modern sense. In many ways, his philosophy goes beyond individualism vs. altruism through his focus on personal relationships of love, family, friendship, and community, in which each person acts for the sake of the other.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for Aristotle the best activities are performed not for the sake of either enjoyment or advantage, but for the sake of what is admirably appropriate and beautifully right. This is true not only of particular actions, but more deeply at the level of your character, your way of being, your lifestyle.</p>
<p>Following ancient Greek tradition, Aristotle distinguished between three fundamental kinds of purpose: a life of enjoyment, a life of community involvement, and a life of inquiry. Conspicuously absent from this list are ways of life that nowadays we consider valuable, such as a professional calling (say, being a doctor or entrepreneur) or creative achievement (say, being a writer or an artist). We might be able to broaden Aristotle's categories to include such pursuits, for instance by seeing how professionalism is a form of philanthropy and how creativity is a kind of inquiry. It also helps to look at Aristotle's three ways of life as a thought experiment: what would you do if you were financially independent? Would you have fun, give back, or seek truth?</p>
<p>At the beginning of his <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite>, Aristotle says that not having an overall goal for your life is the height of foolishness. By contrast, the height of wisdom is knowing what kind of life you want to craft for yourself &mdash; who you want to be, with whom you want to share your life, what you want to learn and achieve, and how to cultivate the best within you. Through experience and reflection and deliberate practice, you can find success at the great task of crafting a life well lived and achieving the deepest fulfillment possible to human beings. Aristotle's deep insights into human life can provide invaluable guidance in that essential endeavor.</p>
<p>To orient you on our walk with Aristotle, here's a map of key points we'll cover on the trail ahead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Living a good and fully human life is not a matter of fate or luck, but the task of a lifetime.</li>
<li>That task consists in being successful at activating your capacities for doing, feeling, and thinking.</li>
<li>Although some people seem to naturally excel at some aspects of this task (e.g., to be naturally moderate or courageous), such inborn propensities can lead you astray because they are not guided by understanding, reflection, and deliberation.</li>
<li>Conventional virtue consists in adherence to laws and customs, but this too can mislead us because laws and customs can become irrational and corrupt through people’s boundless pursuit of power, wealth, prestige, etc.</li>
<li>Complete thriving of character is deliberate, committed action for the sake of what is beautifully right, and this can be achieved only by internalizing the correct account for fully human doing and feeling.</li>
<li>This complete thriving, when applied in all of our relationships, is rightly called justice.</li>
<li>However, justice cannot be reduced to rules and thus requires a deep humaneness to be applied reliably in all situations.</li>
<li>Wisdom (the combination of good character with good judgment) is a generalization of humane, situational decision making.</li>
<li>Moreover, love, friendship, and brotherhood (which add mutual good will on top of wisdom) are more important than justice.</li>
<li>The highest worth of love is not receiving love but bestowing love as a thoroughgoing activity of living well together with those who are dear to you.</li>
<li>The source of worth is not pleasure, but freely chosen, beautifully right activity for its own sake (however, it naturally happens that this kind of activity is the most reliably enjoyable).</li>
<li>These strands of love and wisdom come together in the love *of* wisdom, which is the highest pursuit of human beings because living an examined life provides the ultimate account for the most truly fulfilling way of life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, in the last chapter we will explore how to apply these insights to the practice of life in modern society.</p>
