<h1>Contemplating Contemplation</h1>
<h2>Theoria, Praxis, and Energeia in Aristotle's Ethics</h2>
<h2>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h2>

<p><em>This paper is a work in progress, not to be cited as definitive in any way. Last updated: 2025-04-01.</em></p>

<p>The role of θεωρία (commonly translated as contemplation) in Aristotle's ethical theory has long been a matter of keen dispute. In this paper I compare and contrast θεωρία with πρᾶξις and connect both concepts with ἐνέργεια to cast θεωρία in a new light.</p>

<h3>I. Fields of Meaning</h3>

<p>As Aryeh Kosman observes in a discussion of ἐνέργεια [note], a word from ancient Greek does not necessarily map exactly to a word in modern English; each word is used to cover a field of meaning, and the fields might not overlap. As I see it, this is definitely true with the mapping of θεωρία onto contemplation.</p>
<p>First, although translation of Greek θεωρία into Latin <em>contemplatio</em> was reasonable in the context of the Roman reception of Greek philosophy over 2000 years ago, since then the meaning of Latin <em>contemplatio</em> and then French/English contemplation has drifted significantly from its Greek source (similar changes have occurred with philosophical vocabulary such as virtue, substance, and essence). In particular, consider that the earliest use, and for centuries the most common use, of the term contemplation in English referred to religious musing and devout meditation within Christianity; similarly, the contemplative life was one given up to religious contemplation and prayer to the Christian God, especially in the spirit of the Middle Ages. (OED, s.v.) Yet Aristotle preceded Christianity by centuries, of course, and he never mentions prayer or religious devotion with respect to θεωρία. Naturally there are other senses of contemplation and contemplative, but they tend to center around a core meaning of somewhat passive, unfocused musing. Thus on the face of it we cannot safely assume that θεωρία always or ever means for Aristotle precisely what contemplation means for us.</p>
<p>Second, although the cognate term θεωρητικός is often translated as "theoretical", the connection between theory and contemplation is far from clear; indeed, we would normally consider both ancient and modern scientific theory to be diametrically opposed to the religious attitude that suffused the contemplative life of Medieval Christendom. Furthermore, it can be dangerous to essentially transliterate an ancient Greek word into a current English word that re-uses the Greek root; rendering θεωρητικός as theoretical might make no more sense than rendering ἐνέργεια as energy.</p>
<p>Third, some uses of θεωρία and θεωρεῖν seem to be located outside the contemplative field we're accustomed to. For instance, at EE V.5 / EN VI.5 1140b7-10 Aristotle mentions that the action-oriented statesman Pericles excelled at θεωρία when guiding the course of the Athenian polis. More substantively, at two points in Aristotle's discussion of ἀκρασία within EE VI / EN VII (1146b31-35 and 1153a20-23) he seems to use θεωρεῖν to mean something close to "be aware of", "attend to", "keep in mind", or "maintain a mental hold on". Indeed, my working hypothesis is that this sense of θεωρία as awareness is close to the focal meaning of the term, or at least closer than θεωρία as contemplation.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, in what follows I shall attempt to behold θεωρία with fresh eyes, free from the Latinate and Christian overtones that the concept of contemplation has accreted over the centuries. In particular, following the lead of scholars from John Burnet to the present, I shall take a dialectical approach by tracing the progression of θεωρία, θεωρεῖν, θεωρητικός, and cognate terms on their parallel tracks through the <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite> and <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>, then onward from there into the <cite>Metaphysics</cite>.</p>
