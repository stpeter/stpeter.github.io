<h2>A Chronology of Events Related to the Life of Aristotle</h2>
<p>(All dates are BCE.)</p>
399 &mdash; Socrates is executed at Athens for impiety and corrupting the youth; Plato flees to Megara, eventually returning to Athens<br/>
384 &mdash; Birth of Aristotle at Stagira, a town in northern Greece founded in 655 BCE by Ionian settlers from Andros<br/>
382 &mdash; Birth of Philip II, son of Amyntas III, king of Macedon<br/>
~380 &mdash; Aristotle's father Nicomachus begins serving as personal physician to Amyntas<br/>
~373 &mdash; Aristotle's parents die under unknown circumstances, whereupon he is cared for by his older sister Arimneste and her husband Proxenus at Atarneus in Ionia<br/>
369 &mdash; Death of Amyntas III<br/>
368 &mdash; Aristotle, in his 16th year, travels to Athens to study, perhaps initially with Isokrates since at the time Plato was away in Sicily serving the tyrant Dionysius<br/>
365 &mdash; Plato returns to Athens; Aristotle studies and works with Plato for the next 18 years<br/>
361 &mdash; Plato again travels to Syracuse<br/>
360 &mdash; Plato returns from Syracuse<br/>
359 &mdash; Accession of Philip II as king of Macedon<br/>
356 &mdash; Birth of Alexander the Great, son of Philip by his fourth wife Olympias<br/>
348 &mdash; Philip destroys the city of Olynthus (an ally of Athens) and other settlements on the peninsula of Chalkidiki, including Stagira; because of anti-Macedonian sentiment, Aristotle leaves Athens for Atarneus, perhaps as a diplomatic agent of Philip<br/>
347 &mdash; Death of Plato at Athens<br/>
~346 &mdash; Aristotle marries Pythias, the niece or adopted daughter of Hermias<br/>
345 &mdash; Aristotle relocates to the island of Lesbos, where he completes much biological research at the Bay of Kalloni with his student and friend Theophrastus<br/>
341 &mdash; Hermias is captured, tortured, and killed by the Persians; Aristotle returns to mainland Greece or Macedonia<br/>
338 &mdash; Battle of Chaeronea, in which Philip's army defeats those of Athens and Thebes; Antipater (perhaps with assistance from Aristotle) acts as Macedonian ambassador to Athens<br/>
~337 &mdash; Death of Aristotle’s wife Pythias<br/>
336 &mdash; Assassination of Philip; accession of Alexander the Great as king of Macedon<br/>
335 &mdash; While putting down a rebellion of Greek cities, Alexander destroys Thebes but spares Athens, seemingly at the intercession of Aristotle; Aristotle returns to Athens, where he stays until 323<br/>
334 &mdash; Alexander invades Persia with a large army, including Aristotle’s nephew Kallisthenes as official historian; Antipater becomes regent of Greece; Aristotle begins teaching at the Lyceum, a sanctuary and gymnasium just outside the walls of Athens<br/>
327 &mdash; Kallisthenes is executed for conspiring to assassinate Alexander<br/>
324 &mdash; Death of Alexander at Babylon<br/>
323 &mdash; Because of renewed anti-Macedonian sentiment (and, it seems a charge that like Socrates he was impious), Aristotle leaves Athens for Chalkis, where his mother's family has an estate<br/>
322 &mdash; Death of Aristotle at Chalkis
