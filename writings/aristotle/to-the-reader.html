<p>If you are an intellectually curious person who continually strives to become a better, wiser human being, this book was written with you in mind. Although Aristotle lived over 2300 years ago, his works still offer timeless guidance to people like us today.</p>
<p>For ease of reading, this book is divided into two parts.</p>
<p>Part 1 is a succinct epitome that provides a clear and actionable synposis of Aristotle's conception of human fulfillment. These eighty pages are likely all that you'll need or want to read; however, because my presentation is rather condensed, it rewards slow, reflective reading.</p>
<p>Part 2 is an expanded commentary that explains the philosophical grounding and textual evidence for the epitome. Normally I would not include such a section in a book of this nature, but the scholarly literature on Aristotle is so vast that it would be irresponsible not to justify my interpretations.</p>
<p>Throughout the text, capitalized words such as Wisdom and Fulfillment provide consistent renderings of key terms in Aristotle's philosophical vocabulary; these terms are defined on first use and gathered together in the glossary.</p>
