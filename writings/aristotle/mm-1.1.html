<h1>Aristotle's Great Ethics</h1>
<h1>Book I, Chapter 1</h1>
<h2>Translated by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h2>
<p>Because we have committed to speaking about matters of character, first we must ask: of what is character a part? In brief it seems to be nothing other than a part of citycraft. For one can't take action in the city's affairs without being of a certain quality, I mean seriously good. And to be seriously good is to have the thrivings of character. Thus if one is to take action in the city's affairs, one must have a seriously good character. It seems, then, that what concerns character is part of and a source of citycraft. Indeed it seems to me that the whole subject should be called, not soulcraft, but citycraft.</p>
<p>Therefore we must, it seems, speak first about thriving of character, both what it is and from what it comes to be. For there it's useless to know of such thriving if we don't grasp how to bring it into being and from what. We must look into not only what it is but also how it will come about, for we must resolve not only to know it but to <em>be</em> it - and we can't do this if we don't know where it comes from and how to make it so. It really is necessary to know what thriving is, since it's not easy to where it comes from and how it comes about, just with other kinds of understanding). Thus we must take notice of what others before us have said on the topic.</p>
<p>Pythagoras it was who first strove to speak about thriving of character, but he went astray. For, by reducing thriving to numbers, the awareness he gained was not inherent to thriving itself. Justice is not the square of some other number!</p>
<p>Next came Socrates, who spoke better and more fully about these matters, but even he went astray, for he made the thrivings into forms of understanding. Yet this can't be so, because all forms of understanding are bound up with an account of things, and such accounts are found in the aspect of a person that thinks things through; thus all the thrivings would come to be in the aspect of a person that calculates and reflects. Indeed the result is that by making the thrivings into forms of understanding he throws out the non-rational aspect of personhood, and by doing so he throws out feelings and character. In this way, then, he went astray in grasping the thrivings of character.</p>
<p>After that, Plato rightly analyzed personhood into the aspect having reason and the non-rational aspect, and assigned fit thrivings to each. Up to this point he proceeded beautifully, but from then on he went astray. For in his treatment of the thrivings he mixed in the good, and that goes astray because it's foreign to the topic. Someone who speaks about Being and Truth shouldn't make declarations about thrivings of character, because the two have nothing in common.</p>
<p>This is as far as they got and how they proceeded; next we must see what we can say on the topic.</p>
