<h1>Aristotle's Great Ethics</h1>
<h1>Book I, Chapter 1</h1>
<h2>Translated by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h2>
<p>Because we are committed to speaking about matters of character, first we must look into that of which character is a part. In brief it seems to be nothing other than a part of politics. For one isn't able to act in matters of state without being of a certain quality, I mean seriously good. And to be seriously good is to have the thrivings of characters. Thus if one is to take action in matters of state, one must have a seriously good character. It seems, then, that what concerns character is a part and source of politics. Indeed it seems to me that the whole subject should be called politics, not ethics.</p>
