CHAPTER 1: FULFILLMENT

1.1 Four Ways of Life

We begin with a thought experiment.

Imagine you have earned enough money that you no longer need to work. What would you do with the rest of your life?

Aristotle gives you four options:

1. Making Money
2. Having Fun
3. Giving Back
4. Seeking Truth

Although we’ll look at more alternatives in the last chapter, these are the four ways of life that came to mind for the ancient Greeks.

Aristotle quickly dismisses the first option: you already have enough money, so why would you organize your life around earning even more money?

One justification might be to amass the things that only extreme wealth can buy: more luxurious pleasures, higher status in society, power over others, outsized influence in government, even the possibility of becoming a supreme ruler oneself. Reading between the lines, as we often must do, we can see Aristotle dismisses these desires, too. So the life of Making Money doesn’t make the cut.

The second option has wider appeal, in ancient times as well as today: after all, we moderns have had our heads filled with endless visions of la dolce vita, complete with travel to exotic locations, fun in the sun, wining and dining, amusements and entertainments, fancy cars, fashionable clothes, second homes, and everything else our consumer-oriented society has to offer.

While Aristotle is not one of those ascetic philosophers opposed to enjoying life, at the same time he is not in favor of unreflectively satisfying the unlimited desires of the natural self. In fact, he holds that the self is not a natural endowment at all, but a personal achievement.

More specifically, Aristotle maintains that an impulsive person is buffeted about in many directions and lacks the consistency of thought, desire, action, and emotion necessary to have a self in the first place. Similarly, he insists that someone who is thoroughly corrupted or vicious has strayed so far from the inherent potentials of human existence as to also lack true selfhood.

For us this is counter-intuitive, because we tend to think that nothing is more natural than the self, and that the self consists of whatever thoughts, desires, actions, and emotions a person happens to have; this is why we also tend to think that someone who acts to satisfy their arbitrary desires is selfish.

By contrast, Aristotle and other ancient Greek thinkers hold that a person’s desires are not unquestioned urges to be unthinkingly gratified, but raw materials to be pruned, moulded, shaped, and sculpted. Only by advancing though a process of education, cultivation, maturation, and soulcraft could one graduate to living a fully human life. Therefore someone who mindlessly satisfies their arbitrary desires isn't necessarily building up their selfhood or personhood - it all depends on whether those desires are informed by deliberation and reflection. And that’s definitely not the case for the life of Having Fun.

The third option, Giving Back, better befits someone who takes life seriously. This is the life of civic engagement, philanthropic endeavor, educating the young, honoring the old, healing the sick, strengthening the well, upholding religion, cultivating brotherhood, providing wise leadership in your community, and all the other pursuits that fall under the broad heading of statecraft.

This way of life is more beautifully right than Making Money or Having Fun because human beings are inherently social creatures. We are born into a society that existed long before we arrived and will exist long after we are gone. The activities that define our highest possibilities as human beings - language, history, technology, medicine, the sciences, the arts, religion, philosophy - are sustained and extended only by continued collaboration across generations and millennia. Both individually and collectively, we need to work at being human.

Thus you can achieve great nobility in statecraft, if you can avoid the ever-present temptations of power and privilege. As we’ll see in Chapter 2, two thrivings of character in particular are key to right conduct in the social realm: moderation and justice. These virtues can be difficult to cultivate and put into practice, but they are worthy of aspiration for anyone who wants to be successful as a human being.

So is an active life centered on Giving Back as good as it gets, or does human nature harbor even higher possibilities?

Wherever philosophy has arisen - especially in the ancient civilizations of Greece, China, and India - thinkers have speculated that there is something more. This something more has gone by many names: the examined life, the love of wisdom, living in truth, the vita contemplativa. The yearning for this fourth way of life is inspired not by the action-oriented wisdom of statecraft, but by the passionate search for passionless truths, for understanding the human condition, for deep insights into the nature of existence and what it means to be human - in a word, for sagacity.

In founding the sciences of logic and biology, and in contributing fundamentally to nearly every intellectual discipline existing in his day, Aristotle laid claim to the designation that Dante bestowed on him some 1500 years later: “the master of those who know.” Few people have equalled Aristotle in the fourth way of life, which we can call Seeking Truth.

Certainly Aristotle rose into the rarified air of world-historical intellectual achievement, but as we’ll explore in Chapter 5 sagacity is not limited to scientists and philosophers; instead, it is open to anyone who takes truth seriously by stretching out toward greater awareness and understanding.

Finally, these four ways of life are not necessarily exclusive or antagonistic: properly understood, they build on each other, can be pursued with different weights at different times of life, and at some level must be combined in order to find true fulfillment in life. This will be one of our primary themes on our long walk with Aristotle.
