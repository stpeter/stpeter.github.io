<h1>Complete Yourself</h1>
<h2>Aristotle on Personal Excellence</h2>
<h2>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h2>
<p>
The timeless message of Aristotle’s philosophy is that your course in life is determined primarily by your character: it’s not a matter of fate or luck, but of choice and effort. Your highest goal is the realization and completion of your nature and potential - an achieved excellence of doing and feeling and thinking, of character and wisdom.</p>
<p>Yet Aristotle’s world was very different from ours. The ancient Greeks lived in small communities, their economy was largely based on slavery, their society considered women to be second-class citizens, their thinkers were aristocrats who devalued productive work, lacking telescopes they assumed that the stars and planets were immortal beings, and so on.</p>
<p>Given the great gulf between Aristotle’s world and ours, how can we apply his insights to living a better life in modern society? This book will show you how.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Although Aristotle's views on human flourishing are very deep and thus can be hard to understand, much of that difficulty stems from poor translations of his <a href='concepts.html'>key concepts</a> and from a short-sighted focus on his <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> without considering his writings on nature, animals, human beings, communities, knowledge, emotion, education, or even his <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite>. This brief epitome will be a friendly guide to his conception of the good life.</p>
<p>As I <a href='/journal/1508.html'>work through</a> Aristotle by <a href='readings.html'>re-reading</a> his writings (along with some of the <a href='exploration.html'>secondary literature</a>), making <a href='notes.html'>notes</a>, and composing a <a href='draft.html'>rough draft</a>, I'm also occasionally posting snapshots of my research:</p>
