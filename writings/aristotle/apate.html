<h1>ἀπάτη in Aristotle</h1>
<h2>translated by Peter Saint-Andre</h2>
<p>The following passages constitute occurrences of the term ἀπάτη in the works of Aristotle.</p>
<ul>
  <li>23b13-15 here Aristotle argues that if someone says that the good is actually bad, then they are engaging in deceit</li>
  <li>47b38 ἡ ἀπάτη γίνεται ἐν τῷ παρὰ μικρόν = "this form of deception arises from something small"</li>
  <li>66b19 συμβαίνει δ᾽ ἐνίοτε, καθάπερ ἐν τῇ θέσει τῶν ὅρων ἀπατώμεθα, καὶ κατὰ τὴν ὑποληψιν γίνεσθαι τὴν ἀπάτην = "it sometimes happens that just as we are deceived in the arrangement of definitions, so also deception arises from taking them up for consideration"</li>
  <li>67a27-67b11 τῇ μὲν οὖν καθόλου θεωροῦμεν τὰ ἐν μέρει, τῇ δ᾽ οἰκείᾳ οὐκ ἴσμεν, ὥς ἐνδέχεται καὶ ἀπατᾶσθαι περὶ αὐτά, πλὴν οὐκ ἐναντίως, ἀλλ᾽ ἔχειν μὲν τὴν καθόλου, ἀπατᾶσθαι δὲ τῇ κατὰ μέρος … οὐδὲν γὰρ τῶν αἰσθητῶν ἔξω τῆς αἰσθήσεως γενόμενον ἴσμεν, οὐδ᾽ ἃν ᾐσθημένοι τυγχάνωμεν, εἰ μὴ ὠς τῷ καθόλου καὶ τῷ ἔχειν τὴν οἰκείαν ἐπιστήμν, αλλ᾽ οὐχ ὡς τῷ ἐνεργεῖν. τὸ γὰρ ἐπίστασθαι λέγεται τριχῶς, ἢ ὡς τῇ καθόλου ἢ ὡς τῇ οἰκείᾳ ἢ ὡς τῷ ἐνεργεῖν, ὥστε καὶ τὸ ἠπατῆσθαι τοσαυταχῶς. οὐδὲν οὖν κωλύει καὶ εἰδέναι καὶ ἠπατῆσθαι περὶ ταὐτό, πλὴν οὐκ ἐναντίως. ὅπερ συνβαίνει καὶ τῷ καθ᾽ ἑκατέρον εἰδότι τὴν πρότασιν καὶ μὴ ἐπεσκεμμένῳ πρότερον. ὑπολαμβάνων γὰρ κύειν τὴν ἡμίονον οὐκ ἔχει τὴν κατὰ τὸ ἐνεργεῖν ἐπιστήμην, οὐδ᾽ αῦ διὰ τῆν ὑπόληψιν ἐναντίαν ἀπάτην τῇ ἐπιστήμῃ · συλλογισμὸς γὰρ ἡ ἐναντία ἀπάτη τῇ καθόλου. = "By the universal we become aware of the particulars, but we do not know them by their inherent particularities; thus we can be deceived about them, not because have what is at odds with the universal but because we have the universal yet are deceived about the particulars ... For we do not know something that can be sensed once it is outside the range of our senses, even if we happen to have sensed it before, except by having the universal, i.e., by having the relevant understanding but not putting it to work. For "understanding" is meant in three ways: understanding of the universal, understanding of the inherent particularities, and putting our understanding to work; thus there are just as many ways of being deceived, too. Indeed nothing prevents one from both knowing and being deceived about the same thing, as long as the two are not at odds. And this happens to one who knows each proposition on its own but has not previously looked into it; for if he considers (say) a mule to be with foal he doesn't have an understanding that is at work, nor through so considering is the deception at odds with his understanding, for a deception at odds with his understanding would be a form of reasoning" (not of perception).</li>
  <li>72b3 ἀπάτης = although OCT translates as "error" something that is the opposite of ἐπιστήμη, "deception" could work here, too (see below)</li>
  <li>74a6-7 ἀπατώμεθα δὲ ταύτην τὴν ἀπάτην = "we are deceived in this deception" (?)</li>
  <li>79b23 ἄγνοια δ᾽ ἡ μὴ κατ᾽ ἀπόφασιν ἀλλὰ κατὰ διάθεσιν λεγομένη ἔστι μὲν ἡ διὰ συλλογισμοῦ γινομένη ἀπάτη = "what is called ignorance not because of disagreement but because of a disposition is a form of deception that comes about through reasoning"</li>
  <li>80a6 ἀπάτη = "deception" (OCT "error")</li>
  <li>80b15 συλλογισμός ἀπατητικός = "deceptive reasoning"</li>
  <li>81a5 διὰ δὲ τοῦ μέσου σχήματος γινομένης τῆς ἀπάτης = "when the deception arises through the middle premise…"</li>
  <li>81a15 ἐὰν μὲν οὖν στερητικὸς ᾖ τῆς ἀπάτης ὁ συλλογισμός = "if the reasoning that leads to deception is privative"</li>
  <li>171b10 καὶ συλλογισμός ἐριστικός καὶ σοφιστικός ἐστιν εἷς μὲν ὁ φαινόμενος συλλογισμός … τοῦ γὰρ διὰ τί ἀπατητικός ἐστι = "one form of contentious and sophistical reasoning is merely apparent reasoning … for it is deception regarding the why"</li>
  <li>171b21 ἀπατητικός καὶ ἄδικος = this kind of reasoning is "deceptive and unfair"</li>
  <li>229b4-6 τὸ μανθάνειν τῷ ἀπατᾶσθαι μὴ δι᾽ αὑτοῦ · εἰς ἐναντία γάρ · ὥσπερ γὰρ ἐπιστήμην, ἔστι καὶ ἀπάτην καὶ δι᾽ αὑτοῦ κτᾶσθαι καὶ δι᾽ ἄλλα. = "being taught [i.e., gaining understanding] is regarded as contrary to being deceived, for they are contraries, just as both understanding and deception can come about either through oneself or through another person"</li>
  <li>418a12 μὴ ἐνδέχεται ἀπατηθῆναι = the special objects of a sense are those about which "it is not possible to be deceived"</li>
  <li>427b5 δοκεῖ δὲ καὶ ἡ ἀπάτη καὶ ἡ ἐπιστήμη τῶν ἐναντίων ἡ αύτὴ εἶναι = "it seems that both deception and understanding about contraries are the same" (in what sense?)</li>
  <li>442b8 essentially the same as 418a12</li>
  <li>756a31 συμβάλλεται δὲ πρὸς τὴν ἀπάτην = "what contributes to their being deceived"</li>
  <li>965a14-16 ὁ γέλως παρακοπή τις καὶ ἀπάτη … τὸ δὲ λαθραῖον ἀπατητικόν = "laughter is a kind of derangement and deception … what's surprising is deceptive"</li>
  <li>1051b25 ἀπατηθὴναι γὰρ περὶ τὸ τί ἐστιν οὐκ ἐστιν ἀλλ᾽ ἢ κατὰ συμβεβηκός = "we are not deceived about what a thing is, except by the way"</li>
  <li>1052a2 τὸ δὲ ἀληθὲς τὸ νοεῖν αὐτὰ · τὰ δὲ ψεῦδος οὐκ εστιν, οὐδ᾽ ἀπάτη, ἀλλ᾽ ἄγνοια, οὐχ οἷα ἠ τυφλότης = "truth means having insight into these things; falsity does not exist, nor deception, but only ignorance, and not an ignorance that is like blindness" (since blindness is not an acquired trait)</li>
  <li>1113a33-1113b2 ἐν τοῖς πολλοῖς δὲ ἡ ἀπάτη διὰ τὴν ἡδονὴν ἔοικε γίνεσθαι: οὐ γὰρ οὖσα ἀγαθὸν φαίνεται = "in most things deception seems to come about through pleasure; for it appears good although it is not"</li>
  <li>1117a25-26 οἱ δ᾽ ἠπατημένοι, ἐὰν γνῶσιν ὅτι ἕτερον ἢ ὑποπτεύσωσι, φεύγουσιν = "those who have been deceived will flee when they know or suspect that things are different" </li>
  <li>1165b10-12 ὅταν δ᾽ ὑπὸ τῆς ἐκείνου προσποιήσεως ἀπατηθῇ, δίκαιον ἐγκαλεῖν τῷ ἀπατήσαντι = "when he has been deceived by the other person's pretences, he can rightly complain to the deceiver"</li>
  <li>1227a32-40 ἡ ἀπάτη οὐκ εἰς τὰ τυχόντα γίνεται, ἀλλ᾽ εἰς τὰ ἐναντία ὅσοις ἐστὶν ἐναντία, καὶ εἰς ταῦτα τῶν ἐναντίων ἃ κατὰ τὴν ἐπιστήμην ἐναντία ἐστίν. ἀνάγκη ἄρα καὶ τὴν ἀπάτην καὶ τὴν προαίρεσιν ἀπὸ τοῦ μέσου ἐπὶ τὰ ἐναντία γίνεσθαι （ἐναντία δὲ τῷ μέσῳ καὶ τὸ πλέον καὶ τὸ ἔλαττον）.—αἴτιον δὲ τὸ ἡδὺ καὶ τὸ λυπηρόν: οὕτω γὰρ ἔχει ὥστε τῇ ψυχῇ φαίνεσθαι τὸ μὲν ἡδὺ ἀγαθὸν καὶ τὸ ἥδιον ἄμεινον, καὶ τὸ λυπηρὸν κακὸν καὶ τὸ λυπηρότερον χεῖρον. = "Deception brings about not some random thing, but its contrary if the contrary exists, and to the contrary as determined by the relevant form of understanding. Therefore it's necessary that both the deception and its associated commitment must stray from the middle way to its opposite (and the opposite of the middle way is either too much or not enough). And what's responsible for this is what's pleasant and painful: for what is pleasant appears good to a person (and the more pleasant the better), and what is painful appears bad (and the more painful the worse)." </li>
  <li>1278a38-40 μέτοικος γάρ ἐστιν ὁ τῶν τιμῶν μὴ μετέχων. ἀλλ᾽ ἐστὶν ὅπου τὸ τοιοῦτον ἐπικεκρυμμένον ἐστίν, ἀπάτης χάριν τῶν συνοικούντων ἐστίν. = "one who is excluded from honors is effectively a resident alien; but when this fact is kept secret, the aim is to deceive one's fellow citizens"</li>
  <li>1304b7-12 κινοῦσι δὲ τὰς πολιτείας ὁτὲ μὲν διὰ βίας ὁτὲ δὲ δι᾽ ἀπάτης, διὰ βίας μὲν ἢ εὐθὺς ἐξ ἀρχῆς ἢ ὕστερον ἀναγκάζοντες. καὶ γὰρ ἡ ἀπάτη διττή. ὁτὲ μὲν γὰρ ἐξαπατήσαντες τὸ πρῶτον ἑκόντων μεταβάλλουσι τὴν πολιτείαν, εἶθ᾽ ὕστερον βίᾳ κατέχουσιν ἀκόντων = "a revolution comes about through force or deception: force either immediately or afterward, deception by first deceiving the citizens into agreeing to the change or by later holding them by force without their ageement" </li>
  <li>1368b21-22 ὁ δὲ ἄφρων διὰ τὸ ἀπατασθαι περὶ τὸ δίκαιον καὶ ἄδικον = "the foolish person [does wrong] though being deceived about what's just and unjust"</li>
  <li>1376b21-23 τὸ μὲν δίκαιον οὐκ ἔστι μετασπέψαι οὔτ᾽ ἀπάτῃ οὔτ᾽ ἀναγκῃ (πεφθκὸς γάρ ἐστιν), συνθῆκαι δὲ γίγνονται καὶ ἐξαπατηθέντων καὶ ἀναγκασθέντων =  "it is impossible to pervert justice by deception or force, since it is founded on nature, but a party to a contract may be the victim of deception or force"</li>
  <li>1377b5 τὰ δὲ βίᾳ καὶ ἀπάτῃ ἀκούσια = actions "due to force or deception are involuntary"</li>
