Laches
Plato
tr. Benjamin Jowett

"SOCRATES: 

And in a word, when he considers anything for the sake of another thing, he thinks of the end and not of the means?

NICIAS: 

Certainly.

SOCRATES: 

And when you call in an adviser, you should see whether he too is skilful in the accomplishment of the end which you have in view?

NICIAS:

Most true.

SOCRATES:

And at present we have in view some knowledge, of which the end is the soul of youth?

NICIAS:

Yes.

SOCRATES:

And we are enquiring, Which of us is skilful or successful in the treatment of the soul, and which of us has had good teachers?" (185d-e)

"LACHES: ... Some would think that I am a lover, and to others I may seem to be a hater of discourse; for when I hear a man discoursing of virtue, or of any sort of wisdom, who is a true man and worthy of his theme, I am delighted beyond measure: and I compare the man and his words, and note the harmony and correspondence of them. And such an one I deem to be the true musician, attuned to a fairer harmony than that of the lyre, or any pleasant instrument of music; for truly he has in his own life a harmony of words and deeds arranged, not in the Ionian, or in the Phrygian mode, nor yet in the Lydian, but in the true Hellenic mode, which is the Dorian, and no other." (188c-d)

"SOCRATES:

That was my meaning when I said that I was to blame in having put my question badly, and that this was the reason of your answering badly. For I meant to ask you not only about the courage of heavy-armed soldiers, but about the courage of cavalry and every other style of soldier; and not only who are courageous in war, but who are courageous in perils by sea, and who in disease, or in poverty, or again in politics, are courageous; and not only who are courageous against pain or fear, but mighty to contend against desires and pleasures, either fixed in their rank or turning upon their enemy. There is this sort of courage â€” is there not, Laches?

LACHES:

Certainly, Socrates." (191c-e)

"NICIAS:

I have often heard you say that 'Every man is good in that in which he is wise, and bad in that in which he is unwise.'

SOCRATES:

That is certainly true, Nicias.

NICIAS:

And therefore if the brave man is good, he is also wise.

SOCRATES:

Do you hear him, Laches?

LACHES:

Yes, I hear him, but I do not very well understand him.

SOCRATES:

I think that I understand him; and he appears to me to mean that courage is a sort of wisdom.

LACHES:

What can he possibly mean, Socrates?

SOCRATES:

That is a question which you must ask of himself.

LACHES:

Yes.

SOCRATES:

Tell him then, Nicias, what you mean by this wisdom; for you surely do not mean the wisdom which plays the flute?

NICIAS:

Certainly not.

SOCRATES:

Nor the wisdom which plays the lyre?

NICIAS:

No.

SOCRATES:

But what is this knowledge then, and of what?" (194c-e)
