The Eudemian Ethics and the Nicomachean Ethics

"[R]ecalling the consensus about the EE's being inclusivist in its approach to eudaimonia, as opposed to the intellectualist, 'dominant-end' conception that many find at the end of the NE, it is not unreasonable to read the EE as more amenable to a qualified type of individualism than the NE, one that does not sharply privilege the theoretical life over the practical." (JOST-2014a, p. 421)
