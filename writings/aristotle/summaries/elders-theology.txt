Aristotle's Theology
Leo Elders (1972)
Assen: Van Gorcum & Comp. N.V.

"[P]erception and knowledge are most desirable for each man individually; however, what gives joy is not so much knowledge in general as awareness of the the fact that we ourselves are knowing..." [PSA: i.e., theoria] (p. 31)

"[F]riendship contributes to self-knowledge and is subservient to it. Man's end and happiness consist in knowledge of the self, which comprizes the ontological treasures of one's being, as well as fulness of activity and awareness of it." (p. 32)
