Rhetoric
Aristotle
tr. Joe Sachs

"The end [telos] is different for each of these, three for the three kinds. For the advisory speaker, it is what is advantageous [sumpheron] or harmful [blaberon], since someone who exhorts is advising something as best, and someone who warns is warning against something as worse; other things, that it is just or unjust, beautiful [kalos] or shameful [aischros], they take in as side-issues to that. For courtroom speakers, it is what is just or unjust; they take in other things as side-issues to those. And for those engaged in praising and blaming, it is what is beautiful or shameful; they bring other things back to refer to these." (1358b20-29)

"[T]hose engaged in praising and blaming do not consider whether someone has performed advantageous or harmful actions, but often they even make it a matter of praise that he did some beautiful thing in disregard of what was profitable to himself; for example, they praise Achilles because he went to the aid of his companion Patroclus in the knowledge that he would have to die, though it was possible for him to live. For him, a death of that sort was a more beautiful thing, though living was advantageous." (1358b38-1359a5)

"The first thing to be taken up, then, is what sorts of good and bad things an advisory speaker [συμβουλέων] gives advice about, since it is not about them all but as many as admit both of happening and of not happening; as for those things that either are or will be the case necessarily, or are incapable of being the case or happening, there is no advice about them. In fact, it is not even about all things that admit of happening or not, since there are some good things among these that happen by nature or from chance, about which giving advice is of no use. But it is clear that advice is concerned with everything there is deliberation [βουλεύεσθαι] about, namely, all the things that are of such a nature as to be traceable back to us, and of which the source of thei coming into being is up to us [ἐφ᾽ ἡμῖν]. We investigate [σκοποῦμεν] things up to that point at which we discover whether they are possible or impossible for us to do. Now itis not required on the present occasion to seek to enumerate each of these particulars with precision, and to divide up into specific kinds the things people are in the habit of consulting about, and to go on to make definitions about them as far as possible in accord with truth [κατὰ τὴν ἀλήθειαν], because that doesn't belong to the rhetorical art but to one more amenable to knowledge and truth. And far more subjects than it properly studies have been given over to it nowadays, for what is true is exactly what we said before, that rhetoric is composed of a knowledge of analytics and of that part of politics that has to do wtih types of character, and is similar in some respects to dialectic and in others to sophistical arguments." (1359a30-1359b17)
