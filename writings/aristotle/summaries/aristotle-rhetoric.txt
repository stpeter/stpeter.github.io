Rhetoric
Aristotle
tr. Joe Sachs

"The end [telos] is different for each of these, three for the three kinds. For the advisory speaker, it is what is advantageous [sumpheron] or harmful [blaberon], since someone who exhorts is advising something as best, and someone who warns is warning against something as worse; other things, that it is just or unjust, beautiful [kalos] or shameful [aischros], they take in as side-issues to that. For courtroom speakers, it is what is just or unjust; they take in other things as side-issues to those. And for those engaged in praising and blaming, it is what is beautiful or shameful; they bring other things back to refer to these." (1358b20-29)

"[T]hose engaged in praising and blaming do not consider whether someone has performed advantageous or harmful actions, but often they even make it a matter of praise that he did some beautiful thing in disregard of what was profitable to himself; for example, they praise Achilles because he went to the aid of his companion Patroclus in the knowledge that he would have to die, though it was possible for him to live. For him, a death of that sort was a more beautiful thing, though living was advantageous." (1358b38-1359a5)

"The first thing to be taken up, then, is what sorts of good and bad things an advisory speaker [συμβουλέων] gives advice about, since it is not about them all but as many as admit both of happening and of not happening; as for those things that either are or will be the case necessarily, or are incapable of being the case or happening, there is no advice about them. In fact, it is not even about all things that admit of happening or not, since there are some good things among these that happen by nature or from chance, about which giving advice is of no use. But it is clear that advice is concerned with everything there is deliberation [βουλεύεσθαι] about, namely, all the things that are of such a nature as to be traceable back to us, and of which the source of thei coming into being is up to us [ἐφ᾽ ἡμῖν]. We investigate [σκοποῦμεν] things up to that point at which we discover whether they are possible or impossible for us to do. Now itis not required on the present occasion to seek to enumerate each of these particulars with precision, and to divide up into specific kinds the things people are in the habit of consulting about, and to go on to make definitions about them as far as possible in accord with truth [κατὰ τὴν ἀλήθειαν], because that doesn't belong to the rhetorical art but to one more amenable to knowledge and truth. And far more subjects than it properly studies have been given over to it nowadays, for what is true is exactly what we said before, that rhetoric is composed of a knowledge of analytics and of that part of politics that has to do wtih types of character, and is similar in some respects to dialectic and in others to sophistical arguments." (1359a30-1359b17)

"For just about every person in private and all people in common there is a certain target [skopos] the are aiming at in the things they choose [hairountai] and avoid [pheugousin], and this, to state it in sum, is happiness and its parts. So for the sake of example, let us take up what happiness, simply stated, is and what its parts consist of, for all exhortations and warnings deal with this and with the things that are directed to this and opposed to it; for it is necessary to perform the actions that provide for this or for any of its parts, or make them greater rather than less, while not performing actions that destroy or impede them [empodizonta] or produce their opposites. So let happiness be good activity [eupraxia] combined with virtue, or self-sufficiency [autarkeia] in living, or the most pleasant life consistent with safety, or abundance of possessions and bodies along with the power to protect and make effective use of them, since everyone pretty much agrees that happiness is one or more of these things. So if happiness is that sort of thing, it is necessary that the following are parts of it: being well born, having many friends, having good friends, having good children, having many children, having a good old age, and also the virtues of the body (such as healthy, beauty, strength, size, athletic power), reputation, honor, luck, and virtue; for this is the way one would be more self-sufficient, if these goods, both within himself and external, were to belong to him, since there are no others besides these. Those within himself are the ones that have to do with the soul and the ones in the body, and the external ones are being well born, friends, possessions, and honor; also, we believe he must attain to positions of power and have luck, since his life would be safest in that way." (1360b4-29)

"[S]ince the target [skopos] immediately before for someone giving advice is what is advantageous (for people deliberate not about the end [telos] but about the means to the end [pros to telos], and these are things advantageous in regard to actions, and what is advantageous is good), what needs to be grasped would be the elements that go into something good and advantageous, taken simply. So let the good be that which is chosen [haireton] itself for its own sake, and for the sake of which we choose something else, and at which all things that have sense perception and intelligence [nous] aim (or would if they were to get intelligence), and all the things that intelligence would give over to each annd all the things that intelligence in each case does give over to each; for the good for each thing is that which, when it is present, puts that thing in a sound and self-sufficient condition, and its good is its self-sufficiency along with the things that tend to produce or preserve such things and the things from which such things follow, as well as the things that prevent and destroy their opposites." (1362a15-29)

It is necessary "for pleasure to be a good thing; for all animals desire it by nature, and so it is necessary for both pleasant things and beautiful things [ta kala] to be good, since the former tend to produce pleasure, while among beautiful things, some are pleasant and others are themselves chosen in virtue of themselves." (1362b5-9)

"To speak of them one by one, it is necessary for the following to be good things. Happiness, since it is both chosen in virtue of itself and self-sufficient, and we choose everything for its sake. Justice, courage, temperance, greatness of soul, magnificence, and other active conditions [hexeis] of that sort, since they are virtues of a soul. Health and beauty and things of that sort, since they are virtues of a body and tend to produce many things, as health tends to produce both pleasure and life, which is why it seems to be the greatest good, because it is responsible for two of the things most honored by most people, pleasure and life. Riches, since that is the virtue of acquisition and tends to produce many things. A friend and friendship, for a friend is chosen in virtue of himself, and also tends to produce many things. Honor and reputation, for they are both pleasant and tend to produce many things, and for the most part the possession of the things for which people are honored goes along with them. The power of speaking [legein] and of action [prattein], for all such things tend produce many good things. Also natural giftedness [euphuia], memory, ease of learning, quickness of mind, and all such things, since these powers tend to produce good things. Similarly, all kinds of knowledge [epistemai] and all arts [technai]. And life, for if no other good thing were to follow from it, it would still be chosen in virtue of itself. And justice, for it is something advantageous in common." (1362b10-28)

"[S]ince often when people agree that both of two things are advantageous, they dispute over which is more so, the next thing to be spoken of would be concerned with the greater good and what brings more advantage. Let what is so much and beyond it be exceeding and what is contained within be exceeded; let greater and more numerous always be relative to less, and great, small, many, and few be relative to the size of most things, and let what exceeds be great and what falls short be small, and the same way with many and few. Now since we call something good that is itself chosen for its own sake and not for the sake of anything else, and something that all things aim at and would choose if they were to get intelligence [nous] and practical judgment [phronesis], and what tends to produce, to preserve, or to follow upon such things, and since an end [telos] is that for the sake of which other things are done, and what has these attributes relatively to a certain person is good for him, it is necessary that more than one of these things, or more than some lesser number, when that one or that lesser number are counted in among them [sunarithmoumenou], would be a greater good; for it exceeds them, and what is included within something is exceeded." (1363b5-22) [PSA: compare the use of "relative" here to the mean πρὸς ἡμᾶς at EN 1106a26ff and EE 1220b21ff; also, compare sunarithmoumenou here to sunkrinomenon at MM 1184a34-38.]

"[W]hat is more choiceworthy [hairetoteron = preferable] in virtue of itself is greater than what is chosen not in virtue of itself; for instance strength is greater than something healthy, since the latter is not chosen for its own sake, but the former is, which is what the good meant. And if one thing is an end while another is not an end; for the latter is chosen for the sake of something else, but the former for the sake of itself, as gymnastic exercise is chosen for the sake of the body's well-being. And that which has less additional need [prosdeomenon] of any other thing or things, since it is more self-sufficient; and what has additional need of fewer things or of things easier to get has need of less. And when this is not present without that, or is not capable of coming into being, but that is without this, the one without the need is more self-sufficient, and is thus manifestly a greater good." (1364a1-9)
