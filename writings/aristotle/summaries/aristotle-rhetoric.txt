Rhetoric
Aristotle
tr. Joe Sachs

"The end [telos] is different for each of these, three for the three kinds. For the advisory speaker, it is what is advantageous [sumpheron] or harmful [blaberon], since someone who exhorts is advising something as best, and someone who warns is warning against something as worse; other things, that it is just or unjust, beautiful [kalos] or shameful [aischros], they take in as side-issues to that. For courtroom speakers, it is what is just or unjust; they take in other things as side-issues to those. And for those engaged in praising and blaming, it is what is beautiful or shameful; they bring other things back to refere to these." (1358b20-29)

"[T]hose engaged in praising and blaming do not consider whether someone has performed advantageous or harmful actions, but often they even make it a matter of praise that he did some beautiful thing in disregard of what was profitable to himself; for example, they praise Achilles because he went to the aid of his companion Patroclus in the knowledge that he would have to die, thought it was possible for him to live. For him, a death of that sort was a more beautiful thing, though living was advantageous." (135838-1359a5)
