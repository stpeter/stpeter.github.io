Nature, Justice, and Rights in Aristotle's Politics
Fred D. Miller
Oxford University Press, 1995.

"The highest aim of the lawgiver and the educator is to promot those actions which involve leisure, peace, and nobility. Leisure is understood as intrinsically valuable activity, and its opposite, absence of leisure, as 'for the sake of something not present' and 'not chosen for itself' (VIII.3 1338a1-6; cf. EN X.7 1177b16-26). The goal of the lawgiver is thus to promote activities of the citizens which are ends in themselves existing for their own sakes (cf. Pol VII.3 1325b20)." (MILLER, p. 226)
