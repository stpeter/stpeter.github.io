"[T]he kalon ... not only has in itself the attraction that goes with the beautiful, but also carries an obligatory force to act in accord with it. So much is this the case that the adjective kalon and the impersonal verb dei, with the meaning of 'ought' or 'should,' are used interchangeably through the Nicomachean Ethics (e.g., II.3 1104b10-12, III.6 1115a12, IV.1 1120a9-1121a4)." (OWENS, pp. 146-147).

"In social life the person who is striving for the kalon has everything regulated by right reason. He is not free to gratify his whims at random.... For free people (tois eleutherois, Metaphysics XII.10 1075a19) the hallmark is strict regulation of conduct by reason. Human freedom, because it proceeds from a rational nature, is conditioned in its very roots by right reason. But that condition is not constraining or necessitating by way of any natural force. The regulating principle and measure remain within. They are the person himself, the phronimos (EN II.6 1107a1-2, III.4 1113a29-33; cf. III.3 1112b31-1113a7)." (OWENS, p. 152)
