"So the other animals live by images and memories, but have a small share of experience [ἐμπειρία], but the human race also lives by art and reasoning [τέχνῃ καὶ λογισμοῖς]. And for human beings, experience arises from memory, since many memories of the same thing bring to completion [ἀποτελοῦσιν] a capacity for one experience. Now experience seems to be almost the same thing as knowledge or art [ἐπιστήμη καὶ τέχνη], but for human beings, knowledge and art result from experience, for experience makes art, as Polus says and says rightly, but inexperience makes chance. And art comes into being whenever, out of many conceptions from experience, one universal judgment [ὑπόληψις] arises about those that are similar." (980b25-981a7)

"For the purposes of acting [πράττειν], experience doesn't seem to differ from art [τέχνη] at all, and we even see people with experience being more successful than those who have a rational account [λόγον ἐχόντων] without experience." (981a12-15)

"Nevertheless, we think that knowing [εἰδέναι] and understanding [ἐπαΐειν] are present in art more than is experience and we take possessors of arts to be wiser [σοφωτέρους] than people with experience, as though in every instance wisdom is more something from and following along [ἀκολουθοῦσαν] with knowing; and this is because the ones know the cause while the others do not. For people with experience know the what, but do not know the why, but the others are acquainted with the why and the cause. For this reason we also think the master craftsmen [ἀρχιτέκτονας] in each kind of work are more honorable [τιμιωτέρους = glorious] and know more than the manual laborers, and are also wiser, because they know the causes of the things they do, as though people are wiser not as a result of being skilled at action, but as a result of themselves having the reasoned account [κατὰ τὸ λόγον ἔχειν] and knowing the causes [τὰς αἰτίας γνωρίζειν]. And in general, a sign of the one who knows and the one who does not is being able to teach, and for this reason we regard the art, more than the experience, to be knowledge [ἐπιστήμη], since the ones can, but the others cannot, teach." (981a24-981b10)

"But once more arts had been discovered, and some of them were directed toward necessities [πρὸς τἀναγκαῖα] but others toward a way of living [πρὸς διαγωγὴν], it is likely that such people as were discoverers of the latter kind were always considered wiser, because their knowledge [ἐπιστήμη] was not directed toward use [πρὸς χρῆσιν]." (981b17-20) [PSA: this implies that a way of life [διαγωγή] is concerned not with useful necessities but with beautiful superfluities]

"Now it has been said in the writings on ethics what the difference is among art, demonstrative knowledge, and the other things of a similar kind, but the purpose for which we are now making this argument is that all people assume that what is called wisdom [σοφία] is concerned with first causes and origins [τὰ πρῶτα αἴτια καὶ τὰς ἀρχὰς]. Therefore, as was said above, the person with experience seems wiser than those who have any perception whatever, the artisan wiser than those with experience, the master craftsman wiser than the manual laborer, and the contemplative arts [θεωρητικαὶ] more so than the productive ones [ποιητικῶν]. It is apparent, then, that wisdom is a knowledge concerned with certain sources and causes." (981b25-982a3)
