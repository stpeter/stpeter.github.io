[these notes are a work in progress]

"So the other animals live by images and memories, but have a small share of experience [ἐμπειρία], but the human race also lives by art and reasoning [τέχνῃ καὶ λογισμοῖς]. And for human beings, experience arises from memory, since many memories of the same thing bring to completion [ἀποτελοῦσιν] a capacity for one experience. Now experience seems to be almost the same thing as knowledge or art [ἐπιστήμη καὶ τέχνη], but for human beings, knowledge and art result from experience, for experience makes art, as Polus says and says rightly, but inexperience makes chance. And art comes into being whenever, out of many conceptions from experience, one universal judgment [ὑπόληψις] arises about those that are similar." (980b25-981a7)

"For the purposes of acting [πράττειν], experience doesn't seem to differ from art [τέχνη] at all, and we even see people with experience being more successful than those who have a rational account [λόγον ἐχόντων] without experience." (981a12-15)

"Nevertheless, we think that knowing [εἰδέναι] and understanding [ἐπαΐειν] are present in art more than is experience and we take possessors of arts to be wiser [σοφωτέρους] than people with experience, as though in every instance wisdom is more something from and following along [ἀκολουθοῦσαν] with knowing; and this is because the ones know the cause while the others do not. For people with experience know the what, but do not know the why, but the others are acquainted with the why and the cause. For this reason we also think the master craftsmen [ἀρχιτέκτονας] in each kind of work are more honorable [τιμιωτέρους = glorious] and know more than the manual laborers, and are also wiser, because they know the causes of the things they do, as though people are wiser not as a result of being skilled at action, but as a result of themselves having the reasoned account [κατὰ τὸ λόγον ἔχειν] and knowing the causes [τὰς αἰτίας γνωρίζειν]. And in general, a sign of the one who knows and the one who does not is being able to teach, and for this reason we regard the art, more than the experience, to be knowledge [ἐπιστήμη], since the ones can, but the others cannot, teach." (981a24-981b10)

"But once more arts had been discovered, and some of them were directed toward necessities [πρὸς τἀναγκαῖα] but others toward a way of living [πρὸς διαγωγὴν], it is likely that such people as were discoverers of the latter kind were always considered wiser, because their knowledge [ἐπιστήμη] was not directed toward use [πρὸς χρῆσιν]." (981b17-20) [PSA: this implies that a way of life [διαγωγή] is concerned not with useful necessities but with beautiful superfluities]

"Now it has been said in the writings on ethics what the difference is among art [τέχνη], demonstrative knowledge [ἐπιστήμη], and the other things of a similar kind, but the purpose for which we are now making this argument is that all people assume that what is called wisdom [σοφία] is concerned with first causes and origins [τὰ πρῶτα αἴτια καὶ τὰς ἀρχὰς]. Therefore, as was said above, the person with experience seems wiser than those who have any perception whatever, the artisan wiser than those with experience, the master craftsman [ἀρχιτέκτων] wiser than the manual laborer, and the contemplative arts [θεωρητικαὶ] more so than the productive ones [ποιητικῶν]. It is apparent, then, that wisdom is a knowledge concerned with certain sources and causes." (981b25-982a3)

"[S]urely the skill that is suited to teach is the one that has more insight into causes [ἡ τῶν αἰτιῶν θεωρητικὴ], for those people teach who give an account of the causes [οἱ τὰς αἰτίας λέγοντες] about each things." (982a28-30)

"[T]he most ruling [ἀρχικωτάτη] of the kinds of knowledge, or the one more ruling than what is subordinate to it, is the one that knows for what purpose each thing must be done [τίνος ἕνεκέν ἐστι πρακτέον]; and this is the good [τἀγαθὸν] of each thing, and in general the best thing in the whole of nature [τὸ ἄριστον ἐν τῇ φύσει πάσῃ]. So from all the things that have been said, the name sought falls to the same kind of knowledge, for it must be a contemplation of the first sources and causes [πρώτων ἀρχῶν καὶ αἰτιῶν εἶναι θεωρητικήν], since also the good, or that for the sake of which [τὸ οὗ ἕνεκα], is one of the causes." (982b4-10)

"[B]y way of wondering [θαυμάζειν], people both now and at first began to philosophize, wondering first about the strange things near at hand, then going forward little by little in this way and coming to impasses [διαπορήσαντες] about greater things, such as about the attributes of the moon and things pertaining to the sun and the stars and the coming into being of the whole. But someone who wonders and is at an impasse considers himself to be ignorant [ἀγνοεῖν] (for which reason the lover of myth [φιλόμυθος] is in a certain way philosophic, since a myth is composed of wonders). So if it was by fleeing ignorance that they philosophized, it is clear that by means of knowing [τὸ εἰδέναι] they were in pursuit of knowing [τὸ ἐπίστασθαι], and not for the sake of any kind of use [χρήσεώς]. And the following testifies to the same thing: for it was when just about all the necessities [τῶν ἀναγκαίων] were present, as well as things directed toward the greatest ease and recreation [πρὸς ῥᾳστώνην καὶ διαγωγὴν], that this kind of understanding [φρόνησις] began to be sought. It is clear then that we seek it for no other use at all, but just as that human being is free [ἐλεύθερος], we say, who has his being for his own sake and not for the sake of someone else [ὁ αὑτοῦ ἕνεκα καὶ μὴ ἄλλου ὤν], so also do we seek it as being the only one of the kinds of knowledge [τῶν ἐπιστημῶν] that is free, since it alone is for its own sake." (982b12-28) [PSA: here again Aristotle opposes the necessities / τἀναγκαῖα to a way of life / διαγωγή]

"[O]ne ought not to regard anything else as more honorable [τιμιωτέραν = glorious] than this knowledge. For the most divine is also the most honorable.... All kinds of knowledge, then, are more necessary than this one, but none is better. It is necessary, however, for the possession of it to settle for us in a certain way into the opposite of the strivings with which it began." (983a4-12) [TODO: add surrounding text to provide more context]

"[O]ne must take hold of a knowledge of the causes that originate things (since that is when we say we know each thing, when we think we know its first cause), while the causes are meant in four ways, of which one is thinghood, or what it is for something to be (since the why leads back to the ultimate reasoned account [λόγος], and the first why is a cause and source), another is the material or underlying thing [τὸ ὑποκείμενον], a third is that from which the source of motion is, and the fourth is the cause opposite to that one, that for the sake of which or the good [τἀγαθόν] (since it is the completion [τέλος] of every coming-into-being and motion)...." (983a24-32) [PSA: it's unclear what Aristotle means when he says that that-for-the-sake-of-which is the opposite of that-from-which.]

"[L]earning is by means of things all or some of which are already known, whether it is by means of demonstration [ἀπόδειξις] or by way of definitions [ὀρισμός] (for it is necessary that one already know and be familiar with those things out of which the definition is made), and likewise with learning by examples [ἐπαγωγή]." (992b30-34)

"[I]t is also right to call philosophy the knowledge of truth [ἐπιστήμην τῆς ἀληθείας]. For the end [τέλος] of contemplative [θεωρητικῆς] knowledge is truth, but of practical knowledge [πρακτικῆς] it is action [ἔργον - here likely "the deed"]; for even if people devoted to the active life [οἱ πρακτικοί] do examine the way things are, they do not contemplate the cause in its own right, but in relation to [πρός] something now [νῦν = urgent]. But without the cause we do not know the truth, but each thing is what it is most of all, and more so than other things, if as a result of it the same name also belongs to those other things. (For example, fire is the hottest thing, since it is also responsible for the hotness of the other things.) Therefore also, what is responsible for the being-true of derivative things is more true than they are." (993b20-27) [PSA: here Aristotle hints that there is a certain urgency about necessities]

"[N]or can that for the sake of which go on to infinity - walking for the sake of health, this for the sake of happiness, happiness for the sake of something else, and for one thing to be the sake of another forever in this way...." (994a8-11)

"[O]ne thing comes out of another in two ways: either as a man comes into being out of a boy by his changing, or as air comes into being out of water. So the sense in which we say a man comes into being out of a boy is as what has become comes out of what is becoming, or what is complete out of what is being completed [ἐκ τοῦ ἐπιτελουμένου τὸ τετελεσμένον]." (994a22-26) [PSA: this comment might shed light on the opposition between that-for-the-sake-of-which and that-from-which]

"And since that for the sake of which something *is* is an end, and this sort of thing is what is not for the sake of anything else, but they for the sake of it, then if there is any such last thing, there will not be an infinity, but if there is no such thing, there will be nothing for the sake of which it is. But those who make there be an infinite are unaware that they abolish the nature of the good. (Yet no one would make an effort to do anything if he were not going to come to a limit [πέρας].) And there would not be intelligence [νοῦς] among beings; for what has intelligence always acts for the sake of something, and this is a limit." (994b9-14)

"It is necessary, looking toward the knowledge [ἐπιστήμη] that is being sought after, for us first to go over those things about which one must first be at an impasse [ἀπορία]. And these are all those things about these topics that some people have conceived in different ways, as well as anything apart from these that they might happen to have overlooked. And it is profitable for thsoe who want to get through something well to do a good job of giong over the impasses. For the later ease of passage [εὐπορία] is an undoing [λύσις] of the things one was earlier at an impasse about, but it is not possible to untie [λύειν] a knot [δεσμός] one is ignorant of. But the impasse in our thinking reveals this about the thing [πράγμα], for by means of that by which one is at an impasse, one suffers in much the same way as people who are tied up [τοῖς δεδεμένοις], for in both cases it is impossible to go on forward. For this reason it is necessary to have looked at all the difficulties beforehand, both on these accounts and because those who inquire without first coming to an impasse are like people who are ignorant of which way they need to walk, and on top of these things, because one never knows whether one has found the thing sought or not. For the end [τέλος] is not apparent [δῆλον] to this one, but to one who has first been at an impasse it is clear." (995a24-995b1) [PSA: those who have not first come to an impasse and thus don't know what they're seeking could be compared to the idle talkers in EN II.4]

"[T]o many beings, not all the causes belong; for in what way is a source of motion possible in motionless things, or the nature of the good, if everything that is good in itself and through its own nature is an end, and a cause in the sense that for its sake other things come into being and are, and the end and that for the sake of which is an end for some action [πρᾶξις], while all actions include motion. Therefore among motionless things there could not be this kind of source [ἀρχή], not could there be any good-itself [αὐτοαγαθόν]." (996a21-29) [PSA: αὐτοαγαθόν could also be rendered as "self-good" as opposed to non-living entities that don't have an inherent good in their life-activities or way of life.]

"[I]f there are a number of kinds of knowledge of the causes and a different one for a different source, which of these ought one to say is the one being sought, or who among those who have them is most of all a knower of the thing that is being sought? For it is possible for all the kinds of causes to belong to the same thing; for example, with a house, that from which the motion comes is the art or the builder, that for the sake of which is its work [ἔργον], the material is earth and stones, and the form is its articulation in speech [τὸ δ᾽ εἶδος ὁ λόγος]. From the distinctions made just now about what kind of knowledge is wisdom [σοφία], there is reason to apply the name to each one. For in the sense that it is the most ruling [ἀρχικωτάτη] and leading [ἡγεμονικωτάτη] and that, like slaves, it is not even fitting for the other kinds of knowledge to talk back to it, the knowledge of the end [τὸ τέλος] or the good [τἀγαθόν] (since the other things are for the sake of this), but in the sense that it was defined as being about the first causes and the most knowable thing, the knowledge of thinghood would be of that sort." (996b1-14)

"Being is meant in more than one way, but pointing toward one meaning and some one nature rather than ambiguously. And just as every healthful thing points toward health, one thing by protecting it, another by producing it, another by being a sign of health, and another because it is receptive of it, and always what is medical points toward the medical art (for one thing is called medical by having the medical art, another by being well suited to it, another by being an action belonging to the medical art, and we shall find other things spoken of in a similar way to these), so too is *being* meant in more than one way, but all of them pointing toward one source. For some things are being called beings because they are independent things, others because they are attributes of independent things, others because they are ways into thinghood, or destructions or deprivations or qualities of thinghood, or are productive or generative of independent things, or of things spoken of in relation to independent things, or negations of any of these or of thinghood, on account of which we even say that nonbeing *is* nonbeing. So just as there is one kind of knowledge of all healthful things, this is similarly the case with the other things as well. For it is not only about things meant in one way that it belongs to one kind of knowledge to contemplate them, but also about things meant in ways that point toward one nature, for these too are in a certain manner meant in one way." (1003a33-1003b15) [PSA: a similar thought process can be applied to the good; specifically, all ways of ascribing goodness might point to a root sense of the good as energeia (cf BEERE p. 329)]

"[T]hose who engage in dialectic and the sophists slip into the same outward appearance as the philosopher. For sophistry is wisdom in appearance only [ἡ γὰρ σοφιστικὴ φαινομένη μόνον σοφία ἐστί], while dialectic discourses about everything, and being is common to all things, so it is clear that they discourses about these topics just because they are proper [οἰκεῖα] to philosophy, for sophistry and dialectic turn themselves to the same class of things as philosophy, but it differs from one of them in the way its power is turned, and from the other in the choice of a way of life it makes [τῆς δὲ τοῦ βίου τῇ προαιρέσει]; dialectic is tentative about those things that philosophy seeks to know, and sophistry is a seeming [φαινομένη] without a being." (1004b17-26)

"[I]f contradictory things are all true of the same thing at the same time, it is obvious that all things will be one. For the same thing would be a battleship and a wall and a human being, if something admits of being affirmed or denied of everything, as it must be for those who repeat the saying of Protagoras. For if the human being seems to someone not to be a battleship, it is clear that he is not a battleship; and so he alsi is one, if the contradictory is true. And so the claim of Anaxagoras comes true, that all things are mixed together, so that nothing is truly any one thing. They seem, then, to be talking the indeterminate [τὸ ἀόριστον], and though supposing they are talking about what is, they are talking about what is not; for the indeterminate is that which has being potentially [δυνάμει] and not in full activity [ἐντελεχείᾳ]." (1007b18-29)

"But if everyone alike is both in the wrong and speaks the truth, it will not be possible for such a person to utter or say anything; for at the same time he says both these things and not these things. But if one conceives nothing, but alike believes and does not believe, how would he be in any different condition from plants? And from this most of all it is obvious that no one is in this condition, neither anyone else nor those stating this argument. For why does he walk to Megara and not sit still when he thinks he ought to walk? And why does he not march straight into a well in the morning, or straight over a cliff, if it happens that way, but why does he obviously take care, as though not believing that falling was both good and bad?" (1008b5-17) [PSA: here non-contradiction is not merely theoretical but practical; cf FLANNERY p. 59]

"We recognize everything on account of its form [κατὰ τὸ εἶδος ἅπαντα γιγνώσκομεν]." (1010a25)
