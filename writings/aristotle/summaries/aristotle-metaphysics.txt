"So the other animals live by images and memories, but have a small share of experience [ἐμπειρία], but the human race also lives by art and reasoning [τέχνῃ καὶ λογισμοῖς]. And for human beings, experience arises from memory, since many memories of the same thing bring to completion [ἀποτελοῦσιν] a capacity for one experience. Now experience seems to be almost the same thing as knowledge or art [ἐπιστήμη καὶ τέχνη], but for human beings, knowledge and art result from experience, for experience makes art, as Polus says and says rightly, but inexperience makes chance. And art comes into being whenever, out of many conceptions from experience, one universal judgment [ὑπόληψις] arises about those that are similar." (980b25-981a7)

"For the purposes of acting [πράττειν], experience doesn't seem to differ from art [τέχνη] at all, and we even see people with experience being more successful than those who have a rational account [λόγον ἐχόντων] without experience." (981a12-15)

"Nevertheless, we think that knowing [εἰδέναι] and understanding [ἐπαΐειν] are present in art more than is experience and we take possessors of arts to be wiser [σοφωτέρους] than people with experience, as though in every instance wisdom is more something from and following along [ἀκολουθοῦσαν] with knowing; and this is because the ones know the cause while the others do not. For people with experience know the what, but do not know the why, but the others are acquainted with the why and the cause. For this reason we also think the master craftsmen [ἀρχιτέκτονας] in each kind of work are more honorable [τιμιωτέρους = glorious] and know more than the manual laborers, and are also wiser, because they know the causes of the things they do, as though people are wiser not as a result of being skilled at action, but as a result of themselves having the reasoned account [κατὰ τὸ λόγον ἔχειν] and knowing the causes [τὰς αἰτίας γνωρίζειν]. And in general, a sign of the one who knows and the one who does not is being able to teach, and for this reason we regard the art, more than the experience, to be knowledge [ἐπιστήμη], since the ones can, but the others cannot, teach." (981a24-981b10)

"But once more arts had been discovered, and some of them were directed toward necessities [πρὸς τἀναγκαῖα] but others toward a way of living [πρὸς διαγωγὴν], it is likely that such people as were discoverers of the latter kind were always considered wiser, because their knowledge [ἐπιστήμη] was not directed toward use [πρὸς χρῆσιν]." (981b17-20) [PSA: this implies that a way of life [διαγωγή] is concerned not with useful necessities but with beautiful superfluities]

"Now it has been said in the writings on ethics what the difference is among art [τέχνη], demonstrative knowledge [ἐπιστήμη], and the other things of a similar kind, but the purpose for which we are now making this argument is that all people assume that what is called wisdom [σοφία] is concerned with first causes and origins [τὰ πρῶτα αἴτια καὶ τὰς ἀρχὰς]. Therefore, as was said above, the person with experience seems wiser than those who have any perception whatever, the artisan wiser than those with experience, the master craftsman wiser than the manual laborer, and the contemplative arts [θεωρητικαὶ] more so than the productive ones [ποιητικῶν]. It is apparent, then, that wisdom is a knowledge concerned with certain sources and causes." (981b25-982a3)

"[S]urely the skill that is suited to teach is the one that has more insight into causes [ἡ τῶν αἰτιῶν θεωρητικὴ], for those people teach who give an account of the causes [οἱ τὰς αἰτίας λέγοντες] about each things." (982a28-30)

"[T]he most ruling [ἀρχικωτάτη] of the kinds of knowledge, or the one more ruling than what is subordinate to it, is the one that knows for what purpose each thing must be done [τίνος ἕνεκέν ἐστι πρακτέον]; and this is the good [τἀγαθὸν] of each thing, and in general the best thing in the whole of nature [τὸ ἄριστον ἐν τῇ φύσει πάσῃ]. So from all the things that have been said, the name sought falls to the same kind of knowledge, for it must be a contemplation of the first sources and causes [πρώτων ἀρχῶν καὶ αἰτιῶν εἶναι θεωρητικήν], since also the good, or that for the sake of which [τὸ οὗ ἕνεκα], is one of the causes." (982b4-10)

"[B]y way of wondering [θαυμάζειν], people both now and at first began to philosophize, wondering first about the strange things near at hand, then going forward little by little in this way and coming to impasses [διαπορήσαντες] about greater things, such as about the attributes of the moon and things pertaining to the sun and the stars and the coming into being of the whole. But someone who wonders and is at an impasse considers himself to be ignorant [ἀγνοεῖν] (for which reason the lover of myth [φιλόμυθος] is in a certain way philosophic, since a myth is composed of wonders). So if it was by fleeing ignorance that they philosophized, it is clear that by means of knowing [τὸ εἰδέναι] they were in pursuit of knowing [τὸ ἐπίστασθαι], and not for the sake of any kind of use [χρήσεώς]. And the following testifies to the same thing: for it was when just about all the necessities [τῶν ἀναγκαίων] were present, as well as things directed toward the greatest ease and recreation [πρὸς ῥᾳστώνην καὶ διαγωγὴν], that this kind of understanding [φρόνησις] began to be sought. It is clear then that we seek it for no other use at all, but just as that human being is free [ἐλεύθερος], we say, who has his being for his own sake and not for the sake of someone else [ὁ αὑτοῦ ἕνεκα καὶ μὴ ἄλλου ὤν], so also do we seek it as being the only one of the kinds of knowledge [τῶν ἐπιστημῶν] that is free, since it alone is for its own sake." (982b12-28) [PSA: here again Aristotle opposes the necessities / τἀναγκαῖα to a way of life / διαγωγή]

"[O]ne ought not to regard anything else as more honorable [τιμιωτέραν = glorious] than this knowledge. For the most divine is also the most honorable.... All kinds of knowledge, then, are more necessary than this one, but none is better. It is necessary, however, for the possession of it to settle for us in a certain way into the opposite of the strivings with which it began." (983a4-12)

"[O]ne must take hold of a knowledge of the causes that originate things (since that is when we say we know each thing, when we think we know its first cause), while the causes are meant in four ways, or which one is thinghood, or what it is for something to be (since the why leads back to the ultimate reasoned account [λόγος], and the first why is a cause and source), another is the material or underlying thing [τὸ ὑποκείμενον], a third is that from which the source of motion is, and the fourth is the cause opposite to that one, that for the sake of which or the good [τἀγαθόν] (since it is the completion [τέλος] of every coming-into-being and motion)...." (983a24-32)

"[L]earning is by means of things all or some of which are already known, whether it is by means of demonstration [ἀπόδειξις] or by way of definitions [ὀρισμός] (for it is necessary that one already know and be familiar with those things out of which the definition is made), and likewise with learning by examples [ἐπαγωγή]." (992b30-34)

"[I]t is also right to call philosophy the knowledge of truth [ἐπιστήμην τῆς ἀληθείας]. For the end [τέλος] of contemplative [θεωρητικῆς] knowledge is truth, but of practical knowledge [πρακτικῆς] it is action [ἔργον - here likely "the deed"]; for even if people devoted to the active life [οἱ πρακτικοί] do examine the way things are, they do not contemplate the cause in its own right, but in relation to something now. But without the cause we do not know the truth, but each thing is what it is most of all, and more so than other things, if as a result of it the same name also belongs to those other things. (For example, fire is the hottest thing, since it is also responsible for the hotness of the other things.) Therefore also, what is responsible for the being-true of derivative things is more true than they are." (993b20-27)

"[N]or can that for the sake of which go on to infinity - walking for the sake of health, this for the sake of happiness, happiness for the sake of something else, and for one thing to be the sake of another forever in this way...." (994a8-11)

"[O]ne thing comes out of another in two ways: either as a man comes into being out of a boy by his changing, or as air comes into being out of water. So the sense in which we say a man comes into being out of a boy is as what has become comes out of what is becoming, or what is complete out of what is being completed [ἐκ τοῦ ἐπιτελουμένου τὸ τετελεσμένον]." (994a22-26)

"And since that for the sake of which something *is* is an end, and this sort of thing is what is not for the sake of anything else, but they for the sake of it, then if there is any such last thing, there will not be an infinity, but if there is no such thing, there will be nothing for the sake of which it is. But those who make there be an infinite are unaware that they abolish the nature of the good. (Yet no one would make an effort to do anything if he were not going to come to a limit [πέρας].) And there would not be intelligence [νοῦς] among beings; for what has intelligence always acts for the sake of something, and this is a limit." (994b9-14)
