Metaphysics
Aristotle
tr. Joe Sachs

[these notes are a work in progress]

"So the other animals live by images and memories, but have a small share of experience [ἐμπειρία], but the human race also lives by art and reasoning [τέχνῃ καὶ λογισμοῖς]. And for human beings, experience arises from memory, since many memories of the same thing bring to completion [ἀποτελοῦσιν] a capacity for one experience. Now experience seems to be almost the same thing as knowledge or art [ἐπιστήμη καὶ τέχνη], but for human beings, knowledge and art result from experience, for experience makes art, as Polus says and says rightly, but inexperience makes chance. And art comes into being whenever, out of many conceptions from experience, one universal judgment [ὑπόληψις] arises about those that are similar." (980b25-981a7)
