Erastai
Plato
tr. George Burges

"What then, if a man knows not the good men and the bad, would he not be ignorant whether he is good or bad, inasmuch as he too is a man? — He agreed. — Now to be ignorant of oneself, is it to be of sound mind, or not sound? — Not sound. — To know then oneself, is to be of sound mind. — I admit it, said he. — To this then, as it seems, the Delphic inscription exhorts, namely, to exercise a sound mind, and justice. — It seems so. — And by the very same science we know too how to chastise properly. — I admit it, said he. — Is not then justice that, by which we know how to chastise properly? but soundness of mind that, by which we have the skill to know ourselves and others? — It seems so, said he. — Justice then, said I, and soundness of mind are the same thing. — It appears so."
