On Civic Friendship
Sybil A. Schwarzenbach
Columbia University Press, 2009

In chapter 2 of this book, the author provides an analysis and critique of Aristotle's views on philia. Her main points are:

- The Greek word epimeleia means "care" but is rarely translated that way by Aristotle scholars. This leads to misunderstandings, because "doing with" is not the only form of shared activity: "doing for" is just as central to philia, especially in the endless kindnesses that mothers bestow on their children (note Aristotle's frequent use of the Greek verb stergein).

- Aristotle argued that equality is a precondition of philia, but Schwarzenbach counters that future equality can be a goal of philia (e.g., in the case of philia between mother and child). She also thinks (p. 47) that Aristotle was attached to the idea that not only equality of arete is important, but also equality of status, wealth, power, age, etc.; by contrast, she counters that these are not necessary for philia to blossom. It seems to me that she might underestimate the role that such factors play in the reality of human relationships (e.g., she mentions the possibility that a young American boy could form a close friendship with an old African woman, but such relationships are extremely uncommon).

- She legitimately points out that Aristotle's account (and, following him, modern accounts) of friendship are rife with sexism, leading to an ideal of "fraternity" between adult men but no other kinds of philia.

- Most generally, she describes the goal of bringing another person into being through philia as a kind of "ethical reproduction" and argues that this activity is the underlying, self-interested goal of shared activity and living together.
