Aristotle on Eudaimonia, Nous, and Divinity
A.A. Long
In Miller, ed., Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics: A Critical Guide
Cambridge, 2011

"[T]he godlikeness and happiness human beings can achieve by engaging in contemplative activity is quite compatible with their achieving a lesser degree of godlikeness and happiness through performing morally excellent activities. For sure, the gods do not engage in such actions (1178b10-18). But it does not follow from the gods' exclusively intellectual excellence that the happiness human beings achieve by morally virtuous activities has nothing godlike about it. In achieving happiness thereby, there should be something godlike about their condition, given the general sense of eudaimonia and Aristotle's understanding of the term." (LONG, pp. 97-98)

Commenting on NE X.7 1177a12-18, Long says: "I call particular attention to his specifying our divine nous ... as both 'our natural rule and guide' and the instrument of our thinking 'things noble and divine.' The roles attributed here to nous are both 'practical' and 'theoretical.'" (LONG, p. 110)
