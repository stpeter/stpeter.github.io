Parts of Animals
Aristotle
tr. W. Ogle

"Every study [θεωρία] and investigation [μέθοδος], the humblest and the noblest [τιμιωτέρα = glorious] alike, seems to admit of two kinds of proficiency [ἔχεις], one of which may be properly called educated knowledge [ἐπιστήμη] of the subject, while the other is a kind of acquaintance [παιδεία] with it. For any of educated man should be able to form a fair judgement as to the goodness or badness of an exposition [λόγος]. To be educated is in fact to be able to do this; and the man of general education we take to be such." (639a1-8)

"Plainly, however, that cause is the first which we call that for the sake of which. For this is the account [λόγος] of the thing, and the account forms the starting-point [ἀρχή], alike in the works of art and in the works of nature. For the doctor and the builder define health or house, either by the intellect [διάνοια] or by perception [αἴσθησις], and then proceed to give the accounts and the causes of each of the things they do and of why they should do it thus. Now in the works of nature the good [τὸ καλόν] and that for the sake of which is still more dominant than in works of art, nor is necessity a factor with the same significance in them all; though almost all writers try to refer their accounts to this, failing to distinguish the several ways in which necessity is spoken of. For there is absolute necessity, manifested in eternal phenomena; and there is hypothetical necessity, manifested in everything that is generated as in everything that is produced by art, be it a house or what it may. For if a house or other such final object is to be realized, it is necessary that first this and then that shall be produced and set in motion, and so on in continuous succession, until the end is reached, for the sake of which each prior thing is produced and exists. So also is it with the productions of nature. The mode of necessity, however, and the mode of demonstration [ἀπόδειξις] are different in natural science from they are in the theoretical sciences (we have spoken of this elsewhere). For in the latter the starting-point is that which is; in the former that which is to be. For since health, or a man, is of such and such a character, it is necessary for this or that to exist or be produced...." (639b14-640a5)

"The fittest mode, then, of treatment is to say, a man has such and such parts, because the essence of man is such and such, and because they are necessary conditions of his existence, or, if we cannot quite say this then the next thing to it, namely, that it is either quite impossible for a man to exist without them, or, at any rate, that it is good [καλῶς] that they should be there. And this follows: because man is such and such the process of his development is necessarily such as it is; and therefore this part is formed first, that next; and after a like fashion should we explain the generation of all other works of nature." (640a33-640b4)

"What are the forces by which the hand or the body was fashioned into its shape? The woodcarver will perhaps say, by the ax or the auger; the physiologist, by air and by earth. Of these two answers the woodcarvver's is the better. For it is not enough for him to say that by the stroke of his tool this part was formed into a concacity, that into a flat surface; but he must state the reasons why [διότι] he struck his blow in such a way as to effect this, and for the sake of what he did so; namely, that the piece of wood should develop eventually into this or that shape." (641a5-14)

"For order [τεταγμένον] and definiteness [ὠρισμένον] are much more plainly manifest in the celestial bodies than in our own frame; while change and chance are rather characteristic of the perishable things of earth." (641b18-20)

"[W]henever there is plainly some final end [τέλος], to which a motion tends should nothing stand in the way, we always say that the one is for the sake of the other; and from this it is evident that there must be something of the kind, corresponding to what we call nature." (641b23-26)

"This third mode is what may be called hypothetical necessity. For if a piece of wood is to be split with an axe, the axe must of necessity be hard; and, if hard, must of necessity be made of bronze or iton. Now exactly in the same way the body, since it is an instrument - for both the body as a whole and its several parts individually are for the sake of something - if it is to do its work, must of necessity be of such and such a character, and made such and such materials." (642a9-13)

"The scanty conceptions to which we can attain of celestial things give us, from their excellence [τιμιότητα], more pleasure than all our knowledge of the world in which we live; just as a half glimpse of persons that we love is more delightful than an accurate view of other things, whatever their number and dimensions. On the other hand, in certitude and in completeness our knowledge of terrestrial things has the advantage. Moreover, their greater nearness and affinity to us balances somewhat the loftier interest of heavenly things that are the objects of the higher philosophy [τὰ θεῖα φιλοσοφίαν]. Having already treated of the celestial world, as far as our conjectures could reach, we proceed to treat of animals, without omitting, to the best of our ability, any member of the kingdom, however ignoble [μήτε ἀτιμότερον μήτε τιμιώτερον]. For if some have no graces to charm the sense, yet nature, which fashioned them, gives amazing pleasure in their study [θεωρία] to all who can trace links of causation, and are inclined to philosophy. Indeed, it would be strange if mimic representations of them were attractive, because they disclose the mimetic skill of the painter or sculptor, and the original realities themselves were not more interesting, to all at any rate who have eyes to discern the causes. We therefore must not recoil with childish aversion from the examination of the humbler [ἀτιμοτέραν] animals. Every realm of nature is marvellous [θαυμαστόν], and as Heraclitus, when the strangers who came to visit him found him warming himself at the furnace in the kitchen and hesitated to go in, is reported to have bidden them not to be afraid to enter, as even in that kitchen divinities were present, so we should venture on the study of every kind of animal without distaste; for each and all will reveal to us something natural and something beautiful [καλά]. Absence of haphazard and conduciveness of everything to an end are to be found in nature's works in the highest degree, and the end for which those works are put together and produced is a form of the beautiful [τὴν τοῦ καλοῦ χώραν]." (644b31-645a26)
