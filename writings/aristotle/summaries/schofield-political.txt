Aristotle's Political Ethics

"The NE makes it clear that the self-sufficiency of the good life - its success in satisfying our aspirations - is something primarily in our own hands: a matter of virtuous *activity*. That is what makes it *self*-sufficient. And that is why Aristotle thinks that the highest form of activity, philosophical reflection, is the most self-sufficient: because satisfying our potential for it is less dependent on anything external to reflection than is the case of any other activity (NE X.7 1177a27-b1). But a *life* devoted exclusively to reflection 'would be above the human plan' (1177b26-27). 'Insofar as he is a human being, and shares his life with others, he chooses to do what accords with virtue. So he will be in need of things external to himself if he is to live his humanity' (NE X.8 1178b5-7)." (SCHOFIELD, p. 312)

"We know from Aristotle's analysis of self-sufficiency in Book I that he would regard a conception of *my* good that treats me as a unit isolable from my fellow citizens and their interests, and for that reason not needing to get involved in politics, as reflecting a radically mistaken understanding of human nature." (SCHOFIELD, p. 320)
