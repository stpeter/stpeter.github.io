Confronting Aristotle's Ethics: Ancient and Modern Morality
Eugene Garver
University of Chicago Press, 2006

"[T]he Ethics revolves around the idea that the abilities that let us choose actions that are their own end are precisely the abilities that bring the soul into the best condition. To elaborate the point a little more slowly: of the actions that produce valuable results, there are some which we value for their own sake. These, for Aristotle's project to make sense, must coincide with the exercise of powers that have brought the soul into the best possible shape. That coincidence of the two dimensions of goodness is the radical thesis that lies at the center of the Ethics. Aristotle's great gamble is that being good and doing good coincide." (pp. 4-5)

"The Ethics is a meditation on how to lead an active life. It locates human beings and human goods in a world made up of activities and the potentialities that make those activities possible. to be is to be active. We realize our nature by being as active as possible. Effective human action embodies the metaphysical urge to convert incomplete processes into complete activities, a metaphysical imperative Aristotle calls the love for the noble.... The key elements of the good life, virtue, happiness, choice, praxis, all need to be understood as activities.... What I see as the crux of the Ethics, the identity between a person being good and doing good, is the identity of the best human activities considered as the realization of the soul - energeia as the perfection of a dunamis - and the best activities considered as securing the most desirable goods - energeia as the perfection of kinesis." (pp. 7-8)

"Aristotle exhibits the same pattern of thought, the same drive to see the autonomous values in the world, throughout his range of inquiry. We will be more faithful to Aristotle's own way of thinking if we concentrate not on energeia as a term but on perfection, completion, realization, actualization as patterns enacted in Aristotle's inquiries. In the Rhetoric we see it in the definition of rhetoric. In the Ethics, we see it in actions that are chosen for their own sake. In the Politics, we see it in the self-sufficient community that aims at living well, in the Physics in the definition of nature as an internal principle of motion, and in the De Anima in the definition of soul as the first activity (energeia) of an organic body." (p. 8)

"Instead of presenting a contest between the active and contemplative lives, Aristotle shows how the philosophical life completes and political and practical life. The philosophical life is not an alternative to the practical life but its fulfillment. It is the good person, and not the theologian, who truly understands the assertion that people are not the best thing in the universe (NE VI.7 1141a20-21), because only the good person can understand and act on that thesis as a practical truth." (p. 12)

Garver makes an argument by analogy between rhetoric and ethics, specifically by introducing the concept of an internal end. "Aristotle limits the available *means* to argument and thereby constructs a new, internal *end* for the art of rhetoric. Here is the first surprising conclusion to draw from the Rhetoric to apply to the Ethics: internal ends emerge out of *limiting* the *available means* for achieving a given, external end.... the internal *ends* of actions chosen for their own sake emerge out of *limitations* of the available *means* for achieving given, external ends.... Nothing can have a function, an ergon, without these two ends.... the only way to aim *rationally* at external ends is through commitment to the internal ends that are properly associated with them. In other words, when we have an internal end, we "aim" at it rationally as we aim to gain mastery of the practice it involves. In that way we do all we can to secure the external end. Practices - using that term as to include everything in the Ethics' first sentence - must have internal ends to be rational." (p. 20) However, I note that for Aristotle eudaimonia is not in fact an external end.

"Aristotle sees a difference between artful and sophistic *practice*, based on the difference between finding the available means of persuasion and simply aiming at persuading. Better rhetoric is more rational rhetoric. The same holds in ethics. There too it will be fatal to find morality in the ends of action and rationality in the means. There too the end internal tothe practice of virtue will be the source of both morality and rationality. Acting well consists in concentrating on internal ends, acting for the noble (e.g., NE III.7.1115b13, III.12.1119b16, IV.1.1120a24, 1122b6-7, EE III.1.1229a4, 1230a26-33).... 'Sophistry is not a matter of ability (dynamis) but of deliberate decision (prohairesis)' (Rh I.1.1355b17-18; see 1371a6-8, top I.1.100a19-101a4, NE II.2.1103a5, IV.7.1127b9-20).... By contrast, Aristotle's rhetorician ... *wants* to persuade, but *aims at* finding the available means of persuasion." (pp. 24-25) I'm not persuaded by this argument, because it seems that sophists are quite adept at finding the available means of persuasion, it's just that in their willingness to do anything to persuade they lack a commitment to wisdom.

"An end is rational in proportion as pursuing it is an activity. Exercising reason is a human being's way of being active and fully human (NE I.7.1098a7, I.13.1102b31-1103a1, IX.9.1170a29-37). Our desire to achieve some good becomes complete by being realized in activities that are their own end." (p. 31)

"While virtue takes more than knowledge, the virtues are *more rational* than the arts. The virtuous person, unlike the rhetorician or other artisan, knows himself (NE II.2.1103b26-31). He knows himself as an agent, as the cause which connects the ultimate principles with ultimate things to be done (NE III.3.1112b31-32, VI.2.1139b4-5, IX.9.1168b28-33, DA 433b28, Met VI.1.1025b18-28, XI.1064a10-11, EE II.6.1223a5). When our internal goods are objects of decision, knowing them we know ourselves. 'Every activity aims at the end that corresponds to the habit of which it is the manifestation. So it is with the activity of the courageous man: his courage is noble; therefore its end is nobility, for a thing is defined by its end' (NE III.7.1115b20-22; see too III.7.1115b23-24, III.9.1117b7-9, IV.2.1122b6-7)." (p. 32)

"Ethical knowledge is knowledge of the self as the locus of good. (NE.2.1103b26-31, X.9.1179a33-b12). The agent is identified with his ends: a person's ends reveal his ethos and who he is (NE III.2.1111b4-6, III.4.1113a21-22, IX.5.1166a13-17, EE II.10.1226a11-13, II.11.1227b34-1228a4, Rh I.9.1367b21-27)." (p. 33)

"To live well, one must practice the metaphysical truths that the basic substances in the world are defined by their activities, that activities are complete motions and complete realizations of our psychic powers. Living well means organizing one's life around the perfect energeiai listed at Metaphysics IX.6.1048b23-25 - seeing, understanding, thinking, living well, and being happy." (p. 34)

"Vicious people aim at pleasure because they can't aim at anything good in itself. Thinking that external goods are the only goods, one becomes a pleasure maximizer by default. Ignorance of the noble has the pursuit of pleasure as a consequence, since all goods that are not goods of activity and agency are pursued as pleasures. If I aim at wealth, fame, or political power, they are good because they please me. But when I desire something because I think it is good, rather than think it good because I want it, I want to *do* something about it. To think something good I have to care about how I get it, and in particular want it to be a function of my actions and decisions instead of luck or of the favor of another (NE I.9.1099b20-25; see Top III.3.118b8-10, Pol VII.1.1323b23-33, VII.13.1332a28-36)." (p. 41)

"The vicious person believes that because something is good he should have it. The virtuous person thinks that because something is good he should *do* it. Therefore, too, the vicious person can only want apparent goods, not real goods, since true goods are goods of activity." (p. 41)

Quoting Aristotle: "'The absolutely good is absolutely desirable but what is good for oneself is desirable for oneself; and the two ought to come into agreement.... When there is discord between them, a man is not yet perfectly good; for it is possible for unrestraint to be engendered in him, as unrestraint is caused by discord between the good and the pleasant in the emotions.' (EE VII.2.1236b39-1237a3)" (p. 42)

"The confrontation of the virtues with the ultimate individual is built into the virtue itself (NE VI.7.1141b14-16, VI.8.1142a11-15, 1142a23-25, VI.11.114332-35). The clever person will give money to some individual as a member of a class.... but the object of liberality is an individual. 'Having the right feelings at the right times, about the right things, toward the right people, for the right end, and in the right way, is the mean and best condition, and this is proper to virtue' (NE II.6.1106b21-23; see IV.5.1125b33-1126a1)." (p. 45)

"Ethical virtues... incorporate decision into themselves, integrating rationality and goodness. They are habits of deciding, hexeis prohairetike (NE II.6.1106a36-1107a2). Since the virtues are already governed by deliberative desire and desiring reason (NE VI.2.1139a23-35, 1139b5-6), they don't need an external desire or decision.... Because the virtues incorporate decision into themselves, they are modes of practical rationality that are not teachable, are not powers for opposites, and do not exclude emotion." (p. 50)

"Hexeis ... lead ot activities that are their own end because the hexeis themselves are, considered as dunameis, complete. Complete activities can only the the realization of such complete potencies. Only because virtuous *habits* are their own good, desirable in themselves, are virtuous *actions* their own good. Actions that are their own end can only be the realization of such good potencies." (p. 60)

"The virtues bring the soul into good condition and in that way they are complete in themselves. Because the relation of soul to virtue is perfect - the soul is fully realized, fully active, in being virtuous - so too is the relation of virtuous habit to virtuous act perfect. The transition from virtuous habit to virtuous action has a completeness that other realizations lack." (p. 62)

"We can now choose to make a living at a craft. Indeed, the very expression, "making a living," is so unintelligible to Aristotle that our ease in understanding it shows our distance from Aristotle's world. It is one thing for ethics to neglect techne; it is another for ethics to be confronted with a regime of techne in competition with it.... While Aristotle seems to us blind to the possibilities of highly ethical virtues being developed and expressed through the practice of a craft, he was very alert to the possibility that the more people's lives are organized around technai, the more ethics becomes a matter for one's private, nonpolitical life." (p. 85)

"The denigration of techne is one of thsoe features of Aristotle's thought I mentioned at the beginning as both attractive and repellent. It is attractive because it follows from his strict separation of praxis from poiesis, doing from making, a separation essential to carving out a special place for ethical virtue and for hte idea of doing something for the sake of the noble. Equally, it is repellent because it blinds Aristotle to the important human capacity to find challenge and satisfaction in a diversity of (nonpolitical) activities. The contempt Aristotle expresses for techne and for artisans is not a bubbling up for nonphilosophical class prejudices against trade or money. It is central to his developing the autonomy of praxis." (p. 87)

"Benjamin Constant in "The Liberty of the Ancients Compared with that of the Moderns" (1819) ... argues that courage is no longer functional: "As age must come in which commerce replaces war. We have reached that age." The polis has been replaced by the state, and so courage must be replaced by the virtues of commerce, a long distance from Aristotle's claims that the mechanical and mercantile lives are inimical to virtue (Pol VII.8.1328b39-41), or the remark in the Laws (705a) that commerce 'fills the land with wholesaling and retailing, breeds shifty and deceitful habits in a man's soul and makes the citizens distrustful and hostile.' The marketplace replaces the battlefield as the school for citizenship. There we acquire the virtues of probity, of satifying others, of discipline, self-control, and self-sacrifice in entirely new forms. The virtues of commerce are not only part of flourishing for the new individual, but are central to his identity as a member of the new state, as a producer and consumer. 'Commerce inspires in men,' Constant writes, 'a vivid love of individual independence. Commerce supplies their needs, satisfied their desires, without the intervention of authorities.'" (p. 91)

"Phronesis has to be very different in contemporary circumstances, because it cannot be simply the orthos logos of the ethical virtues. It has jobs to do unimagined by Aristotle, because of the relation  between virtue and techne and the increased role of techne in our lives. It is common to distinguish a slave society from a society with slaves. Similarly one can distinguish a technical or technological society from a society that contains technai. Aristotle's conceptions of ethical virtue, phronesis, and the good life make sense only within a nontechnological society, a society in which man's political nature is central. Living well requires a different kind of practical rationality when must negotiate a world dominated by techne." (p. 92). For the record, I disagree.
