Posterior Analytics
Aristotle
tr. Jonathan Barnes

"That the deduction [sullogismos] must depend on necessities is evident from this too: if, when there is a demonstration, a man who has not got an account [me echon logon] of the reason why [apodeixis] does not have an understanding [episteme]." (74b26-28)
