Phainomena as Witnesses and Examples: The Methodology of Eudemian Ethics 1.6
Joseph Karbowski
Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy 49:196-226 (2015)

"[W]hereas the Eudemian method aims to discover explanatory definitions of ethical topics by constructing complex deductive arguments which draw on the phainomena for support and illustration, the endoxic method seeks truth about ethical matters by purging endoxa of their epistemic shortcomings via aporetic investigation." (KARBOWSKI, p. 196)
