The Ergon Inference

"If the foregoing is correct, Aristotle would be saying that in order to identify a good F (or the goodness for Fs) two logically distinguishable steps must be taken: first, the ergon of Fs has to be ascertained in a non-evaluative manner, and then, an evaluative judgement as to what counts as a good performance of that ergon has to be passed. This latter judgement is equivalent to finding the arete or aretai corresponding specifically to the class of Fs. The ergon and the good are thus not strictly identical." (GOMEZ-LOBO, p. 48)

With regard to the phrase "activity and actions meta logou" (EN VI.13 1144b26-27), Gómez-Lobo thinks that "What Aristotle has in mind are simply actions, right or wrong, which be so precisely because they are accompanied by a logos or awareness of a propositional account of some sort which can be affirmed or denied by the agent. Needless to say, these are the actions in which only humans can engage. They constitute our characteristic activity." (GOMEZ-LOBO, p. 51)
