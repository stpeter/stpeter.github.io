Dialectic, Motion, and Perception
Charlotte Witt
In Nussbaum and Rorty, eds., Essays on Aristotle's De Anima. Clarendon, 1992.

Citing Metaphysics 995a27-b4, Witt states: "The purpose of the critical phase of dialetic is twofold: it offers a glimpse of the end or goal of the investigation just as teh negative of a photograph outlines a positive image, and it also helps one decide which theory is adequate or most adequate in relation to the array of puzzles and problems." (WITT, p. 171)
