Euthyphro
Plato
tr. Benjamin Jowett

"SOCRATES:

And does piety or holiness, which has been defined to be the art of attending to the gods, benefit or improve them? Would you say that when you do a holy act you make any of the gods better?

EUTHYPHRO:

No, no; that was certainly not what I meant.

SOCRATES:

And I, Euthyphro, never supposed that you did. I asked you the question about the nature of the attention, because I thought that you did not.

EUTHYPHRO:

You do me justice, Socrates; that is not the sort of attention which I mean.

SOCRATES:

Good: but I must still ask what is this attention to the gods which is called piety?

EUTHYPHRO:

It is such, Socrates, as servants show to their masters.

SOCRATES:

I understand â€” a sort of ministration to the gods.

EUTHYPHRO:

Exactly." (13c-d)

"SOCRATES:

Upon this view, then, piety is a science of asking and giving?

EUTHYPHRO:

You understand me capitally, Socrates.

SOCRATES:

Yes, my friend; the reason is that I am a votary of your science, and give my mind to it, and therefore nothing which you say will be thrown away upon me. Please then to tell me, what is the nature of this service to the gods? Do you mean that we prefer requests and give gifts to them?

EUTHYPHRO:

Yes, I do.

SOCRATES:

Is not the right way of asking to ask of them what we want?

EUTHYPHRO:

Certainly." (14d-e)
