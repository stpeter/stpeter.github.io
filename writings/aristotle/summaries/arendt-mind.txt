"Aristotle's De Anima is full of tantalizing hints at psychic phenomena and their close interconnection with the body in contrast with the relation or, rather, non-relation between body and mind. Discussing these matters in a rather tentative and uncharacteristic way, Aristotle declares: "... there sees to be no case in which the soul can act or be acted upon without the body, e.g., anger, courage, appetite, and sensation generally. To be active without involving the body seems rather a property of the mind [noein]. But if the mind [noein] too proves to be some imagination [phantasia] or impossible without imagination, it [noein] too could not be without the body." (DA 403a5-10) And somewhat later, summing up: "Nothing is evident about the mind [nous] and the theoretical faculty, but it seems to be a different kind of soul, and only this kind can be separated [from the body], as what is eternal from what is perishable." (DA 413b24ff) And in one of the biological treatises he suggests that the soul - its vegetative as well as its nutritive and sensitive part - "came into being in the embryo without existing previously outside it, but the nous entered the soul from outside, thus granting to man a kind of activity which had no connection with the activities of the body." (GA 736b5-29) In other words, there are no sensations corresponding to mental activities; and the sensations of the psyche, of the soul, are actually feelings we sense with our bodily organs." (ARENDT-1977a, pp. 33-34)

"The test applying to the hypocrite is indeed the old Socratic 'Be as you wish to appear,' which means appear *always* as you wish to appear to others even if it happens that you are alone and appear to no one but yourself. When I make such a decision [PSA: prohairesis = commitment], I am not merely reacting to whatever qualities may be given me; I am making an act of deliberate choice among the various potentialities of conduct with which the world has presented me. Out of such acts arises finally what we call character or personality, the conglomeration of a number of identifiable qualities gathered together into a comprehensible and reliably identifiable whole, and imprinted, as it were, on an unchangeable substratum of gifts and defects peculiar to our soul and body structure." (ARENDT-1977a, p. 37)

With regard to "Kant's 'professional thinkers'", she writes: "These we call philosophers, and their way of life will always be 'the life of a stranger' (bios xenikos), as Aristotle called it in the Politics. (Politics 1324a16)" (ARENDT-1977a, p. 53)

"[T]he Greeks had some reason for their 'prejudice' against the infinite. (Plato discovered that everything permitting of a comparative is by nature unlimited, and limitlessness was to him as to all Greeks the cause of all evils. (Philebus 25-26) Hence, his great confidence in number and measurement: it sets limits on what of itself [pleasure, for instance] 'does not and never will contain and derive from itself either beginning [arche] or middle or end [telos].' (Philebus 31a)" (ARENDT-1977a, p. 56)

"I called these mental activities basic because they are autonomous; each of them obeys the laws inherent in the activity itself, although all of them depend on a certain stillness of the soul's passions, on that 'dispassionate quiet' ('ledenschaftslose Stille') which Hegel ascribed to 'merely thinking cognition'." (ARENDT-1977a, p. 70). [PSA: Note the connection to stillness / ἠρεμία in Aristotle.]

"The mind's faculty of making present what is absent is of course by no means restricted to mental images of absent objects; memory quite generally stores, and holds at the disposition of recollection, whatever is no more, and the will anticipates what the future may bring but is not yet. [PSA: Cf DA 433b5ff] Only because of the mind's capacity for making present what is absent can we say "no more" and constitute a past for ourselves, or say "not yet" and get ready for a future. [PSA: This one sense of hexis as readiness.] But this is possible for the mind only after it has withdrawn from the present and the urgencies of everyday life. Thus, in order to will, the mind must withdraw from the immediacy of desire [PSA: epithumia?], which, without reflecting and without reflexivity, stretches out [PSA: oregetai] its hand to get hold of the desired object; for the will is not concerned with objects but with projects, for instance, with the future availability of an object that it may or may not desire in the present. The will [PSA: boulesis?] transforms the desire into an intention [PSA: prohairesis?]." (ARENDT-1977a, p. 76)

"The 'true philosopher,' one who spends his whole life in thought, has two desires: first, that he may be free from all kinds of business and especially be rid of his body, which always demands to be taken care of, 'fall in our way at every step ... and causes confusion and trouble and panic,' (Phaedo 66) and second, that he may come to live in a hereafter where those things with which thinking is concerned, such as truth, justice, and beauty, will be no less accessible and real than what now can be perceived with the bodily senses. (Phaedo 65) Even Aristotle, in one of his popular writings, reminds his readers of those 'islands of the blessed' that are blessed because there 'men would not need anything and none of the other things could be of any use to them so that only thinking and contemplation (theorein) would be left, that is, what even now we call a free life.' [Protrepticus B43]" (ARENDT-1977a, p. 84)
