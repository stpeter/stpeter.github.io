What Is Ancient Philosophy?
Pierre Hadot
Harvard, 2002

"How should we conceive this life according to the mind? Should we follow Ingemar DÃ¼ring, and define it as the life of a scholar? If we consider the activities which were honored in Aristotle's school, it is evident that philosophical life there had the features of what we would call a great scientific undertaking." (HADOT, pp. 81-82)

"To understand discourse, the auditor must first have had some experience with what the discourse is about, and some degree of familiarity with its object. Slow assimilation is then required, capable of creating within the soul a permanent disposition, or habitus: 'Those who have begun to learn link words together but do not yet know their meaning; for the words must be integral parts of our nature [word for word: they must grow with us]. But this takes time.' (EN VI 1147a21-22) Just as it had been for Plato, so for Aristotle true knowledge is born only from long familiarity with concepts and methods, and also with observed facts. We must have lengthy experience with things in order to know them, and to familiarize ourselves with the the general laws of nature, as well as with the processes and rational necessities of the intellect. Without this personal effort, the auditor cannot assimilate discourse; it will remain useless to him." (HADOT, pp. 88-89)
