Aristotle on the Sense of Touch
Cynthia Freeland
In Nussbaum and Rorty, eds., Essays on Aristotle's De Anima. 
Clarendon, 1992.

"Each sense is held to be 'a sort of mean' between extremes (424a4-5); more precisely, neither the sense nor the sense-organ is a 'magnitude' (megethos), but rather 'a certain form or power in a magnitude' (alla logos tis kai dunamis ekeinou; 424a26-28)." (FREELAND-1992, p. 231) [PSA: is there an analogy here to arete?]
