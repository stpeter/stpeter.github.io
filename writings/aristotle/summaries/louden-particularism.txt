Aristotle's Practical Particularism

"Aristotle does note in several places that phronesis is much more than a life experience that correctly grasps particulars. It is, in addition, an architectonic knowledge of the good life for individuals as well as for households and communities, and is described at the beginning of the EN as 'the most authoritative [kuriotates) and most comprehensive [architektonikes]' science (1094a26-27; for VI.8). This organizing knowledge of the good life is something which the mere man of experience lacks." (LOUDEN, p. 172)
