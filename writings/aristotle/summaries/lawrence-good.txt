Human Good and Human Function

"The ordinary view is that what matters most in life is money, power, and status, or one's beauty and health, and that ethical respectability is a nice extra (Politics VII.1 1323a25-27, 1323a34-38). Aristotle takes this view to put values or goods upside down. What matters most is one's soul - being a person of a certain sort, with correct values.... However ... the end of life is not becoming a good human, one with all the correct values.... It is rather a matter of realizing those values, or excellences, in actually living well, over a full life-time. In effect, Aristotle takes the synonymy of eudaimonia with euzoia, living well, very seriously. And this in two respects: eudaimonia is primarily a matter of a good of soul or life, and the sense of life at issue is *exercise* of life-faculty." (LAWRENCE-2006, pp. 52-53)

"For us, the distinctive way of being alive is properly rational action (feeling and thought) - praxis: that is, proper human living exhibits rational choice, and the excellences of such choice. It is this that differentiates us from other living things. In effect, Aristotle takes the synonymy of eudaimonia and eupraxia very seriously." (LAWRENCE-2006, p. 53)

"[W]e have inevitable human needs - physical, emotional, and social - so that, even in optimal circumstances, it will sometimes be best to address these, and not best to contemplate (cf. NE X.8 1178b3-7). But that it is out of our reach does not mean it should not function as a regulative ideal." (LAWRENCE-2006, p. 63)

"[P]ractical reason has a productive aspect: it looks to determine and bring about an end thatis not simply its own activity - it looks by its own nature beyond itself.... As productive in this way its activities are relatively un-final (cf. EN X.7 1177b1-4, 1177b18) and unsuited to occupy free time (1177b4-15, 1177b17-18: 'unleisurely')." (LAWRENCE-2006, p. 65)

"The Politics, which makes 'free time' the 'single arche of all things' (VIII.3 1337b32), offers at least four criteria for an activity's being appropriate to occupy free time: it must be (1) seriously good (spoudaios), not trivial; (2) final, and not merely recuperative or relaxing (VII.5 1339a26-31); (3) noble, and not merely necessary (VIII.3 1338a14, 1338a30-22 [sic]); and (4) worthy of a free person's engaging in, and not useful (1338a15, 1338a30-22 [sic])." (LAWRENCE-2006, p. 65) [PSA: the Greek concept of scholia is not quite the same as our concept of free time.]

"It is free time that we need to supply to citizens and ourselves as individuals; and we need to have some idea of the sort of activities that properly fill it (Politics VIII.3 1337b33-35); and to provide, and be provided with, the proper education to equip us to engage in such activities. Echoing Plato's Laws, Aristotle criticizes the Spartans for failing in this critical aspect of education: 'That is why the Spartans were preserved while they made war, but when they ruled, perished, because they did not understand how to occupy free time [scholazein], and never engaged in any other kind of training [askesis] more fundamental [kuriotera] than military [polemike]" (Politics II.9 1271b3-6; cf. VII.14 1333b5-133a10 etc.)." (LAWRENCE-2006, p. 68)

"The Politics, simply by putting the focus on the idea of free time, sets us several themes for further investigation: (a) the notion of free time itself (for surely bringing up children should not be excluded); (b) the temptation to a constraint view of morality which is not quite right (especially if all our fully rational actions are practical ones); (c) the possibility of wasting one's life - frittering it away on trivia - and the need to do something with it, to make something of it, which leads into the neglected topic of distinguishing the serious and deep from the light-minded and trivial; and (d) the need for appropriate education to equip one to fill free time fruitfully." (LAWRENCE-2006, pp. 71-72)
