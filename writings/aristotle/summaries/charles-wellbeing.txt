"[T]heoria and practical wisdom will be analogically related if and only if theoria plays a role in its domain like that of pratical wisdom in its. It is not hard to find an Aristotelian analogy of the relevant type between theoretical and practical wisdom. Theoria is the excellent exercise of a given rational capacity. Its exercise consists in grasping eternal truths, making them part of oneself, reasoning about them in a given way. Its exercise is choiceworthy for its own sake. Practical wisdom is also the excellent exercise of a rational capacity, whose exercise consists in grasping truths, making them part of oneself, reasoning about them in a given way. Its exercise is choiceworthy for its own sake. Thus, while theoria and practical wisdom operate in different areas and according to somewhat different principles, they are analogous." (CHARLES-2, pp. 216-217)

"The crucial phrase in this passage [1178a5-8] is 'what man is most of all.' For the term 'malista' points to a feature which man is more than anything else. [fn8: For this use of 'malista' see (eg) N.E. 1124a12, HA 518b4ff, Pol 1278b23ff. It can be compared with the phrase 'liking most' (NE 1179a27). Its use marks a retreat from the earlier supposition that 'one might even think that man was identical with nous' (1178a2ff).] But this essentially comparative notion allows that man may be other things as well as intellect, provided that none of them is more distinctive of him than his intellect. So understood, Aristotle is not asserting the identity of man and his intellect alone. Rather he is claiming that intellect is what is especially distinctive of man, the highest of several features in his essence. But this claim is fully consistent with his nature having other ingredients as well as theoretical nous, related to the latter (e.g.) by analogy. Thus, practical nous may be a part of man's nature, provided that it is an analogue of theoretical nous (see 1143a35-b3, 1142a25ff). But the former brings with it as essential features of our nature ethical virtue and the emotions (1178a19-21). So understood, 1178a5-8 endorses rather than rejects [15 = we are not identical with our intellects alone]." (CHARLES-2, p. 220) ...
