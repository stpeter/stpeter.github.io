Aristotle on the Irreducible Senses of the Good
Jurgis Brakas
History of Philosophy & Logical Analysis 6 (1):23-74 (2003)

After describing what he calls the purification process involved in dialectic, Brakas argues that "[a]s a result of the purification process, we will also have to remove any difficulties presented by the observational data.... Aristotle's inquiry into akrasia ... illustrates this procedure. There he rejects the view held by Socrates on akrasia ... by appealing to the observed facts: 'Now, this view manifestly clashes with what we observe to be the case [fn101 cites 1145b26-28].... bringing the observational data to bear on the endoxa seems to be a process of determining whether the endoxa satisfy a consciously held criterion for surviving the purification process.... Aristotle seems to imply as much near the end of the NE, after having presented his view of eudaimonia in detail: '... the truth in practical matters is discerned from deeds and the course of life; for the supreme authority [lies] in these. So we must examine what we have already said by bringing it to the test of deeds and the course of life, and if it is in accord with our deeds, we must accept [it], but if it conflicts with [them], we must take it to be [mere] words.' [fn104: 1179a16-22. Note also NE A3: 1095a1-4 and B7: 1107a28-32]" (pp. 46-47)
