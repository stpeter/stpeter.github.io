Technology and the Virtues
Shannon Vallor
Oxford, 2016

[NOTE: Although this book is not about Aristotle, several of Vallor's Aristotle-inspired forumlations are relevant to my project...]

"[T]he complete human is not perfected; rather, he is complete in that the whole of his *actual* being - his beliefs, attitudes, values, desires, feelings, and even physical movements - is at last engaged in teh effort of becoming his ideal self." (VALLOR, p. 94)

"[T]he ability to extend moral concern in a virtuous manner marks a certain kind of completion of the moral self; not a *perfection* of the self, in the sense of having no more work to do, but a completion in teh sense that every active moral potential of a person has been directed toward the project of self-cultivation. In this sense, the completion of the moral self may be thought of as the closing of an endless circle that now runs with increasingly less resistance, since no active element of one's intellect, affect, or desire naturally impedes it." (VALLOR, p. 111) [PSA: note the connection between extending moral concern and the 'complete virtue' of justice as explained in FOSSHEIM 2011; also the relevance of internal states to Aristotle's formulation 'if nothing impedes']
