Aristotle's Use of Division and Differentiae
D.M. Balme
In Gotthelf and Lennox, eds., Philosophical Issues in Aristotle's Biology
Cambridge, 1987

"[H]is whole teleological view of animals depends upon his belief that bodily parts are explainable by activities, not vice versa (PA I 645b14). In practice he is just as ready to argue from habitat or nutrition or behavior or breeding characteristics; in short, from all the kinds of differentia which he distinguishes in the HA under the headings of 'parts, lives, activities, character' (HA I 487a11)." (BALME-1987b, p. 88)
