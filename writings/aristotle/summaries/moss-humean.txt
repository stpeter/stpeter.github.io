What Aristotle a Humean?

"A crucial part of what it is to do something through deliberation is to recognize what one is doing as being for the sake of an end, and to use that end to guide one's deliberations: as Aristotle puts it ... 'the one who deliberates, if he has carried his inquiry back from the end, deliberates about what is toward it, in order to bring the process back to himself, or what he can do himself toward the end.' (EE II.11 1227a13-18) Thus 'supposition of the end' in [EE 1126b20ff] evidently means ... the grasping of the end qua end, that is, the using of the end to guide deliberation.... Being good at working out how to achieve the end involves correctly grasping the end as one's end, and that is a job for reason rather than for character." (MOSS, pp. 231-232)

"As the characterization of deliberation as 'contemplation of the final cause' emphasizes, Aristotelian reasoning is essentially an understanding of causal relations, and the means-end relation is one such relation: only someone who understands that relation can aim at an end." (MOSS, p. 232)

When speaking of Aristotle's "characterization of the virtuous person's goal as something that must be made determinate (horismenon)" and "his treatment of deliberating as a form of defining or determining (horizein)", Moss points out: "He tells us repeatedly that virtue aims at the fine (to kalon, EN III.7 1115b13-14, IV.1 1120a23-24, and EE III.1 1230a27-29). He also famously tells us that it aims at 'the intermediate': virtue aims at (is stochastike of) the intermediate in actions and passions, that is, what is most appropriate (EN II.6 1106b28, II.9 1109a22-23); for a virtuous person, the intermediate is the that-for-the-sake-of-which, the goal (EE II.11 1227b36-38). We can charitably - and plausibly - assume that these descriptions are meant to to be equivalent.... Nothing counts as intermediate unless it is determinate: not too much and not too little, but precisely the right amount. (See also the claim that there is a horos (boundary - the noun cognate with horizein) of mean states, at NE VI.2 1138b23.) Notably, in his most explicit definition of the fine Aristotle describes this too as determinate: the three greatest species of the fine are order, symmetry, and 'the determinate' (to horismenon; Metaphysics XIII.3 1078a36-b1).... Aristotle frequently describes deliberation as a process of determination: deliberation is about things that are as yet 'undetermined' (adiorison, EN II.3 1112b9).... 'The object of deliberation and the object of decision are the same, but the object of decision is already determined (aphorismenon)' (EN III.2 1113a3-4), that is, through the preceding deliberation." (MOSS, pp. 235-238)
