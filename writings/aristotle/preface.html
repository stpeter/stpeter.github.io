<h2>Preface to Complete Thyself</h2>

<p>If you are an intellectually curious person who continually strives to become a better, wiser human being, this book was written with you in mind.</p>
<p>Although Aristotle lived some 2400 years ago, his works can still help us on the path to fulfillment. Yet Aristotle is decidedly not a self-help author. His thinking can be deep, heavy, dense, and hard to decipher. Scholars endlessly debate his theories, but only rarely do they relate his insights to the great task of living well.</p>
<p>Indeed, many years ago, when I was a budding student of ancient Greek philosophy at Columbia University, one of my mentors said to me: "It doesn't matter what's true, it matters what you can get published." That was excellent career advice, because it led me to abandon academia in favor of a successful career as a technologist. However, it was lousy philosophy, because nothing matters more than the truths that free us to be, not merely highly accomplished in our careers, but highly accomplished as human beings.</p>
<p>This is the promise of what Socrates called the examined life, and it is a promise that Aristotle's philosophy fulfills in spades, if only we can come to understand it.</p>
<p>Ideally what we'd like is to have is a long, deep conversation with Aristotle himself about how to find fulfillment as a human being. Of course that's impossible, so second best would be to read a written dialogue that emulates such a conversation; Aristotle wrote a few of those, but unfortunately only fragments survived the collapse of classical civilization. Third best is to trace the dialectical flow of his formal writings on the highest good attainable by human beings.</p>
<p>Although there are countless scholarly books and papers about Aristotle (and I've read hundreds of them), the vast majority are produced by professors who, for better or for worse, must focus on what they can get published by academic journals and presses. By contrast, my focus is on <em>actionable truth</em> and <em>how to live</em>. My interpretation is grounded in philosophical scholarship, but above all I have tried to show how Aristotle's insights can be applied to the real world we live in today.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
