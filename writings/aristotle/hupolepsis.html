<h1>ὑπόληψις / ὑπολαμβάνω in Aristotle</h1>
<h2>translated by Peter Saint-Andre</h2>
<p>The following passages constitute occurrences of the terms ὑπόληψις and ὑπολαμβάνω in the works of Aristotle.</p>
<ul>
  <li>66b19 συμβαίνει δ᾽ ἐνίοτε, καθάπερ ἐν τῇ θέσει τῶν ὅρων ἀπατώμεθα, καὶ κατὰ τὴν ὑποληψιν γίνεσθαι τὴν ἀπάτην = "it sometimes happens that just as we are deceived in how definitions are set forth, so also deception can arise from conjecture"</li>
  <li>79b26-28 in a discussion of ἄγνοια, Aristotle notes that the ὑπόληψις ("conjecture"?) that a quality does or does not belong to something can come about either ἁπλῶς (plain and simple) or διὰ συλλογισμοῦ (through reasoning)</li>
  <li>88b37 ἐπιστήμη ἀναπόδεικτος is ὑπόληψις τῆς ἀμέσου προτάτεως = "understanding that does not spell things out is ὑπόληψις ("belief" or "conjecture") regarding a non-intermediate proposition" … but how is conjecture a form of ἐπιστήμη?</li>
  <li>89a39 φανερὸν δ᾽ ἐκ τοῦτων ὅτι οὐδὲ δοξάζειν ἅμα τὸ αὐτὸ καὶ ἐπίστασθαι ἐνδέχεται. ἅμα γὰρ ἂν ἔχοι ὑπόληψιν τοῦ ἄλλως ἔχειν καὶ μὴ ἄλλως τὸ αὐτό = "from this it is clear that one cannot have both opinion and understanding of the same thing at the same time, for one would at the same time hold the ὑπόληψις ("belief" or "conjecture") that the thing can be other than it is and cannot be other than it is"</li>
  <li>126b18 δοκεῖ γὰρ ... ἡ πίστις ὑπόληψις σφοδρά  = "conviction seems to be a strongly-held belief/conjecture"</li>
  <li>149a10 ἡ γὰρ ὑπόληψις τῇ ἐπιστήμῃ οὐ ταὐτόν = "belief/conjecture is not the same as understanding"</li>
  <li>279a4 ??</li>
  <li>279b6 ὑπόληψεις = "conjecture" that the heavens are generated or ungenerated, destructible or indestructible</li>
  <li>339b20 Aristotle describes a certain δόξα as ἀρχαία τις ὑπόληψις = "an ancient conjecture"</li>
  <li>345b10 ὑπόληψις = there is a third "conjecture" about the milky way</li>
  <li>354b23 καὶ περὶ θαλάττης τὴν πρώτην λαβεῖν ὑπόληψιν ἀναγκαῖον ὀρθῶς = "it is necessary to correctly form an initial conjecture about the oceans"</li>
  <li>427b14-17 φαντασία γὰρ ἕτερον καὶ αἰσθήσεως καὶ διανοίας · αὐτὴ τε οὐ γίνεται ἄνευ αἰσθήσεως, καὶ ἄνευ ταύτης οὐκ ἔστιν ὑπόληψις. ὅτι δ᾽ οὐκ ἔστιν ἡ αὐτὴ νόησις καὶ ὑπόληψις, φανερόν. = "an impression is different from both perception and thinking; it does not arise without perception, nor does conjecture arise without it, and it is clear that it is not the same kind of insight as conjecture"</li>
  <li>427b24-28 εἰσὶ δὲ καὶ αὐτῆς τῆς ὑπολήψεως διαφοραί, ἐπιστήμη καῖ δόξα καὶ φρόνησις καὶ τἀναντία τούτων, περὶ ὧν τῆς διαφορᾶς ἕτερος ἔστω λόγος. περὶ δὲ τοῦ νοεῖν, έπεὶ ἕτερον τοῦ αἰσθάνεσθαι, τοῦτο δὲ τὸ μὲν φαντασία δοκεῖ εἶναι τὸ δὲ ὑπόληψις… = "There are several varieties of conjecture: understanding, opinion, wisdom, and their opposites; of their differences I will speak elsewhere. Since thinking differs from perception, it seems to be partly impression and partly conjecture…"</li>
  <li>462b14-15 ὑπολαμβάνειν = all people "believe" or "conjecture" that dreams have meaning</li>
  <li>981a7 γίγνεται δὲ τέχνη ὅταν ἐκ πολλῶν τῆς ἐμπειρίας ἐννοημάτων μία καθόλου γένηται περὶ τῶν ὁμοίων ὑπόληψις = "craft comes into being when from many notions gained by experience one universal belief arises about similar things" (e.g., experience that a certain course of treatment helped Callias, and Socrates, and other men)</li>
  <li>982a6 τὰς ὑπολήψεις ἃς ἔχομεν περὶ τοῦ σοφοῦ = "the conjectures/beliefs we have about the sage"</li>
  <li>983b22ff ὑπόληψις = the "conjecture" of Thales that the source of all things is water</li>
  <li>989a12 οὕτως ἀρχαίαν καὶ δημοτικὴν συμβέβηκεν εἶναι τὴν ὑπόληψιν = "so ancient and popular has been this belief"</li>
  <li>990b23 ὑπόληψις = the assumption that underlies "belief" in Ideas</li>
  <li>1010a10 ἐκ γὰρ ταύτης τῆς ὑπολήψεως ἐξήνθησεν ἡ ἀκροτάτη δόξα = "from this belief [that because everything constantly changes nothing can be affirmed] blossomed the most extreme opinion [of the professed Heracilteans]"</li>
  <li>1062b21 λύοιτο δ᾽ ἂν αὕτη ἡ ἀπορία θεωρήσασι πόθεν ἐλήλυθεν ἡ ἀρχὴ τῆς ὑπολήψεως ταύτης = "we can free ourselves from the impasse by making ourselves aware of the source of this belief"</li>
  <li>1073a17 ἡ μὲν γὰρ περὶ τὰς ἰδέας ὑπόληψις οὐδεμίαν ἔχει σκέψιν ἰδίαν = "the belief in Ideas has no special view about this"</li>
  <li>1079a19 same as 990b23 above</li>
  <li>1139b17 ὑπολήψει γὰρ καὶ δόξῃ ἐνδέχεται διαψεύδεσθαι = "for belief and opinion can be mistaken"</li>
  <li>1140b13ff οὐ γὰρ ἅπασαν ὑπόληψιν διαφθείρει οὐδὲ διαστρέφει τὸ ἡδὺ καὶ λυπηρόν ... ἀλλὰ τὰς περὶ τὸ πρακτόν = "it is not every belief that the pleasant and painful destroy and corrupt ... but only those about what is to be done"</li>
  <li>1145b36-1146a1 μηδ᾽ ἰσχυρὰ ὑπόληψις ἡ ἀντιτείνουσα ἀλλ᾽ ἠρεμαία = "not a strong belief but a weak one that resists" [in cases of ἀκρασία]</li>
  <li>1146b28 παρὰ τὴν ὑπόληψιν πράξουσιν ="acting against one's belief"</li>
  <li>1147b5 ὥστε καὶ διὰ τοῦτο τὰ θηρία οὐκ ἀκρατῆ, ὅτι οὐκ ἔχει καθόλου ὑπόληψιν ἀλλὰ τῶν καθ᾽ ἕκαστα φαντασίαν καὶ μνήμην = "so that animals do not experience ἀκρασία because they do not have universal beliefs but only impressions and memories of particulars"</li>
  <li>1197a30 see above under ἐπαμφοτερίζει</li>
  <li>1235a20 αὗται μὲν οὖν αἱ ὑπολήψεις τοσοῦτον διεστᾶσιν = "such is the discrepancy between these beliefs"</li>
  <li>1301a37 καὶ διὰ ταύτην τὴν αἰτίαν, ὅταν μὴ κατὰ τὴν ὑπόληψιν ἣν ἑκάτεροι τυγχάνουσιν ἔχοντες μετέχωσι τῆς πολιτείας, στασιάζουσιν = "for this reason, whenever their share in governance doesn't align with their beliefs, they foment revolution"</li>
  <li>1312a34 οἷς ἀκολουθεῖν μὲν δεῖ τὴν Δίωνος ὑπόληψιν = "he must have the kind of belief that Dion had"</li>
  <li>1339b7 τὴν ὑπόληψιν ἣν ἔχομεν περὶ τῶν θεῶν = "the beliefs we have about the gods"</li>
  <li>1416a4 περὶ δὲ διαβολῆς ἓν μὲν τὸ ἐξ ὧν ἄν τις ὑπόληψιν δυσχερῆ ἀπολύσαιτο = "in combatting prejudice, one strategy is to dispel objectionable beliefs about oneself"</li>
  <li>1417b10 ὑπόληψιν = coming to a "conjecture" merely from the look of a messenger</li>
  <li>1442b19 οὐ δίκαιον καὶ νόμινον οὐδὲ συμφέρον ἐκ τῆς ὑπολήψεως ἣ τῆς ὑποψίας κατακρίνειν πρὶν τοῦ πράγματος ἀκοῦσαι = "it is not just or lawful or expedient to judge based on a conjecture or suspicion before listening to the facts"</li>
