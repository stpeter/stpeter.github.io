<h2>An Aristotelian Glossary</h2>
<h2>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h2>
<p>Last Updated: 2023-11-25</p>
<p><em>These are the key terms used in my forthcoming book <a href='/writings/aristotle/'>Complete Thyself: Aristotle on Human Fulfillment</a>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li><p id='Activity'><strong>Activity</strong> translates energeia (ἐνέργεια). This is perhaps the most important concept in Aristotle's account of human <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a>. Its core meaning is being engaged in working at a <a href='#Task'>Task</a>, which is why translator Joe Sachs rendered it as "being-at-work". Aristotle repeatedly points out that it's not good enough to be <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> in your <a href='#Character'>Character</a> and <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a>, if that means merely having a <a href='#Trait'>Trait</a> but not using and applying it in your <a href='#Practice'>Practice</a> (after all, even someone who is asleep can <em>have</em> a trait). In short, life simply <em>is</em> activity. [Traditionally rendered as Actuality.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Aliveness'><strong>Aliveness</strong> translates psuchē (ψυχή). Aliveness is what animates a living being, what makes it a living thing. Even plants have psuchē! The specifics of an organism's Aliveness are <a href='#Inherent'>Inherent</a> in its <a href='#Nature'>Nature</a> and its characteristic <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Soul.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Awareness'><strong>Awareness</strong> translates theōria (θεωρία). At root, the <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a> that mostly starkly separates humans and other animals from plants and inanimate objects is their keen awareness of the world around them. For the other animals, this takes the form of the <a href='#Capacity'>Capacity</a> for perception (aisthesis), including limited varieties of memory, imagination, and foresight. To this humans add <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a> and a full range of symbolic faculties, such as speech, recollection, planning, and culture - all of which are built upon the foundation of conceptual awareness. Most intensively, human awareness arises when we actively use and apply our <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> of ourselves and the world around us, in the <a href='#Activity'>Activities</a> of ethical <a href='#Practice'>Practice</a> and intellectual <a href='#Inquiry'>Inquiry</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Contemplation.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Bad'><strong>Bad</strong> translates kakos (κακός).</p></li>
  <li><p id='Balance-Point'><strong>Balance-Point</strong> translates meson (μέσον). All <a href='#Thrivings'>Thrivings</a> of <a href='#Character'>Character</a> and <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a> avoid excesses in our actions and reactions, whether falling short or going beyond what is <a href='#Fitting'>Fitting</a> or <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a>. When we hit the <a href='#Target'>Target</a>, we've reached a Balance-Point that is worth savoring and beholding. [Traditionally rendered as the Mean.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Beautifully-Right'><strong>Beautifully Right</strong> translates kalos (καλός). [Traditionally rendered as Noble.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Capacity'><strong>Capacity</strong> translates dunamis (δύναμις). [Traditionally rendered as Potentiality.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Character'><strong>Character</strong> translates ēthos (ἦθος).</p></li>
  <li><p id='Commitment'><strong>Commitment</strong> translates prohairesis (προαίρεσις). A Commitment is a reliable preference for one <a href='#Practice'>Practice</a> over another. Commitment to a <a href='#Practice'>Practice</a> is much more powerful and thoroughgoing than a decision to take an action in a particular situation, because it shapes the form and pattern of all of your decisions and actions. This is why a <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> of <a href='#Character'>Character</a> is a <a href='#Trait'>Trait</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Decision.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Complete'><strong>Complete</strong> translates teleia (τελεία). [Traditionally rendered as Perfect.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Completion'><strong>Completion</strong> translates entelecheia (ἐντελέχεια). [Traditionally rendered as Actuality.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Correct'><strong>Correct</strong> translates orthos (ὀρθός). [Traditionally rendered as Right.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Corruption'><strong>Corruption</strong> translates mochthēria (μοχθηρία). The thoroughly corrupted person has no <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> of human <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a> and the <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a> <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>, and therefore consistently engages in ignoble actions and feelings. [Traditionally rendered as Evil.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Craft'><strong>Craft</strong> translates technē (τέχνη). [Traditionally rendered as Art.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Decadence'><strong>Decadence</strong> translates akolasia (ἀκολασία). The decadent person has one policy in life: to pursue immediate pleasure and <a href='#Enjoyment'>Enjoyment</a> without regard to whether or not the <a href='#Activity'>Activities</a> that gives rise to it are <a href='#Inherent'>Inherently</a> <a href='#Good'>Good</a>, <a href='#Serious'>Serious</a>, or <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a>. Indeed, because Decadence is one variety of <a href='#Corruption'>Corruption</a>, the decadent person reliably indulges in the exact opposite: activities that are bad, unworthy, and repulsively wrong.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Deliberation'><strong>Deliberation</strong> translates bouleusis (βουλεύσις).</p></li>
  <li><p id='Enculturation'><strong>Enculturation</strong> translates ethismos (ἐθισμός). Although ethismos is often rendered as habituation, it is actually a process of mindfully acquiring the <a href='#trait'>Traits</a> of <a href='#Practice'>Practice</a> and <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a> that provide a foundation for <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Habituation.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Enjoyment'><strong>Enjoyment</strong> translates hēdonē (ἡδονή). Every kind of <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a> has its own <a href='#Inherent'>Inherent</a> kind of enjoyment: the joys of eating, say, are quite different from the joys of beholding works of art. This is why the <a href='#Standard'>Standard</a> of what's truly enjoyable is the <a href='#Serious'>Serious</a> person of <a href='#Complete'>Complete</a> <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> in both <a href='#Character'>Character</a> and <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Pleasure.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Fitting'><strong>Fitting</strong> translates prepon (πρέπον). [Traditionally rendered as Appropriate.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Freedom'><strong>Freedom</strong> translates eleutheria (ἐλευθερία). For the ancient Greeks, the highest freedom was not freedom from government but freedom from the necessity of work, strife, war, and other forms of hard toil. This state of peace and ease freed them up for <a href='#Activity'>Activities</a> that are <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a>, such as conversation with loved ones, games and festivals, artistic appreciation, intellectual inquiry, and philosophical speculation</p></li>
  <li><p id='Fulfillment'><strong>Fulfillment</strong> translates eudaimonia (εὐδαιμονία). [Traditionally rendered as Happiness.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Good'><strong>Good</strong> translates agathos (ἀγαθός).</p></li>
  <li><p id='Humaneness'><strong>Humaneness</strong> translates epieikeia (ἐπιείκεια).</p></li>
  <li><p id='Identity'><strong>Identity</strong> translates to ti ēn einai (τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι). Literally, this phrase means "what it is to be a thing". The Romans translated it as "essentia", which was modernized as "essence", thus leading to all sorts of confusion about independently existing essences. Aristotle's idea is much more straightforward, and is most reasonably Englished as "identity". [Traditionally rendered as Essence.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Inherent'><strong>Inherent</strong> translates oikeios (οἰκεῖος). The Greek word oikeios derives from their word for home, and thus connotes that which is close to home, native as opposed to foreign, familiar as opposed to strange, inner as opposed to outer, and that which is inherently bound up with the nature of a thing. A good example is the intimate tie between an <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a> and the <a href='#Enjoyment'>Enjoyment</a> that completes it. [Traditionally rendered as Proper.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Inquiry'><strong>Inquiry</strong> translates zētēsis (ζήτησις).</p></li>
  <li><p id='Insight'><strong>Insight</strong> translates nous (νοῦς). Whereas <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> goes deep to elucidate the factors responsible for the <a href='#Identity'>Identity</a> common to all entities that share a <a href='#Nature'>Nature</a>, Insight is the <a href='#Trait'>Trait</a> of <em>seeing</em> that underlying Identity <em>in</em> the particular entities and situations you encounter in <a href='#Inquiry'>Inquiry</a> and <a href='#Practice'>Practice</a>. Just as the <a href='#Inherent'>Inherent</a> <a href='#Activtity'>Activity</a> of <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> is <a href='#Explanation'>Explanation</a>, so the <a href='#Inherent'>Inherent</a> <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a> of Insight is calling in the particulars as witnesses to the deep <a href='#Nature'>Nature</a> of the entity under consideration. [Traditionally rendered as Mind or Intuition.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Leisure'><strong>Leisure</strong> translates scholē (σχολή). We moderns think of leisure as the relatively brief episodes between longer stretches of work, or as the golden years of fun and relaxation after retirement from a career; for us work is fundamental and leisure is the absence of work. By contrast, for the ancient Greeks (or at least the aristocracy) scholē was fundamental and work was ascholia: the absence of leisure. Scholē is the <a href='#Purpose'>Purpose</a> of people who live in <a href='#Freedom'>Freedom</a> and is to be spent not in frivolous amusements but in <a href='#Serious'>Serious</a> pursuits like artistic appreciation and intellectual inquiry.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Life'><strong>Life</strong> translates zōē (ζωή).</p></li>
  <li><p id='Love'><strong>Love</strong> translates philia (φιλία). [Traditionally rendered as Friendship.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Moderation'><strong>Moderation</strong> translates sōphrosunē (σωφροσύνη). Aristotle never said to pursue moderation in everything, but Moderation might be the best way to render the multifaceted Greek word sōphrosunē. This <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> of <a href='#Character'>Character</a> implies an ability to temper your <a href='#Reaction'>Reactions</a>, to keep your head in difficult situations, to avoid excess, and to honor the Delphic maxim "Nothing Too Much". [Traditionally rendered as Temperance.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Nature'><strong>Nature</strong> translates phusis (φύσις).</p></li>
  <li><p id='Need'><strong>Need</strong> translates epithumia (ἐπιθυμία). Of the three kinds of <a href='#Reaching'>Reaching</a>, Need is the most basic. Even plants have needs for sunlight, water, air, and nutrients in the earth, which enable them to live, grow, and reproduce. Although animals and humans experience more advanced levels of <a href='#Awareness'>Awareness</a> and thus have <a href='#Want'>Wants</a> and (for humans) <a href='#Resolution'>Resolutions</a> to action, they too have inescapable Needs that are <a href='#Inherent'>Inherent</a> in the processes of <a href='#Life'>Life</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Practice'><strong>Practice</strong> translates praxis (πρᾶξις). [Traditionally rendered as Action.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Purpose'><strong>Purpose</strong> translates telos (τέλος). </p></li>
  <li><p id='Reaching'><strong>Reaching</strong> translates orexis (ὄρεξις). All living organisms reach out into the world to achieve <a href='#Purpose'>Purposes</a> such as metabolism, growth, and reproduction. For Aristotle, there are three kinds of reaching: <a href='#Need'>Needs</a> (evident even in plants), <a href='#Want'>Wants</a> (which emerge with <a href='#Awareness'>Awareness</a> and locomotion in animals), and <a href='#Resolution'>Resolution</a> (which results from <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a>, <a href='#Deliberation'>Deliberation</a>, and <a href='#Commitment'>Commitment</a> in humans). [Traditionally rendered as Desire.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Reaction'><strong>Reaction</strong> translates pathos (πάθος). [Traditionally rendered as Passion.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Resolution'><strong>Resolution</strong> translates boulēsis (βούλησις). Beyond <a href='#Need'>Needs</a> and <a href='#Want'>Wants</a>, humans can resolve to take action based on their <a href='#Deliberation'>Deliberations</a> about the future. The close connection between Deliberation and Resolution can be seen in their Greek roots: bouleusis or taking counsel leads to boulēsis or forming a resolution. Because Deliberation is an action-oriented form of <a href='#Inquiry'>Inquiry</a>, Resolution is bound up with <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a> and conceptual <a href='#Awareness'>Awareness</a>; because the <a href='#Commitment'>Commitment</a> that produces a Resolution is part and parcel of <a href='#Practice'>Practices</a>, Resolution is bound up with <a href='#Character'>Character</a> and acquired <a href='#Trait'>Traits</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Wish.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Sagacity'><strong>Sagacity</strong> translates sophia (σοφία). Sagacity is the combination of <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> and <a href='#Insight'>Insight</a>. Whereas the <a href='#Trait'>Trait</a> of <a href='#Wisdom'>Wisdom</a> is focused on good <a href='#Deliberation'>Deliberation</a> and good <a href='#Practice'>Practice</a>, Sagacity is focused on finding <a href='#Truth'>Truth</a> regarding human <a href='#Nature'>Nature</a> and human <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a>. Thus its opposites are ignorance and sophistry about the <a href='#Good'>Good</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Theoretical Wisdom.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Self-Indulgence'><strong>Self-Indulgence</strong> translates akrasia (ἀκρασία). The self-indulgent or unrestrained person has some <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> of human <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a> and the <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a> <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>, but that knowledge is frequently overruled by momentary <a href='#Want'>Wants</a> to indulge in ignoble actions and <a href='#Reaction'>Reactions</a>, at least in some domains of life. Although this kind of person has not descended into <a href='#Corruption'>Corruption</a> or <a href='#Decadence'>Decadence</a>, they don't have a consistent <a href='#Practice'>Practice</a> of <a href='#Correct'>Correct</a> action and Reaction, and thus doesn't experience inner harmony. [Traditionally rendered as Incontinence.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Self-Restraint'><strong>Self-Restraint</strong> translates enkrateia (ἐγκράτεια). The self-restrained person has a fairly complete <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> of human <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a> and the <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a> <a href='Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>, and uses that knowledge to override momentary <a href='#Want'>Wants</a> to indulge in ignoble actions and <a href='#Reaction'>Reactions</a>, at least in some domains of life. This kind of person takes <a href='#Correct'>Correct</a> action (in contrast to the <a href='#Self-Indulgence'>Self-Induglent</a> person) but doesn't have consistently <a href='#Correct'>Correct</a> <a href='#Reaction'>Reactions</a>, and thus doesn't always experience inner harmony. [Traditionally rendered as Continence.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Serious'><strong>Serious</strong> translates spoudaios (σπουδαῖος). The completely <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> person who takes life seriously has a thorough <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> of human <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a> and the <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a> <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>, and also has a settled <a href='#Commitment'>Commitment</a> to consistently apply that knowledge in their <a href='#Practice'>Practices</a> and <a href='#Reaction'>Reactions</a>. As a result, this kind of person reliably experiences inner harmony and represents a <a href='#Standard'>Standard</a> for <a href='#Wisdom'>Wisdom</a> and the <a href='#Good'>Good</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Good.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Social'><strong>Social</strong> translates politikē (πολιτική). Although it is characteristic of humans to live in a town or city (a polis), Aristotle identified a wide variety of social animals and was especially impressed with social insects like ants and honeybees. All such creatures live in societies that have a common <a href='#Purpose'>Purpose</a> on which they collaborate in different ways. For other animals this goal is mere <a href='#Life'>Life</a>, but for humans it is living well or <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a>, which involves highly sophisticated forms of social interaction that give rise to both political <a href='#Deliberation'>Deliberation</a> and philosophical <a href='#Inquiry'>Inquiry</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Political.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Standard'><strong>Standard</strong> translates horos (ὅρος).</p></li>
  <li><p id='Target'><strong>Target</strong> translates skopos (σκοπός).</p></li>
  <li><p id='Task'><strong>Task</strong> translates ergon (ἔργον). In his biological research, Aristotle thought it was important to identify the contributions of particular parts of the body to the organism's overall <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>: the eyes for seeing, the feet for moving, the hands for grasping, etc. By extension, every living thing has a Task that consists of its characteristic <a href='#Activity'>Activities</a>; for human beings, this is activity in accordance with <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a> and <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Function.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Thinghood'><strong>Thinghood</strong> translates ousia (οὐσία). [Traditionally rendered as Substance.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Thinking'><strong>Thinking</strong> translates logos (λόγος). Human life is saturated with language and the thinking that lies behind language. These phenomena, two sides of the same coin, are the core meanings of the multifaceted Greek word logos. Thinking in the widest sense is our distinctive mode of <a href='#Awareness'>Awareness</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Reason.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Thriving'><strong>Thriving</strong> translates aretē (ἀρετή). Thriving has biological roots in <a href='#Life'>Life</a> and <a href='#Social'>Social</a> roots in the human <a href='Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>. Building on the Homeric verb ἀρετάω (to prosper, to fare well), I turn the infinitive of the English verb "to thrive" into a noun, so that we can speak of, say, generosity as a Thriving of <a href='#Character'>Character</a>. Every Thriving is <a href='#Trait'>Trait</a> that finds the <a href='#Balance-Point'>Balance-Point</a> between falling short or going too far in a specific domain of life: courage between cowardice and rashness, generosity between stinginess and profligacy, and so on. [Traditionally rendered as Virtue.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Trait'><strong>Trait</strong> translates hexis (ἕξις). [Traditionally rendered as Habit.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Truth'><strong>Truth</strong> translates alētheia (ἀλήθεια). Truth is the <a href='#Purpose'>Purpose</a> of all <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a>. To grasp truth (aletheia) is to lack (a-) forgetting (lethe) and thus to have steadfast <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> and <a href='#Awareness'>Awareness</a> of the world or some aspect thereof. The only way do this is to engage in the <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a> of applying your <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> of things both in <a href='#Inquiry'>Inquiry</a> and in <a href='Practice'>Practice</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Understanding'><strong>Understanding</strong> translates epistēmē (ἐπιστήμη). To truly know something is to understand how to explain why it is the way it is. This is a tall order, for a thing's <a href='#Identity'>Identity</a> includes its <a href='#Nature'>Nature</a>, its <a href='#Capacity'>Capacities</a>, its <a href='#Way-of-Being'>Way of Being</a> (for living things its <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>), and the multifarious factors responsible for these phenomena. Once acquired, this kind of Understanding becomes firmly rooted in your mind as a <a href='#Trait'>Trait</a> of grasping <a href='#Truth'>Truth</a> and thus becomes a foundation for <a href='#Wisdom'>Wisdom</a> and <a href='#Sagacity'>Sagacity</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Knowledge.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Valuable'><strong>Valuable</strong> translates haireta (αἱρετά). [Traditionally rendered as Choiceworthy.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Want'><strong>Want</strong> translates thumos (θυμός). Beyond <a href='#Need'>Needs</a>, animals also have Wants, which arise because animals have <a href='#Capacity'>Capacities</a> both for perceptual <a href='#Awareness'>Awareness</a> and for movement in place. Thus animals can pursue things they perceive as <a href='#Good'>Good</a> or beneficial and avoid things they perceive as <a href='#Bad'>Bad</a> or harmful.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Way-of-Being'><strong>Way of Being</strong> translates eidos (εἶδος). [Traditionally rendered as Form.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Way-of-Life'><strong>Way of Life</strong> translates bios (βίος).</p></li>
  <li><p id='Wholeness'><strong>Wholeness</strong> translates autarkeia (αὐτάρκεια). [Traditionally rendered as Self-Sufficiency.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Wisdom'><strong>Wisdom</strong> translates phronēsis (φρόνησις). As with every other <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a>, Wisdom is a <a href='#Balance-Point'>Balance-Point</a>, in this case between foolishness and cunning. Yet Wisdom plays a special role in unifying your <a href='#Character'>Character</a>, because it helps you discover every other Balance-Point and thus is a kind of master <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Practical Wisdom.]</p></li>
