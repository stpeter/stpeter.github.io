<p><em>These are the key terms used in my forthcoming book <a href='/writings/aristotle/'>Complete Thyself: Aristotle on Human Fulfillment</a>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li><p id='Activity'><strong>Activity</strong> translates <em>energeia</em> (ἐνέργεια). This is perhaps the most important concept in Aristotle's account of human <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a>. Its core meaning is being engaged in working at a <a href='#Task'>Task</a>, which is why translator Joe Sachs rendered it as "being-at-work". Aristotle repeatedly points out that it's not good enough to be <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> in your <a href='#Character'>Character</a> and <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a>, if that means merely having a <a href='#Trait'>Trait</a> but not using and applying it in your life <a href='#Conduct'>Conduct</a> (after all, even someone who is asleep can <em>have</em> a trait). In short, life simply <em>is</em> activity. [Traditionally rendered as Actuality.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Aliveness'><strong>Aliveness</strong> translates <em>psuchē</em> (ψυχή). Aliveness is what animates a living being, what makes it a living thing. Even plants have psuchē! The specifics of an organism's Aliveness are <a href='#Inherent'>Inherent</a> in its <a href='#Nature'>Nature</a> and its characteristic <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Soul.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Awareness'><strong>Awareness</strong> translates <em>theōria</em> (θεωρία). At root, the <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a> that mostly starkly separates humans and other animals from plants and inanimate objects is their keen awareness of the world around them. For the other animals, this takes the form of the <a href='#Capacity'>Capacity</a> for perception (<em>aisthesis</em>), including limited varieties of memory, imagination, and foresight. To this humans add <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a> and a full range of symbolic faculties, such as speech, recollection, planning, and culture - all of which are built upon the foundation of conceptual awareness. Most intensively, human awareness arises when we actively use and apply our <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> of ourselves and the world around us, in the <a href='#Activity'>Activities</a> of ethical <a href='#Conduct'>Conduct</a> and intellectual <a href='#Inquiry'>Inquiry</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Contemplation.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Bad'><strong>Bad</strong> translates <em>kakos</em> (κακός). As with the <a href='#Good'>Good</a>, what's Bad is what is actually (not apparently) detrimental, harmful, or damaging to a living organism.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Balance-Point'><strong>Balance-Point</strong> translates <em>meson</em> (μέσον). All <a href='#Thrivings'>Thrivings</a> of <a href='#Character'>Character</a> and <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a> avoid excesses in our <a href='#Conduct'>Conduct</a> and <a href='#Emotion'>Emotions</a>, whether falling short or going beyond what is <a href='#Fitting'>Fitting</a> or <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a>. When we hit the <a href='#Target'>Target</a>, we've reached a Balance-Point that is worth savoring and beholding. [Traditionally rendered as the Mean.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Beautifully-Right'><strong>Beautifully Right</strong> translates <em>kalos</em> (καλός). The Greek word kalos straddles the line between ethics and aesthetics: it can mean beautiful, fine, right, noble, and so on. Rendering it as "beautifully right" does justice to both of these aspects. All of the <a href='#Thriving'>Thrivings</a> of <a href='#Character'>Character</a> are done for the benefit (the <a href='#Good'>Good</a>) of the individual and with the aim of doing what is Beautifully Right. [Traditionally rendered as Noble.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Capacity'><strong>Capacity</strong> translates <em>dunamis</em> (δύναμις). All living things have bodily parts that afford the ability to engage in certain <a href='#Activity'>Activities</a>, such as seeing, hearing, walking, flying, swimming, grazing, hunting, finding shelter, building nests, remembering things, and using tools. In humans, the range of Capacities widens considerably to include <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a>, language, planning, learning <a href='#Skill'>Skills</a>, and so on - all of which provide a foundation for individual and societal development, interpersonal relationships, personal <a href='#Trait'>Traits</a>, and human <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Potentiality.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Character'><strong>Character</strong> translates <em>ēthos</em> (ἦθος). A person's Character consists of the stable set of qualities of <a href='#Conduct'>Conduct</a> and <a href='#Emotion'>Emotion</a> that informs their <a href='#Commitment'>Commitments</a> and establishes the aim of their <a href='#Deliberation'>Deliberations</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Commitment'><strong>Commitment</strong> translates <em>prohairesis</em> (προαίρεσις). A Commitment is a reliable preference for one pattern of <a href='#Conduct'>Conduct</a> over another. Commitment to a pattern of <a href='#Conduct'>Conduct</a> or practice of life is much more powerful and thoroughgoing than a decision to take a particular action in a particular situation, because it shapes the form of all of your decisions and actions. This is why a <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> of <a href='#Character'>Character</a> is a <a href='#Trait'>Trait</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Decision.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Complete'><strong>Complete</strong> translates <em>teleia</em> (τελεία). A living organism is Complete when it has fully developed and matured in accordance with its <a href='#Nature'>Nature</a> and <a href='#Purpose'>Purpose</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Perfect.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Completion'><strong>Completion</strong> translates <em>entelecheia</em> (ἐντελέχεια). Completion is the state of having become fully developed, and more precisely the full range of <a href='#Activity'>Activities</a> made possible by having become fully developed. [Traditionally rendered as Actuality.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Conduct'><strong>Conduct</strong> translates <em>praxis</em> (πρᾶξις). Conduct is an overall practice or pattern of active living and thus more significant than any particular action.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Correct'><strong>Correct</strong> translates <em>orthos</em> (ὀρθός). A Correct <a href='#Conduct'>Conduct</a> finds the active <a href='#Truth'>Truth</a> in particular situations and takes a straight path to the <a href='#Target'>Target</a> of <a href='#Conduct'>Conduct</a> and <a href='#Emotion'>Emotion</a>. The term is most common in the phrase orthos logos: the Correct <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a> underlyling the Correct Conduct in a given domain of life. [Traditionally rendered as Right.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Corruption'><strong>Corruption</strong> translates <em>mochthēria</em> (μοχθηρία). The thoroughly corrupted person has no <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> of human <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a> and the <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a> <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>, and therefore consistently engages in ignoble <a href='#Conduct'>Conduct</a> and <a href='#Emotion'>Emotions</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Evil.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Decadence'><strong>Decadence</strong> translates <em>akolasia</em> (ἀκολασία). The decadent person has one policy in life: to pursue immediate pleasure and <a href='#Enjoyment'>Enjoyment</a> without regard to whether or not the <a href='#Activity'>Activities</a> that gives rise to it are <a href='#Inherent'>Inherently</a> <a href='#Good'>Good</a>, <a href='#Serious'>Serious</a>, or <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a>. Indeed, because Decadence is one variety of <a href='#Corruption'>Corruption</a>, the decadent person reliably indulges in the exact opposite: activities that are bad, unworthy, and repulsively wrong.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Deliberation'><strong>Deliberation</strong> translates <em>bouleusis</em> (βουλεύσις). Deliberation is a form of <a href='#Inquiry'>Inquiry</a> that seeks to determine what is <a href='#Correct'>Correct</a> and <a href='#Truth'>True</a> with regard to the <a href='#Conduct'>Conduct</a> of living.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Emotion'><strong>Emotion</strong> translates <em>pathos</em> (πάθος). An Emotion is a feeling or mental state that you undergo because of your interaction with and assessment of things you experience in your environment. Because humans are deeply <a href='#Social'>Social</a> creatures, our most salient Emotions are interpersonal, such as anger, sympathy, and affection. Such Emotions are <a href='#Inherent'>Inherently</a> bound up with various <a href='#Thriving'>Thrivings</a>, such as gentleness, compassion, and benevolence. [Traditionally rendered as Passion.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Enjoyment'><strong>Enjoyment</strong> translates <em>hēdonē</em> (ἡδονή). Every kind of <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a> has its own <a href='#Inherent'>Inherent</a> kind of enjoyment: the joys of eating, say, are quite different from the joys of beholding works of art. This is why the <a href='#Standard'>Standard</a> of what's truly enjoyable is the <a href='#Serious'>Serious</a> person of <a href='#Complete'>Complete</a> <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> in both <a href='#Character'>Character</a> and <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Pleasure.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Fitting'><strong>Fitting</strong> translates <em>prepon</em> (πρέπον). What's Fitting is the <a href='#Conduct'>Conduct</a> or <a href='#Emotion'>Emotion</a> that is admirably appropriate or <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a> in a given situation.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Freedom'><strong>Freedom</strong> translates <em>eleutheria</em> (ἐλευθερία). For the ancient Greeks, the highest freedom was not freedom from government but freedom from the necessity of work, strife, war, and other forms of hard toil. This state of peace and ease freed them up for <a href='#Activity'>Activities</a> that are <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a>, such as conversation with loved ones, games and festivals, artistic appreciation, intellectual inquiry, and philosophical speculation</p></li>
  <li><p id='Fulfillment'><strong>Fulfillment</strong> translates <em>eudaimonia</em> (εὐδαιμονία). The first level of Fulfillment is the activation of all of your core human <a href='#Capacity'>Capacities</a> by developing the <a href='#Thriving'>Thrivings</a> of <a href='#Character'>Character</a> and <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a>. The second level is the <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a> of applying those Thrivings to the practice of living well, i.e., demonstrating a reliable <a href='#Commitment'>Commitment</a> to <a href='#Conduct'>Conduct</a> and <a href='#Emotion'>Emotions</a> that are <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a>. Becoming a fully developed person makes your life <a href='#Complete'>Complete</a>, <a href='#Wholeness'>Whole</a>, and uniquely <a href='#Valuable'>Valuable</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Happiness.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Good'><strong>Good</strong> translates <em>agathos</em> (ἀγαθός). Whereas most religions and modern ethical theories assert that the Good must conform to some pre-established rule, for Aristotle the Good is what benefits a living organism or person: not what merely seems to be beneficial, but what is truly beneficial in accordance with a being's <a href='#Nature'>Nature</a>, <a href='#Identity'>Identity</a>, <a href='#Task'>Task</a>, and <a href='#Purpose'>Purpose</a> (indeed, these terms are virtually synonymous). Thus <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a> is mostly objective, not subjective.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Growth'><strong>Growth</strong> translates <em>ethismos</em> (ἐθισμός). Growth is the process of mindfully developing the <a href='#trait'>Traits</a> of <a href='#Character'>Character</a> and <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a> that provide a foundation for <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Habituation.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Identity'><strong>Identity</strong> translates <em>to ti ēn einai</em> (τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι). Literally, this phrase means "what it is to be a thing". The Romans translated it as "essentia", which was modernized as "essence", thus leading to all sorts of confusion about independently existing essences. Aristotle's idea is much more straightforward, and is most reasonably Englished as "identity". [Traditionally rendered as Essence.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Inherent'><strong>Inherent</strong> translates <em>oikeios</em> (οἰκεῖος). The Greek word oikeios derives from their word for home, and thus connotes that which is close to home, native as opposed to foreign, familiar as opposed to strange, inner as opposed to outer, and that which is inherently bound up with the nature of a thing. A good example is the intimate tie between an <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a> and the <a href='#Enjoyment'>Enjoyment</a> that completes it. [Traditionally rendered as Proper.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Inquiry'><strong>Inquiry</strong> translates <em>zētēsis</em> (ζήτησις). Inquiry is the <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a> of seeking <a href='#Truth'>Truth</a>, whether in a purely intellectual pursuit or in the form of action-oriented <a href='#Deliberation'>Deliberation</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Insight'><strong>Insight</strong> translates <em>nous</em> (νοῦς). Whereas <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> goes deep to elucidate the factors responsible for the <a href='#Identity'>Identity</a> common to all entities that share a <a href='#Nature'>Nature</a>, Insight is the <a href='#Trait'>Trait</a> of <em>seeing</em> that underlying Identity <em>in</em> the particular entities and situations you encounter in intellectual <a href='#Inquiry'>Inquiry</a> and life <a href='#Conduct'>Conduct</a>. Just as the <a href='#Inherent'>Inherent</a> <a href='#Activtity'>Activity</a> of <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> is <a href='#Explanation'>Explanation</a>, so the <a href='#Inherent'>Inherent</a> <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a> of Insight is calling in the particulars as witnesses to the deep <a href='#Nature'>Nature</a> of the entity under consideration. [Traditionally rendered as Mind or Intuition.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Knowledge'><strong>Knowledge</strong> translates <em>gnōsis</em> (γνῶσις). There are several forms of Knowledge, including perception and <a href='#Insight'>Insight</a>. <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> imparts greater generality to such Knowledge by explaining why the things you know are the way they are. Of all the forms of knowledge, the most difficult to attain is self-knowledge, because human beings are their own greatest enigma; yet knowing yourself is the only reliable path to <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Leisure'><strong>Leisure</strong> translates <em>scholē</em> (σχολή). We moderns think of leisure as the relatively brief episodes between longer stretches of work, or as the golden years of fun and relaxation after retirement from a career; for us work is fundamental and leisure is the absence of work. By contrast, for the ancient Greeks (or at least the aristocracy) scholē was fundamental and work was ascholia: the absence of leisure. Scholē is the <a href='#Purpose'>Purpose</a> of people who live in <a href='#Freedom'>Freedom</a> and is to be spent not in frivolous amusements but in <a href='#Serious'>Serious</a> pursuits like artistic appreciation and intellectual inquiry.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Life'><strong>Life</strong> translates <em>zōē</em> (ζωή). Ancient Greek had two words for life: zōē (whence zoology) and bios (whence biology). The former signifies the life <a href='#Activity'>Activities</a> of any living thing, whereas the latter signifies the <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a> of an organism, especially of animals.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Love'><strong>Love</strong> translates <em>philia</em> (φιλία). The Greek word philia covers a wide range of close personal relationships, including the love and affection of parents, children, siblings, spouses, friends, even fellow citizens. The highest form of philia is rooted in the good <a href='#Character'>Character</a> of those involved in the relationship and provides a fertile field for applying all the <a href='#Thriving'>Thrivings</a> of <a href='#Character'>Character</a> and <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a> through the many <a href='#Activities'>Activities</a> of a shared life. [Traditionally rendered as Friendship.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Moderation'><strong>Moderation</strong> translates <em>sōphrosunē</em> (σωφροσύνη). Aristotle never said to pursue moderation in everything, but Moderation might be the best way to render the multifaceted Greek word sōphrosunē. This <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> of <a href='#Character'>Character</a> implies an ability to temper your <a href='#Emotion'>Emotions</a>, to keep your head in difficult situations, to avoid excess, and to honor the Delphic maxim "Nothing Too Much". [Traditionally rendered as Temperance.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Nature'><strong>Nature</strong> translates <em>phusis</em> (φύσις). A living thing's Nature is the full range of <a href='#Capacity'>Capacities</a> and <a href='#Activity'>Activities</a> that it grows into (<em>phuein</em>) as it develops and matures.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Need'><strong>Need</strong> translates <em>epithumia</em> (ἐπιθυμία). Of the three kinds of <a href='#Reaching'>Reaching</a>, Need is the most basic. Even plants have needs for sunlight, water, air, and nutrients in the earth, which enable them to live, grow, and reproduce. Although animals and humans experience more advanced levels of <a href='#Awareness'>Awareness</a> and thus have <a href='#Want'>Wants</a> and (for humans) <a href='#Resolution'>Resolutions</a> to action, they too have inescapable Needs that are <a href='#Inherent'>Inherent</a> in the processes of <a href='#Life'>Life</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Purpose'><strong>Purpose</strong> translates <em>telos</em> (τέλος). Every living organism serves a Purpose: not some cosmic end or something the benefits other beings, but its own <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a> in accordance with its own <a href='#Nature'>Nature</a> and <a href='#Inherent'>Inherent</a> <a href='#Task'>Task</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Reaching'><strong>Reaching</strong> translates <em>orexis</em> (ὄρεξις). All living organisms reach out into the world to achieve <a href='#Purpose'>Purposes</a> such as metabolism, growth, and reproduction. For Aristotle, there are three kinds of reaching: <a href='#Need'>Needs</a> (evident even in plants), <a href='#Want'>Wants</a> (which emerge with <a href='#Awareness'>Awareness</a> and locomotion in animals), and <a href='#Resolution'>Resolution</a> (which results from <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a>, <a href='#Deliberation'>Deliberation</a>, and <a href='#Commitment'>Commitment</a> in humans). [Traditionally rendered as Desire.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Resolution'><strong>Resolution</strong> translates <em>boulēsis</em> (βούλησις). Beyond <a href='#Need'>Needs</a> and <a href='#Want'>Wants</a>, humans can resolve to take action based on their <a href='#Deliberation'>Deliberations</a> about the future. The close connection between Deliberation and Resolution can be seen in their Greek roots: bouleusis or taking counsel leads to boulēsis or forming a resolution. Because Deliberation is an action-oriented form of <a href='#Inquiry'>Inquiry</a>, Resolution is bound up with <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a> and conceptual <a href='#Awareness'>Awareness</a>; because the <a href='#Commitment'>Commitment</a> that produces a Resolution is part and parcel of your life <a href='#Conduct'>Conduct</a>, Resolution is bound up with <a href='#Character'>Character</a> and acquired <a href='#Trait'>Traits</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Wish.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Sagacity'><strong>Sagacity</strong> translates <em>sophia</em> (σοφία). Sagacity is the combination of <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> and <a href='#Insight'>Insight</a>. Whereas the <a href='#Trait'>Trait</a> of <a href='#Wisdom'>Wisdom</a> is focused on good <a href='#Deliberation'>Deliberation</a> and good <a href='#Conduct'>Conduct</a>, Sagacity is focused on finding <a href='#Truth'>Truth</a> regarding human <a href='#Nature'>Nature</a> and human <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a>. Thus its opposites are ignorance and sophistry about the <a href='#Good'>Good</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Theoretical Wisdom.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Self-Indulgence'><strong>Self-Indulgence</strong> translates <em>akrasia</em> (ἀκρασία). The self-indulgent or unrestrained person has some <a href='#Knowledge'>Knowledge</a> of human <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a> and the <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a> <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>, but that Knowledge is frequently overruled by momentary <a href='#Want'>Wants</a> to indulge in ignoble <a href='#Conduct'>Conduct</a> and <a href='#Emotion'>Emotions</a>, at least in some domains of life. Although this kind of person has not descended into <a href='#Corruption'>Corruption</a> or <a href='#Decadence'>Decadence</a>, they don't have a consistent <a href='#Conduct'>Conduct</a> of <a href='#Correct'>Correct</a> Conduct and Emotion, and thus doesn't experience inner harmony. [Traditionally rendered as Incontinence.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Self-Restraint'><strong>Self-Restraint</strong> translates <em>enkrateia</em> (ἐγκράτεια). The self-restrained person has a fairly complete <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> of human <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a> and the <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a> <a href='Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>, and uses that understanding to override momentary <a href='#Want'>Wants</a> to indulge in ignoble <a href='#Conduct'>Conduct</a> and <a href='#Emotion'>Emotions</a>, at least in some domains of life. This kind of person takes <a href='#Correct'>Correct</a> <a href='#Conduct'>Conduct</a> (in contrast to the <a href='#Self-Indulgence'>Self-Induglent</a> person) but doesn't have consistently <a href='#Correct'>Correct</a> <a href='#Emotion'>Emotions</a>, and thus doesn't always experience inner harmony. [Traditionally rendered as Continence.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Serious'><strong>Serious</strong> translates <em>spoudaios</em> (σπουδαῖος). The completely <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> person who takes life seriously has a thorough <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> of human <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a> and the <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a> <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>, and also has a settled <a href='#Commitment'>Commitment</a> to consistently apply that understanding in their <a href='#Conduct'>Conduct</a> and <a href='#Emotion'>Emotions</a>. As a result, this kind of person reliably experiences inner harmony and represents a <a href='#Standard'>Standard</a> for <a href='#Wisdom'>Wisdom</a> and the <a href='#Good'>Good</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Good.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Skill'><strong>Skill</strong> translates <em>technē</em> (τέχνη). Aristotle often compares the person of great <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> to skilled practitioners such as carpenters, doctors, musicians, and archers. These respective <a href='#Trait'>Traits</a> are all acquired and perfected in similar ways, but have one crucial difference: a Skill can be used for <a href='#Good'>Good</a> or for <a href='#Bad'>Bad</a>, but a <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> can be used only for Good. [Traditionally rendered as Art.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Social'><strong>Social</strong> translates <em>politikē</em> (πολιτική). Although it is characteristic of humans to live in a town or city (a polis), Aristotle identified a wide variety of social animals and was especially impressed with social insects like ants and honeybees. All such creatures live in societies that have a common <a href='#Purpose'>Purpose</a> on which they collaborate in different ways. For other animals this goal is mere <a href='#Life'>Life</a>, but for humans it is living well or <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a>, which involves highly sophisticated forms of social interaction that give rise to both political <a href='#Deliberation'>Deliberation</a> and philosophical <a href='#Inquiry'>Inquiry</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Political.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Standard'><strong>Standard</strong> translates <em>horos</em> (ὅρος). The Standard of what is <a href='#Good'>Good</a>, <a href='#Enjoyment'>Enjoyable</a>, <a href='#Valuable'>Valuable</a>, etc., is not a strict rule as in modern ethical theories (e.g., "the greatest good for the greatest number" in utilitarianism) but the <em>person</em> who has achieved <a href='#Complete'>Complete</a> <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> and <a href='#Wisdom'>Wisdom</a> in their <a href='#Conduct'>Conduct</a> and <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Rule.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Target'><strong>Target</strong> translates <em>skopos</em> (σκοπός). Aristotle often uses analogies from archery to describe important aspects of human life. For example, <a href='#Thrivings'>Thrivings</a> of <a href='#Character'>Character</a> help us avoid "missing the mark". He also counsels us to aim at the <a href='#Purpose'>Purpose</a> or <a href='#Task'>Task</a> of the human <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a> as the specific Target of all our <a href='#Conduct'>Conduct</a> and <a href='#Commitment'>Commitments</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Task'><strong>Task</strong> translates <em>ergon</em> (ἔργον). In his biological research, Aristotle thought it was important to identify the contributions of particular parts of the body to the organism's overall <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>: the eyes for seeing, the feet for moving, the hands for grasping, etc. By extension, every living thing has a Task that consists of its characteristic <a href='#Activity'>Activities</a>; for human beings, this is activity in accordance with <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a> and <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Function.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Thinking'><strong>Thinking</strong> translates <em>logos</em> (λόγος). Human life is saturated with language and the thinking that lies behind language. These phenomena, two sides of the same coin, are the core meanings of the multifaceted Greek word logos. Thinking in the widest sense is the distinctive mode of <a href='#Awareness'>Awareness</a> for human beings; specific applications and developments of Thinking include <a href='#Inquiry'>Inquiry</a>, <a href='#Deliberation'>Deliberation</a>, <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a>, <a href='#Insight'>Insight</a>, <a href='#Wisdom'>Wisdom</a>, and <a href='#Sagacity'>Sagacity</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Reason.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Thriving'><strong>Thriving</strong> translates <em>aretē</em> (ἀρετή). Thriving has biological roots in <a href='#Life'>Life</a> and <a href='#Social'>Social</a> roots in the human <a href='Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>. Building on the Homeric verb ἀρετάω (to prosper, to fare well), I turn the infinitive of the English verb "to thrive" into a noun, so that we can speak of, say, generosity as a Thriving of <a href='#Character'>Character</a>. Every Thriving is <a href='#Trait'>Trait</a> that finds the <a href='#Balance-Point'>Balance-Point</a> between falling short or going too far in a specific domain of life: courage between cowardice and rashness, generosity between stinginess and profligacy, and so on. [Traditionally rendered as Virtue.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Trait'><strong>Trait</strong> translates <em>hexis</em> (ἕξις). A Trait builds upon one or more human <a href='#Capacity'>Capacities</a> to establish a stable and well-developed pattern of <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a>. All <a href='#Thriving'>Thrivings</a> of <a href='#Character'>Character</a> and <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a> are Traits, but not all Traits are <a href='#Thrivings'>Thrivings</a> - for example, both <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> and <a href='#Insight'>Insight</a> are Traits, as are all of the various <a href='#Skill'>Skills</a> that one might acquire in life. All of these Traits are acquired and improved through instruction, correction, active use, and reflection on that use. [Traditionally rendered as Habit.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Truth'><strong>Truth</strong> translates <em>alētheia</em> (ἀλήθεια). Truth is the <a href='#Purpose'>Purpose</a> of all <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a>. To grasp truth (aletheia) is to lack (a-) forgetting (lethe) and thus to have steadfast <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> and <a href='#Awareness'>Awareness</a> of the world or some aspect thereof.
