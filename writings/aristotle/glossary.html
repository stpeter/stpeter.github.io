<p>One reason people find it difficult to understand Aristotle's conception of human fulfillment is that, I feel, translators often miss the mark in rendering his key concepts into English. I've spent many years pondering how to let the original Greek sense of Aristotle's thinking shine through, and I often do so by avoiding Latinate words and instead rendering Greek terms using plain English words that have Anglo-Saxon roots. Although many of my renderings are non-standard, they are intended to give the reader a fresh perspective on Aristotle's ideas; more traditional renderings are mentioned for purposes of comparison.</p>
<ul>
  <li><p id='Activity'><strong>Activity</strong> translates <em>energeia</em> (ἐνέργεια). This is perhaps the most important concept in Aristotle's account of human <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a>. Its core meaning is being engaged in working at a <a href='#Task'>Task</a>, which is why translator Joe Sachs rendered it as "being-at-work". Aristotle repeatedly points out that it's not good enough to be <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> in your <a href='#Character'>Character</a> and <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a>, if that means merely having a <a href='#Trait'>Trait</a> but not using and applying it in your <a href='#Doing'>Doings</a> and <a href='#Feeling'>Feelings</a> (after all, even someone who is asleep can <em>have</em> a trait). In short, <a href='#Life'>Life</a> simply <em>is</em> activity. [Traditionally rendered as Actuality.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Aliveness'><strong>Aliveness</strong> translates <em>psuchē</em> (ψυχή). Aliveness is what animates a living being, what makes it a living thing, what gives form to the <a href='#Activity'>Activities</a> that make up its <a href='#Life'>Life</a>. The specifics of an organism's Aliveness are <a href='#Inherent'>Inherent</a> in its <a href='#Nature'>Nature</a> and its characteristic <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Soul.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Awareness'><strong>Awareness</strong> translates <em>theōria</em> (θεωρία). At root, the <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a> that mostly starkly separates humans and other animals from plants and inanimate objects is their keen awareness of the world around them. For the other animals, this takes the form of the <a href='#Capacity'>Capacity</a> for perceptual awareness (<em>aisthesis</em>), including some amount of memory, imagination, and foresight. To this humans add <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a> and a full range of symbolic faculties, such as speech, recollection, planning, and culture &mdash; all of which are built upon the foundation of conceptual awareness (<em>theoria</em>). Most intensively, human awareness arises when we actively use and apply our <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> of ourselves and the world around us, in the <a href='#Activity'>Activities</a> of ethical <a href='#Doing'>Doing</a> and intellectual <a href='#Inquiry'>Inquiry</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Contemplation.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Bad'><strong>Bad</strong> translates <em>kakos</em> (κακός). Similar to the <a href='#Good'>Good</a>, what's Bad is what is actually (not apparently) detrimental, harmful, or damaging to a living organism, which in practice means anything that impedes it from successfully pursuing its <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Evil.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Balance-Point'><strong>Balance-Point</strong> translates <em>meson</em> (μέσον). All <a href='#Thriving'>Thrivings</a> of <a href='#Character'>Character</a> and <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a> avoid excesses in our <a href='#Doing'>Doings</a> and <a href='#Feeling'>Feelings</a>, whether falling short or going beyond what is <a href='#Fitting'>Fitting</a> or <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a>. When we hit the <a href='#Target'>Target</a>, we've reached a Balance-Point that is worth savoring and beholding. [Traditionally rendered as the Mean.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Beautifully-Right'><strong>Beautifully Right</strong> translates <em>kalos</em> (καλός). The Greek word <em>kalos</em> straddles the line between ethics and aesthetics: it can mean beautiful, fine, right, noble, and so on. Rendering it as "beautifully right" does justice to both of these aspects. All of the <a href='#Thriving'>Thrivings</a> of <a href='#Character'>Character</a> are done for the benefit (the <a href='#Good'>Good</a>) of the individual and with the aim of doing what is Beautifully Right. [Traditionally rendered as Noble.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Capacity'><strong>Capacity</strong> translates <em>dunamis</em> (δύναμις). All living things have bodily parts that afford the ability to engage in certain <a href='#Activity'>Activities</a>, such as seeing, hearing, walking, flying, swimming, grazing, hunting, finding shelter, building nests, remembering things, and using tools. In humans, the range of Capacities widens considerably to include <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a>, language, planning, mastering <a href='#Craft'>Crafts</a>, and so on &mdash; all of which provide a foundation for individual and societal development, interpersonal relationships, personal <a href='#Trait'>Traits</a>, and human <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Potentiality.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Character'><strong>Character</strong> translates <em>ēthos</em> (ἦθος). A person's Character consists of the stable set of qualities of <a href='#Doing'>Doing</a> and <a href='#Feeling'>Feeling</a> that informs their <a href='#Commitment'>Commitments</a> and establishes the aim of their <a href='#Deliberation'>Deliberations</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Commitment'><strong>Commitment</strong> translates <em>prohairesis</em> (προαίρεσις). A Commitment is a reliable preference for one pattern of <a href='#Doing'>Doing</a> over another. Such a Commitment is much more powerful and thoroughgoing than a decision to take a particular action in a particular situation, because it shapes the form of all of your decisions and actions. This is why a <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> of <a href='#Character'>Character</a> is a <a href='#Trait'>Trait</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Decision.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Complete'><strong>Complete</strong> translates <em>teleia</em> (τελεία). A living organism is Complete when it has fully developed and matured in accordance with its <a href='#Nature'>Nature</a> and <a href='#Purpose'>Purpose</a>. For humans, these processes can include ever-deepening improvement in <a href='#Character'>Character</a> and <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> and thus can continue throughout a person's lifespan. [Traditionally rendered as Perfect.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Completion'><strong>Completion</strong> translates <em>entelecheia</em> (ἐντελέχεια). Completion is the state of having fully developed the full range of <a href='#Capacity'>Capacities</a> consistent with one's <a href='#Nature'>Nature</a>, and by extension actually exercising the full range of <a href='#Activity'>Activities</a> made possible by having become fully developed. [Traditionally rendered as Actuality.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Correct'><strong>Correct</strong> translates <em>orthos</em> (ὀρθός). Correct <a href='#Doing'>Doing</a> and <a href='#Feeling'>Feeling</a> finds the active <a href='#Truth'>Truth</a> in particular situations and takes a straight path to the <a href='#Target'>Target</a> of a person's <a href='#Commitment'>Commitments</a>. The term is most common in the Greek phrase <em>orthos logos</em>: the Correct <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a> that underlies Correct Doing and Feeling in a given domain of life. [Traditionally rendered as Right.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Corruption'><strong>Corruption</strong> translates <em>mochthēria</em> (μοχθηρία). Corruption is the opposite of <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a>. The thoroughly corrupted person has no <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> of human <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a> and the <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a> <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>, and therefore consistently engages in <a href='#Bad'>Bad</a> or <a href='#Repulsively-Wrong'>Repulsively Wrong</a> <a href='#Doing'>Doings</a> and <a href='#Feeling'>Feelings</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Vice.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Craft'><strong>Craft</strong> translates <em>technē</em> (τέχνη). Aristotle often compares the person who achieves great <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> of <a href='#Character'>Character</a> to skilled practitioners such as carpenters, doctors, musicians, and archers. Both Thriving and Craft are <a href='#Trait'>Traits</a> that are acquired and perfected in similar ways, but they have one crucial difference: a Craft can be used for <a href='#Good'>Good</a> or for <a href='#Bad'>Bad</a>, but a <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> can be used only for Good. [Traditionally rendered as Art.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Craftiness'><strong>Craftiness</strong> translates <em>panourgia</em> (πανουργία). Craftiness is one of the opposites of <a href='#Wisdom'>Wisdom</a>: the crafty person has mastered the <a href='#Craft'>Craft</a>-like know-how of practical <a href='#Doing'>Doing</a> without having formed a <a href='#Commitment'>Commitment</a> to what is <a href='#Good'>Good</a> and <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a>. Indeed, for the crafty person even the highest goods are means to unreflective ends like wealth, status, power, and pleasure: <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> and <a href='#Insight'>Insight</a> are not ends in itself as they are for the person of <a href='#Sagacity'>Sagacity</a>, and <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully-Right</a> <a href='#Doing'>Doing</a> and <a href='#Feeling'>Feeling</a> are not ends in themselves as they are for the person of <a href='#Wisdom'>Wisdom</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Craving'><strong>Craving</strong> translates <em>epithumia</em> (ἐπιθυμία) when a felt <a href='#Need'>Need</a> is extreme or unnatural.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Decadence'><strong>Decadence</strong> translates <em>akolasia</em> (ἀκολασία). The decadent person has one policy in life: to pursue immediate pleasure and <a href='#Enjoyment'>Enjoyment</a> without regard to whether or not the <a href='#Activity'>Activities</a> that gives rise to it are <a href='#Inherent'>Inherently</a> <a href='#Good'>Good</a>, <a href='#Serious'>Serious</a>, or <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a>. Indeed, because Decadence is one variety of <a href='#Corruption'>Corruption</a>, the decadent person reliably indulges in the exact opposite: activities that are bad, unworthy, and repulsively wrong.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Deception'><strong>Deception</strong> translates <em>apatē</em> (ἀπάτη). Deception is one of the opposites of <a href='#Sagacity'>Sagacity</a> because the deceptive person lacks <a href='#Commitment'>Commitment</a> to <a href='#Truth'>Truth</a>. Consistent with the Delphic maxim to "Know Thyself", Deception is not limited to sophistry in teaching or politics but often takes the form of self-deception.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Deliberation'><strong>Deliberation</strong> translates <em>bouleusis</em> (βουλεύσις). Deliberation is a reflective form of <a href='#Inquiry'>Inquiry</a> that seeks to determine what is <a href='#Correct'>Correct</a> and <a href='#Truth'>True</a> with regard to <a href='#Doing'>Doings</a> and <a href='#Feeling'>Feelings</a>. The result of Deliberation is a <a href='#Resolution'>Resolution</a> to act or react in a certain way.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Doing'><strong>Doing</strong> translates <em>praxis</em> (πρᾶξις). Doing is an overall practice or pattern of practical <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a> and thus more significant than any particular action one might take. Because Doing is based in <a href='#Deliberation'>Deliberation</a> and <a href='#Commitment'>Commitment</a>, it is something that animals cannot attain and that even human beings must grow into as they mature. Doing is pursued for its own sake and thus is often contrasted with <a href='#Making'>Making</a>; it is also often contrasted with <a href='#Feeling'>Feeling</a> because it is something that a person initiates. [Traditionally rendered as Action.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Enjoyment'><strong>Enjoyment</strong> translates <em>hēdonē</em> (ἡδονή). Every kind of <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a> has its own <a href='#Inherent'>Inherent</a> kind of enjoyment: the joys of eating, say, are quite different from the joys of beholding works of art. This is why the <a href='#Standard'>Standard</a> of what's truly enjoyable is the <a href='#Serious'>Serious</a> person of <a href='#Complete'>Complete</a> <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> in both <a href='#Character'>Character</a> and <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Pleasure.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Feeling'><strong>Feeling</strong> translates <em>pathos</em> (πάθος). An Feeling is a mental or emotional state that you undergo because of your interaction with and assessment of things you experience in your environment. Although we tend to think of Feelings as somewhat passive because unlike <a href='#Doing'>Doings</a> we do not initiate them, they still count as a form of <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a>. Because humans are deeply <a href='#Social'>Social</a> creatures, our most salient Feelings are interpersonal, such as anger, sympathy, and affection. Such Feelings are <a href='#Inherent'>Inherently</a> bound up with various <a href='#Thriving'>Thrivings</a>, such as gentleness, compassion, and benevolence. [Traditionally rendered as Passion.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Fitting'><strong>Fitting</strong> translates <em>prepon</em> (πρέπον). What's Fitting is the <a href='#Doing'>Doing</a> or <a href='#Feeling'>Feeling</a> that is admirably appropriate or <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a> in a given situation.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Foolishness'><strong>Foolishness</strong> translates the interchangeable terms <em>euētheia</em> (εὐήθεια) and <em>aphrosunē</em> (ἀφροσύνη). Foolishness is one of the opposites of <a href='#Wisdom'>Wisdom</a>: the foolish person might have a vague <a href='#Commitment'>Commitment</a> to what is <a href='#Good'>Good</a> and <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a>, but lacks the <a href='#Craft'>Craft</a>-like know-how of practical <a href='#Doing'>Doing</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Freedom'><strong>Freedom</strong> translates <em>eleutheria</em> (ἐλευθερία). For the ancient Greeks, the highest freedom was not freedom from government but freedom from toil, strife, warfighting, and in general from the yoke of all-encompassing necessity. This state of peace, ease, and <a href='#Leisure'>Leisure</a> freed them up for <a href='#Activity'>Activities</a> that celebrate <a href='#Life'>Life</a> and are <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a>, such as love and friendship, games and festivals, music, dramatic performances, artistic appreciation, intelligent conversation, scientific inquiry, and philosophical speculation.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Fulfillment'><strong>Fulfillment</strong> translates <em>eudaimonia</em> (εὐδαιμονία). The first level of Fulfillment is the activation of all of your core human <a href='#Capacity'>Capacities</a> by developing the full range of <a href='#Thriving'>Thrivings</a> of <a href='#Character'>Character</a> and <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a>. The second level is the <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a> of applying those Thrivings to the practice of living well, i.e., demonstrating a reliable <a href='#Commitment'>Commitment</a> to <a href='#Doing'>Doings</a> and <a href='#Feeling'>Feelings</a> that are <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a>. Becoming a fully developed person makes your life <a href='#Complete'>Complete</a>, <a href='#Wholeness'>Whole</a>, and uniquely <a href='#Valuable'>Valuable</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Happiness.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Good'><strong>Good</strong> translates <em>agathos</em> (ἀγαθός). Whereas most religions and modern ethical theories assert that the Good must conform to some pre-established rule, for Aristotle the Good is what benefits a living organism or person: not what merely <em>seems</em> to be beneficial, but what <em>is</em> truly beneficial in accordance with a being's <a href='#Nature'>Nature</a>, <a href='#Identity'>Identity</a>, <a href='#Task'>Task</a>, and <a href='#Purpose'>Purpose</a> (indeed, these terms are virtually synonymous). Thus <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a> is primarily objective, not subjective.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Humaneness'><strong>Humaneness</strong> translates <em>epieikeia</em> (ἐπιείκεια). The Greek term <em>epieikeia</em> is used in several senses, but the primary sense refers to a special aspect of <a href='#Justice'>Justice</a> that applies and adapts general principles to the particulars of a given situation; it is thus a kind of proto-<a href='#Wisdom'>Wisdom</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Decency.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Identity'><strong>Identity</strong> translates <em>to ti ēn einai</em> (τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι). Literally, this phrase means "what it is to be a thing". The Romans translated it as "essentia", which was modernized as "essence", thus leading to all sorts of confusion about independently existing essences. Aristotle's idea is much more straightforward, and is most reasonably Englished as "identity". [Traditionally rendered as Essence.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Ignorance'><strong>Ignorance</strong> translates <em>agnoia</em> (ἄγνοια). Ignorance is one of the opposites of <a href='#Sagacity'>Sagacity</a> because the Ignorant person lacks <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> of the human <a href='#Good'>Good</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Impasse'><strong>Impasse</strong> translates <em>aporia</em> (ἀπορία). You face an Impasse in when you are blocked from achieving the <a href='#Purpose'>Purposes</a> of <a href='#Truth'>Truth</a> or <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a>. This kind of predicament can spur you to engage in intellectual <a href='#Inquiry'>Inquiry</a> or practical <a href='#Deliberation'>Deliberation</a> so that you can clear away the confusion and move toward the <a href='#Target'>Target</a> of <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a> or <a href='#Doing'>Doing</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Puzzle.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Indulgence'><strong>Indulgence</strong> translates <em>thumos</em> (θυμός) when a <a href='#Want'>Want</a> is extreme or unnatural.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Inherent'><strong>Inherent</strong> translates <em>oikeios</em> (οἰκεῖος). The Greek word <em>oikeios</em> derives from their word for home, and thus connotes that which is close to home, native as opposed to foreign, familiar as opposed to strange, inner as opposed to outer, and that which is innately bound up with the nature of a thing. A good example is the intimate tie between an <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a> and the <a href='#Enjoyment'>Enjoyment</a> that makes it <a href='#Complete'>Completes</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Proper.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Inquiry'><strong>Inquiry</strong> translates <em>zētēsis</em> (ζήτησις). Inquiry is the <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a> of seeking <a href='#Truth'>Truth</a>, whether in a purely intellectual pursuit or in the form of action-oriented <a href='#Deliberation'>Deliberation</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Insight'><strong>Insight</strong> translates <em>nous</em> (νοῦς). Whereas <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> goes deep to elucidate the factors responsible for the <a href='#Identity'>Identity</a> common to all entities that share a <a href='#Nature'>Nature</a>, Insight is the <a href='#Trait'>Trait</a> of <em>seeing</em> that underlying Identity <em>in</em> the particular entities and situations you encounter in intellectual <a href='#Inquiry'>Inquiry</a> and practical <a href='#Doing'>Doing</a>. Just as the <a href='#Inherent'>Inherent</a> <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a> of <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> is explaining why something is the way it is, so the <a href='#Inherent'>Inherent</a> <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a> of Insight is calling in the particulars as witnesses to the <a href='#Nature'>Nature</a> of the phenomenon under consideration. [Traditionally rendered as Mind or Intuition.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Justice'><strong>Justice</strong> translates <em>dikaiosunē</em> (δικαιοσύνη). Justice is a capstone <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> of <a href='#Character'>Character</a>, since consists in the <a href='#Complete'>Complete</a> <a href='#Practice'>Practice</a> of <a href='#Complete'>Complete</a> <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> in relation to other people.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Knowledge'><strong>Knowledge</strong> translates <em>gnōsis</em> (γνῶσις). There are several forms of Knowledge, including perception and <a href='#Insight'>Insight</a>. <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> imparts greater generality to such Knowledge by explaining why the things you know are the way they are. Of all the forms of knowledge, the most difficult to attain is self-knowledge, because human beings are their own greatest enigma; yet knowing yourself is the only reliable path to <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Leisure'><strong>Leisure</strong> translates <em>scholē</em> (σχολή). We moderns think of leisure as the relatively brief episodes between longer stretches of work, or as the golden years of fun and relaxation after retirement from a career; for us work is fundamental and leisure is the absence of work. By contrast, for the ancient Greeks (or at least members of the aristocracy) scholē was fundamental and work was <em>ascholia</em>: the absence of leisure. Scholē is the <a href='#Purpose'>Purpose</a> of people who live in <a href='#Freedom'>Freedom</a> and is to be spent not in frivolous amusements but in <a href='#Serious'>Serious</a> pursuits like artistic appreciation, intellectual inquiry, and philosophical speculation.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Life'><strong>Life</strong> translates <em>zōē</em> (ζωή). Ancient Greek had two words for life: <em>zōē</em> (whence zoology) and <em>bios</em> (whence biology). The former signifies the life <a href='#Activity'>Activities</a> of any living thing, whereas the latter signifies the <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a> of an organism, especially of animals and humans.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Love'><strong>Love</strong> translates <em>philia</em> (φιλία). The Greek word <em>philia</em> covers a wide range of close personal relationships, including the love and affection of parents, children, siblings, spouses, friends, even fellow citizens. The highest form of philia is rooted in the good <a href='#Character'>Character</a> of those involved in the relationship and provides a fertile field for applying all the <a href='#Thriving'>Thrivings</a> of <a href='#Character'>Character</a> and <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a> through the many <a href='#Activity'>Activities</a> of a shared life. [Traditionally rendered as Friendship.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Making'><strong>Making</strong> translates <em>poiēsis</em> (ποίησις). Making is the kind of <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a> associated with a <a href='#Craft'>Craft</a>. It is often contrasted with <a href='#Doing'>Doing</a>, since the <a href='#Purpose'>Purpose</a> of a Craft lies outside itself in the thing or state that is produced, whereas the Purpose of a Doing is <a href='#Inherent'>Inherent</a> in itself and it is pursued for its own sake.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Misery'><strong>Misery</strong> translates <em>athliotēs</em> (ἀθλιότης). Misery is the opposite of <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a>, but like its opposite it should be understood as a description more of a person's objective state and less of their subjective emotions. The miserable person has not activated their <a href='#Capacity'>Capacities</a>, does not guide their <a href='#Doing'>Doings</a> and <a href='#Feelings'>Feelings</a> by <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a> or a <a href='#Commitment'>Commitment</a> to the <a href='#Good'>Good</a>, tends toward <a href='#Corruption'>Corruption</a> and <a href='#Decadence'>Decadence</a>, and therefore lacks the inner harmony that is characteristic of the person who takes life <a href='#Serious'>Seriously</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Moderation'><strong>Moderation</strong> translates <em>sōphrosunē</em> (σωφροσύνη). Although Aristotle never said to pursue "moderation in everything", Moderation is still the best way to render the multifaceted Greek word <em>sōphrosunē</em>. This <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> of <a href='#Character'>Character</a> implies an ability to temper your <a href='#Feeling'>Feelings</a>, to keep your head in difficult situations, to avoid excess, and to honor the Delphic maxim "Nothing To Excess"; its opposite is <a href='#Decadence'>Decadence</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Temperance.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Nature'><strong>Nature</strong> translates <em>phusis</em> (φύσις). A living thing's Nature is the full range of <a href='#Capacity'>Capacities</a> and <a href='#Activity'>Activities</a> that it grows into (Greek <em>phuein</em>) through its years of development and, for humans, <a href='#Upbringing'>Upbringing</a> and maturation.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Need'><strong>Need</strong> translates <em>epithumia</em> (ἐπιθυμία). Of the three kinds of <a href='#Reaching'>Reaching</a>, Need is the most basic. Even plants have needs for sunlight, water, air, and nutrients in the earth, which enable them to live, grow, and reproduce. Although animals and humans experience more advanced levels of <a href='#Awareness'>Awareness</a> and thus have <a href='#Want'>Wants</a> and (for humans) <a href='#Resolution'>Resolutions</a> to action, they too have inescapable Needs that are <a href='#Inherent'>Inherent</a> in the processes of <a href='#Life'>Life</a>. When a felt Need is extreme or unnatural, I translate the word <em>epithumia</em> as <a href='#Obsession'>Obsession</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Appetite.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Obsession'><strong>Obsession</strong> translates <em>boulēsis</em> (βούλησις) when a <a href='#Resolution'>Resolution</a> is extreme or unnatural.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Practice'><strong>Practice</strong> translates <em>chrēsis</em> (χρῆσις). This is the use, exercise, or application of a <a href='#Capacity'>Capacity</a> or <a href='#Trait'>Trait</a> in a person's <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a> or <a href='#Doing'>Doing</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Purpose'><strong>Purpose</strong> translates <em>telos</em> (τέλος). Every living organism serves a Purpose: not some cosmic end or something that benefits other beings, but its own <a href='#Activity'>Activities</a> that it pursues in accordance with its <a href='#Nature'>Nature</a> and <a href='#Inherent'>Inherent</a> <a href='#Task'>Task</a>. [Traditionally rendered as End.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Reaching'><strong>Reaching</strong> translates <em>orexis</em> (ὄρεξις). All living organisms reach out into the world to achieve <a href='#Purpose'>Purposes</a> such as metabolism, growth, and reproduction. For Aristotle, there are three kinds of reaching: <a href='#Need'>Needs</a> (evident even in plants), <a href='#Want'>Wants</a> (which emerge with <a href='#Awareness'>Awareness</a> and locomotion in animals), and <a href='#Resolution'>Resolution</a> (which results from <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a>, <a href='#Deliberation'>Deliberation</a>, and <a href='#Commitment'>Commitment</a> in humans). [Traditionally rendered as Desire.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Repulsively-Wrong'><strong>Repulsively Wrong</strong> translates <em>aischros</em> (αἰσχρός). This term is the exact opposite of <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a> and captures several senses, describing <a href='#Doing'>Doings</a> and <a href='#Feeling'>Feelings</a> that are wrong, ugly, or ignoble. [Traditionally rendered as Shameful.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Resolution'><strong>Resolution</strong> translates <em>boulēsis</em> (βούλησις). Beyond <a href='#Need'>Needs</a> and <a href='#Want'>Wants</a>, humans can resolve to take action based on their <a href='#Deliberation'>Deliberations</a> about the future. The close connection between Deliberation and Resolution can be seen in their Greek roots: <em>bouleusis</em> or taking counsel leads to <em>boulēsis</em> or forming a resolution. Because Deliberation is an action-oriented form of <a href='#Inquiry'>Inquiry</a>, Resolution is bound up with <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a> and conceptual <a href='#Awareness'>Awareness</a>; because the <a href='#Commitment'>Commitment</a> that produces a Resolution is part and parcel of practical <a href='#Doing'>Doing</a>, Resolution is bound up with <a href='#Character'>Character</a> and acquired <a href='#Trait'>Traits</a>. When a Resolution is extreme or unnatural, I translate the word <em>boulēsis</em> as <a href='#Obsession'>Obsession</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Wish.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Sagacity'><strong>Sagacity</strong> translates <em>sophia</em> (σοφία). Sagacity combines a deep <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> of existence (especially human <a href='#Nature'>Nature</a> and the human <a href='#Good'>Good</a>) with a deep <a href='#Commitment'>Commitment</a> to seeking <a href='#Truth'>Truth</a> and living an examined life. Its opposites are <a href='#Ignorance'>Ignorance</a> (which lacks that Understanding) and <a href='#Deception'>Deception</a> (which lacks that Commitment). Sagacity differs from <a href='#Wisdom'>Wisdom</a> in that Wisdom is focused on <a href='#Good'>Good</a> <a href='#Deliberation'>Deliberation</a> that leads to <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a> <a href='#Doing'>Doing</a> and <a href='#Feeling'>Feeling</a>, whereas Sagacity is focused on <a href='#Correct'>Correct</a> <a href='#Inquiry'>Inquiry</a> that leads to <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> and <a href='#Insight'>Insight</a> purely for the sake of knowing. [Traditionally rendered as Theoretical Wisdom.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Self-Indulgence'><strong>Self-Indulgence</strong> translates <em>akrasia</em> (ἀκρασία). The self-indulgent or unrestrained person has an incomplete <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> of human <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a> and the <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a> <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>, but even that limited Understanding is frequently overruled by <a href='#Indulgence'>Indulgences</a> to engage in <a href='#Bad'>Bad</a> or <a href='#Repulsively-Wrong'>Repulsively Wrong</a> <a href='#Doing'>Doings</a> and <a href='#Feeling'>Feelings</a>, at least in some domains of life. Although this kind of person has not descended into <a href='#Corruption'>Corruption</a> or <a href='#Decadence'>Decadence</a>, they don't have a consistent practice of <a href='#Good'>Good</a> or <a href='#Correct'>Correct</a> Doing and Feeling, and thus don't experience inner harmony. Self-Indulgence is better than <a href='#Decadence'>Decadence</a> or some other form of <a href='#Corruption'>Corruption</a>, but suffers by contrast with <a href='#Self-Restraint'>Self-Restraint</a> and especially with the <a href='#Complete'>Complete</a> <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> of the <a href='#Serious'>Serious</a> person. [Traditionally rendered as Incontinence.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Self-Restraint'><strong>Self-Restraint</strong> translates <em>enkrateia</em> (ἐγκράτεια). The self-restrained person has a fairly complete <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> of human <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a> and the <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a> <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>, and uses that understanding to override any momentary <a href='#Indulgence'>Indulgences</a> to engage in <a href='#Bad'>Bad</a> or <a href='#Repulsively-Wrong'>Repulsively Wrong</a> <a href='#Doing'>Doing</a>. This kind of person engages in <a href='#Correct'>Correct</a> <a href='#Doing'>Doing</a> (in contrast to the <a href='#Self-Indulgence'>Self-Indulgent</a> person) but doesn't have consistently <a href='#Good'>Good</a> or <a href='#Correct'>Correct</a> <a href='#Feeling'>Feelings</a> as does the <a href='#Serious'>Serious</a> person of <a href='#Complete'>Complete</a> <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a>, and thus doesn't always experience inner harmony. [Traditionally rendered as Continence.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Serious'><strong>Serious</strong> translates <em>spoudaios</em> (σπουδαῖος). The completely <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> person who takes life seriously has a thorough <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> of human <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a> and the <a href='#Beautifully-Right'>Beautifully Right</a> <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>, and also has a settled <a href='#Commitment'>Commitment</a> to consistently apply that understanding in their <a href='#Doing'>Doings</a> and <a href='#Feeling'>Feelings</a>. As a result, this kind of highly worthy person reliably experiences inner harmony and even represents a <a href='#Standard'>Standard</a> for <a href='#Wisdom'>Wisdom</a> and the <a href='#Good'>Good</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Good.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Social'><strong>Social</strong> translates <em>politikē</em> (πολιτική). Although it is characteristic of humans to live in a town or city (in Greek, a <em>polis</em>), Aristotle identified a wide variety of social animals and was especially impressed with social insects like ants and honeybees. All such creatures live in societies that have a common <a href='#Purpose'>Purpose</a> on which they collaborate in different ways. For other animals this goal is mere <a href='#Life'>Life</a>, but for humans it is living well or <a href='#Fulfillment'>Fulfillment</a>, which involves highly sophisticated forms of social interaction that give rise to both political <a href='#Deliberation'>Deliberation</a> and philosophical <a href='#Inquiry'>Inquiry</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Political.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Standard'><strong>Standard</strong> translates <em>horos</em> (ὅρος). The Standard of what is <a href='#Good'>Good</a>, <a href='#Enjoyment'>Enjoyable</a>, <a href='#Valuable'>Valuable</a>, etc., is not a strict rule as in modern ethical theories (e.g., "the greatest good for the greatest number" in utilitarianism) but the <em>person</em> who has achieved <a href='#Complete'>Complete</a> <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> and <a href='#Wisdom'>Wisdom</a> in their <a href='#Doing'>Doing</a> and <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Rule.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Target'><strong>Target</strong> translates <em>skopos</em> (σκοπός). Aristotle often uses analogies from archery to describe central aspects of human experienc (e.g., <a href='#Thrivings'>Thrivings</a> of <a href='#Character'>Character</a> help us avoid "missing the mark"). He also counsels us to aim at the <a href='#Purpose'>Purpose</a> or <a href='#Task'>Task</a> of the human <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a> as the specific Target of all our <a href='#Doing'>Doings</a> and <a href='#Commitment'>Commitments</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Task'><strong>Task</strong> translates <em>ergon</em> (ἔργον). In his biological inquiries, Aristotle thought it was important to identify the contributions of particular parts of the body to the organism's overall <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>: the eyes for seeing, the feet for moving, the hands for grasping, etc. By extension, every living thing has a Task that consists of its characteristic <a href='#Activity'>Activities</a>; for human beings, this is activity in accordance with <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a> and ethical <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Function.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Thinking'><strong>Thinking</strong> translates <em>logos</em> (λόγος). Human life is saturated with language and the Thinking that lies behind language. These phenomena, two sides of the same coin, are the core meanings of the multifaceted Greek word <em>logos</em>. Thinking in the widest sense is the distinctive mode of <a href='#Awareness'>Awareness</a> for human beings; specific applications and developments of Thinking include <a href='#Inquiry'>Inquiry</a>, <a href='#Deliberation'>Deliberation</a>, <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a>, <a href='#Insight'>Insight</a>, <a href='#Wisdom'>Wisdom</a>, and <a href='#Sagacity'>Sagacity</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Reason.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Thriving'><strong>Thriving</strong> translates <em>aretē</em> (ἀρετή). Thriving has biological roots in <a href='#Life'>Life</a> and <a href='#Social'>Social</a> roots in the human <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>. Building on the Homeric verb ἀρετάω (to prosper, to fare well), I turn the infinitive of the English verb "to thrive" into a noun, so that we can speak of, say, generosity as a Thriving of <a href='#Character'>Character</a>. Every Thriving is a <a href='#Trait'>Trait</a> that finds the <a href='#Balance-Point'>Balance-Point</a> between falling short or going too far in a specific domain of life: courage between cowardice and rashness, generosity between stinginess and profligacy, and so on. [Traditionally rendered as Virtue.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Trait'><strong>Trait</strong> translates <em>hexis</em> (ἕξις). A Trait builds upon one or more human <a href='#Capacity'>Capacities</a> to establish a stable and well-developed pattern of <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a>. All <a href='#Thriving'>Thrivings</a> of <a href='#Character'>Character</a> and <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a> are Traits, but not all Traits are <a href='#Thrivings'>Thrivings</a> &mdash; for example, both <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> and <a href='#Insight'>Insight</a> are Traits, as are all of the various <a href='#Craft'>Crafts</a> that human beings have developed. All of these Traits are acquired and improved through instruction, correction, use, and reflection. [Traditionally rendered as Habit.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Truth'><strong>Truth</strong> translates <em>alētheia</em> (ἀλήθεια). Truth is the <a href='#Purpose'>Purpose</a> of all <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a>. To grasp truth (aletheia) is to lack (a-) forgetting (lethe) and thus to have steadfast <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> and <a href='#Awareness'>Awareness</a> of the world or some aspect thereof. The only way do this is to engage in the <a href='#Activity'>Activity</a> of applying your <a href='#Understanding'>Understanding</a> of things, both in intellectual <a href='#Inquiry'>Inquiry</a> and in practical <a href='#Doing'>Doing</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Understanding'><strong>Understanding</strong> translates <em>epistēmē</em> (ἐπιστήμη). To know something in the deepest sense is to understand how to explain why it is the way it is. This is a tall order, for a thing's <a href='#Identity'>Identity</a> includes its <a href='#Nature'>Nature</a>, its <a href='#Capacity'>Capacities</a>, its <a href='#Way-of-Being'>Way of Being</a> (and for living things its <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>), and the multifarious factors responsible for these phenomena. Once acquired, this kind of Understanding becomes firmly rooted in your mind as a <a href='#Trait'>Trait</a> of grasping <a href='#Truth'>Truth</a> and thus establishes a foundation for <a href='#Wisdom'>Wisdom</a> and <a href='#Sagacity'>Sagacity</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Knowledge.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Upbringing'><strong>Upbringing</strong> translates <em>ethismos</em> (ἐθισμός). Upbringing is the process of learning, as a child and adolescent, the social customs that provide a foundation for fully developing the <a href='#Trait'>Traits</a> of <a href='#Character'>Character</a> and <a href='#Thinking'>Thinking</a> as an adult. [Traditionally rendered as Habituation.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Valuable'><strong>Valuable</strong> translates <em>haireta</em> (αἱρετά). What's Valuable are the <a href='#Activity'>Activities</a> that are worth pursuing in life (the term is nearly synonymous with the <a href='#Good'>Good</a>). A life that is full of such Activities is <a href='#Serious'>Serious</a> and eminently <em>worth living</em>. [Traditionally rendered as Choiceworthy.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Want'><strong>Want</strong> translates <em>thumos</em> (θυμός). Beyond the basic <a href='#Need'>Needs</a> of all living things, animals also have Wants, which arise because animals have <a href='#Capacity'>Capacities</a> both for perceptual <a href='#Awareness'>Awareness</a> and for movement in place. Thus animals can pursue things they perceive as <a href='#Good'>Good</a> or beneficial and avoid things they perceive as <a href='#Bad'>Bad</a> or harmful. When a Want is extreme or unnatural, I translate the word <em>thumos</em> as <a href='#Indulgence'>Indulgence</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Spirit.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Way-of-Being'><strong>Way of Being</strong> translates <em>eidos</em> (εἶδος). A thing's Way of Being is its underlying pattern of existence; for humans and other animals this is the organism's <a href='#Way-of-Life'>Way of Life</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Form.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Way-of-Life'><strong>Way of Life</strong> translates <em>bios</em> (βίος). An animal's Way of Life consists of its characteristic methods of finding food, reproducing, raising its young, acting within its environment, interacting with other members of its species, and the like. In particular, there is a continuum from solitary to highly <a href='#Social'>Social</a> creatures, with human beings at the latter end of the spectrum.</p></li>
  <li><p id='Wholeness'><strong>Wholeness</strong> translates <em>autarkeia</em> (αὐτάρκεια). When your life has Wholeness, it is self-contained and needs nothing else of significance to be considered <a href='#Valuable'>Valuable</a> and <a href='#Complete'>Complete</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Self-Sufficiency.]</p></li>
  <li><p id='Wisdom'><strong>Wisdom</strong> translates <em>phronēsis</em> (φρόνησις). As with every other <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a>, Wisdom is a <a href='#Balance-Point'>Balance-Point</a>, in this case between <a href='#Foolishness'>Foolishness</a> and <a href='#Craftiness'>Craftiness</a>: the wise person combines good judgment with good character, whereas the foolish person lacks good judgment and the crafty person lacks good character. Wisdom plays a special role in unifying your <a href='#Character'>Character</a>, because it is a form of "minding" and <a href='#Deliberation'>Deliberation</a> that helps you discover every other Balance-Point; thus Wisdom is a master <a href='#Thriving'>Thriving</a> in the realm of <a href='#Doing'>Doing</a> and <a href='#Feeling'>Feeling</a>. [Traditionally rendered as Practical Wisdom.]</p></li>
