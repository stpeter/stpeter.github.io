<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p>We praise what's beautiful and blame what's worthless. The thrivings of character are the most prominent of the beautiful things; the failings of character are the most prominent of the worthless things. Also praised are what's responsible for the thrivings, what comes along with them, what brings them into being, and what results from them; also blamed are the opposites of these.</p>
<p>If, following Plato, we hold that personhood has three aspects, then wisdom is a thriving of thinking, mildness and courage are thrivings of wanting, moderation and self-restraint are thrivings of needing, and justice, liberality, and great-heartedness are thrivings of the person overall. Foolishness is a failing of thinking, belligerence and cowardice are failings of wanting, decadence and self-indulgence are failings of needing, and injustice, illiberality, and small-heartedness are failings of the person overall.</p>
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p>Wisdom is a thriving of thinking that procures what conduces to fulfillment. Mildness is a thriving of wanting that makes one disinclined to anger. Courage is a thriving of wanting that makes one resistant to the fear of death. Moderation is a thriving of needing that makes one ungrasping for the enjoyment of worthless pleasures. Self-restraint is a thriving of needing that makes one mindfully resist the craving impulse toward worthless pleasures. Justice is a thriving of personhood that distributes things according to worth. Liberality is a thriving of personhood that spends freely on what's beautiful. Great-heartedness is a thriving of personhood that gives one the power to handle good fortune and bad fortune as well as honor and dishonor.</p>
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p>Foolishness is a failing of thinking that is responsible for bad living. Belligerence is a failing of wanting that makes one easily stirred to anger. Cowardice is a failing of wanting that induces fear, especially the fear of death. Decadence is a failing of needing that causes one to pursue worthless pleasures. Self-indulgence is a failing of needing that drags one unthinkingly to the enjoyment of worthless pleasures. Injustice is a failing of personhood that makes one greedy for things beyond one's worth. Illiberality is a failing of personhood that causes one to grasp after gain from any and every source. Small-heartedness is a failing of personhood that makes one unable to handle good fortune and bad fortune as well as honor and dishonor.</p>
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p>To wisdom belong deliberation, discernment of what is good and bad as well as everything in life that is to be preferred and avoided, beautiful use of all good things, correct keeping of company, taking advantage of the opportune moment, the astute use of words and deeds, and experience regarding everything useful. Memory, experience, and astuteness all arise from wisdom or accompany it. Alternatively some of these might be contributing causes of wisdom, such as memory and experience, while others are aspects of wisdom, such as astuteness and successful deliberation.</p>
<p>To mildness belong the ability to moderately handle assault and contempt, to not rush quickly to retaliation, to not be easily spurred to anger, to not be bitter or contentious in one's character, to maintain one's equilibrium and steadfastness.</p>
<p>To courage belong not being overtaken by fears of death, being bold in fearful situations, being brave in the face of danger, preferring to dying beautifully over saving oneself in an ugly way, and shouldering responsibility for victory. It also belongs to courage to work hard, to demonstrate endurance, and to take things like a man. The things that come along with courage are bravery, high spirits, confidence, audacity, a love of toil, and endurance.</p>
<p>To moderation belong not being fascinated by the enjoyment of bodily pleasures, not grasping after the enjoyment of ugly pleasures, apprehension over justly deserved security, and a well-ordered way of life in matters large and small. Things that come along with moderation are self-discipline, decorum, shame, and caution.</p>
