<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p>We praise what's beautiful and blame is what's worthless. The excellences of character are the most prominent of the beautiful things; the failures of character are the most prominent of the worthless things. Also praised are what's responsible for the excellences, what comes along with them, what brings them into being, and what results from them; also blamed are the opposites of these.</p>
<p>If, following Plato, we hold that the soul has three aspects, then wisdom is an excellence of thinking, mildness and courage are excellences of wanting, moderation and self-restraint are excellences of needing, and justice, liberality, and greatness of soul are excellences of the soul overall. Foolishness is a failure of thinking, belligerence and cowardice are failures of wanting, decadence and self-indulgence are failures of needing, and injustice, illiberality, and smallness of soul are failures of the soul overall.</p>
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p>Wisdom is an excellence of thinking that procures what conduces to fulfillment. Mildness is an excellence of wanting that makes one disinclined to anger. Courage is an excellence of wanting that makes one resistant to the fear of death. Moderation is an excellence of needing that reduces one's desire for the enjoyment of worthless pleasures. Self-restraint is an excellence of needing that makes one hold back, through thinking, the craving impulse toward worthless pleasures. Justice is an excellence of the soul that distributes things according to worth. Liberality is an excellence of the soul that spends freely on what's beautiful. Greatness of soul is an excellence of soul that gives one the power to bear good fortune and bad fortune as well as honor and dishonor.</p>
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p>Foolishness is a failure of thinking that is responsible for bad living. Belligerence is a failing of wanting that makes one easily stirred to anger. Cowardice is a failure of wanting that strikes one with fear, especially of death. Decadence is a failure of needing that causes one to pursue worthless pleasures. Self-indulgence is a failure of needing that drags one through irrationality to the enjoyment of worthless pleasures. Injustice is a failure of the soul that makes one greedy beyond one's worth. Illiberality is a failure of the soul that causes one to grasp after gain from every source. Smallness of soul is a failure of the soul that makes one unable to bear good fortune and bad fortune as well as honor and dishonor.</p>
