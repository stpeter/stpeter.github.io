<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p>We praise what's beautiful and blame is what's worthless. The thrivings of character are the most prominent of the beautiful things; the failings of character are the most prominent of the worthless things. Also praised are what's responsible for the thrivings, what comes along with them, what brings them into being, and what results from them; also blamed are the opposites of these.</p>
<p>If, following Plato, we hold that the soul has three aspects, then wisdom is an thriving of thinking, mildness and courage are thrivings of wanting, moderation and self-restraint are thrivings of needing, and justice, liberality, and greatness of soul are thrivings of the soul overall. Foolishness is a failing of thinking, belligerence and cowardice are failings of wanting, decadence and self-indulgence are failings of needing, and injustice, illiberality, and smallness of soul are failings of the soul overall.</p>
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p>Wisdom is an thriving of thinking that procures what conduces to fulfillment. Mildness is an thriving of wanting that makes one disinclined to anger. Courage is an thriving of wanting that makes one resistant to the fear of death. Moderation is an thriving of needing that reduces one's desire for the enjoyment of worthless pleasures. Self-restraint is an thriving of needing that makes one hold back, through thinking, the craving impulse toward worthless pleasures. Justice is an thriving of the soul that distributes things according to worth. Liberality is an thriving of the soul that spends freely on what's beautiful. Greatness of soul is an thriving of soul that gives one the power to bear good fortune and bad fortune as well as honor and dishonor.</p>
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p>Foolishness is a failing of thinking that is responsible for bad living. Belligerence is a failing of wanting that makes one easily stirred to anger. Cowardice is a failing of wanting that strikes one with fear, especially of death. Decadence is a failing of needing that causes one to pursue worthless pleasures. Self-indulgence is a failing of needing that drags one through irrationality to the enjoyment of worthless pleasures. Injustice is a failing of the soul that makes one greedy beyond one's worth. Illiberality is a failing of the soul that causes one to grasp after gain from every source. Smallness of soul is a failing of the soul that makes one unable to bear good fortune and bad fortune as well as honor and dishonor.</p>
