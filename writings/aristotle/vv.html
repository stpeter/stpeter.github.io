<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p>The object of praise is what's beautiful; the object of blame is what's worthless. The excellences of character are the most prominent of the beautiful things; the failures of character are the most prominent of the worthless things. Also praised are what's responsible for the excellences, what comes along with them, what brings them into being, and what results from them; what's also blamed are the opposites of these.</p>
<p>If, following Plato, we hold that the soul has three aspects, then wisdom is the excellence of the thinking aspect, gentleness and courage are the excellences of the wanting aspect, moderation and self-restraint are the excellences of the needing aspect, and justice, generosity, and greatness of soul are the excellences of the soul overall. Foolishness is the failing of the thinking aspect, anger and cowardice are the failings of the wanting aspect, decadence and self-indulgence are the failings of the needing aspect, and injustice, stinginess, and smallness of soul are the failings of the soul overall.</p>
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p>Wisdom is an excellence of the thinking aspect and procures what conduces to fulfillment. Gentleness is an excellence of the wanting aspect, making one disinclined to anger. Courage is an excellence of the wanting aspect, making one resistant to the fear of death. Moderation is an excellence of the needing aspect, making one ungrasping for the enjoyment of worthless pleasures. Self-restraint is an excellence of the needing aspect, making one hold back through thinking the craving impulse toward worthless pleasures. Justice is an excellence of the soul that distributes things according to worth. Generosity is an excellence of the soul that spends freely on beautiful things. Greatness of soul is an excellence of soul giving one the power to bear good fortune and bad fortune as well as honor and dishonor.</p>
