<p><em>This is a provisional translation of On Virtues and Vices by Aristotle.</em></p>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p>The object of praise is what's beautiful; the object of blame is what's worthless. The excellences of character are the most prominent of the beautiful things; the failures of character are the most prominent of the worthless things. Also praised are what's responsible for the excellences, what comes along with them, what brings them into being, and what results from them; what's also blamed are the opposites of these.</p>
<p>If, following Plato, we hold that the soul has three aspects, then wisdom is the excellence of the aspect that has reason-and-speech, gentleness and courage the excellences of the aspect that has wants, moderation and self-restraint the excellences of the aspect that has needs, and justice, generosity, and greatness of soul the excellences of of the soul overall. Foolishness is the failing of the aspect that has reason-and-speech, anger and cowardice the failings of the aspect that has wants, decadence and self-indulgence the failings of the aspect that has needs, and injustice, stinginess, and smallness of soul the failings of the soul overall.</p>
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p>Wisdom is an excellence of the aspect that has reason-and-speech and procures what conduces to fulfillment. Gentleness is an excellence of the aspect that has wants, making one disinclined to anger. Courage is an excellence of the aspect that has wants, making one resistant to the fear of death. Moderation is an excellence of the aspect that has needs, making one ungrasping for the enjoyment of worthless pleasures. Self-restraint is an excellence of the aspect that has needs, making one hold back through thinking the craving impulse toward worthless pleasures. Justice is an excellence of the soul that distributes things according to worth. Generosity is an excellence of the soul that spends freely on beautiful things. Greatness of soul is an excellence of soul giving the power to bear good fortune and bad fortune as well as honor and dishonor.</p>
