<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p>We praise what's beautiful and blame what's worthless. The thrivings of character are the most prominent of the beautiful things; the failings of character are the most prominent of the worthless things. Also praised are what's responsible for the thrivings, what comes along with them, what brings them into being, and what results from them; also blamed are the opposites of these.</p>
<p>If, following Plato, we hold that personhood has three aspects, then wisdom is a thriving of thinking, mildness and courage are thrivings of wanting, moderation and self-restraint are thrivings of needing, and justice, liberality, and great-heartedness are thrivings of the person overall. Foolishness is a failing of thinking, belligerence and cowardice are failings of wanting, decadence and self-indulgence are failings of needing, and injustice, illiberality, and small-heartedness are failings of the person overall.</p>
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p>Wisdom is a thriving of thinking that procures what conduces to fulfillment. Mildness is a thriving of wanting that makes one disinclined to anger. Courage is a thriving of wanting that makes one resistant to the fear of death. Moderation is a thriving of needing that makes one ungrasping for the enjoyment of worthless pleasures. Self-restraint is a thriving of needing that makes one mindfully resist the craving impulse toward worthless pleasures. Justice is a thriving of personhood that distributes things according to worth. Liberality is a thriving of personhood that spends freely on what's beautiful. Great-heartedness is a thriving of personhood that gives one the power to handle good fortune and bad fortune as well as honor and dishonor.</p>
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p>Foolishness is a failing of thinking that is responsible for bad living. Belligerence is a failing of wanting that makes one easily stirred to anger. Cowardice is a failing of wanting that induces fear, especially the fear of death. Decadence is a failing of needing that causes one to pursue worthless pleasures. Self-indulgence is a failing of needing that drags one unthinkingly to the enjoyment of worthless pleasures. Injustice is a failing of personhood that makes one greedy for things beyond one's worth. Illiberality is a failing of personhood that causes one to grasp after gain from any and every source. Small-heartedness is a failing of personhood that makes one unable to handle good fortune and bad fortune as well as honor and dishonor.</p>
