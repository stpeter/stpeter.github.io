<p>(Note: This is a provisional translation of <cite>On Virtues and Vices</cite> by Aristotle; as to the likely authenticity of this work, see the following <a href='https://aristotelophile.com/Books/Articles/virtutibus.pdf'>paper</a> by Peter L.P. Simpson: "Aristotle's <cite>Ethica Eudemia</cite> 1220b10-11 ἐν τοῖς ἀπηλλαγµένοις and <cite>De Virtutibus et Vitiis</cite>", <cite>The Classical Quarterly</cite>, Volume 63, Issue 2, December 2013, pp. 651-659.)</p>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p>We praise what's beautiful and blame what's worthless. The thrivings of character are the most prominent of the beautiful things; the failings of character are the most prominent of the worthless things. Also praised are what's responsible for the thrivings, what comes along with them, what brings them into being, and what results from them; also blamed are the opposites of these.</p>
<p>If, following Plato, we hold that personhood has three aspects, then wisdom is a thriving of thinking, mildness and courage are thrivings of wanting, moderation and self-restraint are thrivings of needing, and justice, liberality, and great-heartedness are thrivings of the person overall. Foolishness is a failing of thinking, belligerence and cowardice are failings of wanting, decadence and self-indulgence are failings of needing, and injustice, illiberality, and small-heartedness are failings of the person overall.</p>
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p>Wisdom is a thriving of thinking that procures what conduces to fulfillment. Mildness is a thriving of wanting that makes one disinclined to anger. Courage is a thriving of wanting that makes one resistant to the fear of death. Moderation is a thriving of needing that makes one ungrasping for the enjoyment of worthless pleasures. Self-restraint is a thriving of needing that makes one mindfully resist the impulsive craving for worthless pleasures. Justice is a thriving of personhood that distributes things according to worth. Liberality is a thriving of personhood that spends freely on what's beautiful. Great-heartedness is a thriving of personhood that gives one the power to handle good fortune and bad fortune as well as honor and dishonor.</p>
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p>Foolishness is a failing of thinking that is responsible for bad living. Belligerence is a failing of wanting that makes one easily stirred to anger. Cowardice is a failing of wanting that induces fear, especially the fear of death. Decadence is a failing of needing that causes one to pursue worthless pleasures. Self-indulgence is a failing of needing that drags one unthinkingly to the enjoyment of worthless pleasures. Injustice is a failing of personhood that makes one greedy for things beyond one's worth. Illiberality is a failing of personhood that causes one to grasp after gain from any and every source. Small-heartedness is a failing of personhood that makes one unable to handle good fortune and bad fortune as well as honor and dishonor.</p>
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p>To wisdom belong deliberation, discernment of what is good and bad as well as everything in life that is to be preferred and avoided, beautiful use of all good things, keeping good company, taking advantage of the opportune moment, the astute use of words and deeds, and experience regarding everything useful. Memory, experience, and astuteness all arise from wisdom or accompany it. Alternatively some of these might be contributing causes of wisdom, such as memory and experience, while others are aspects of wisdom, such as astuteness and successful deliberation.</p>
<p>To mildness belong the ability to moderately handle assault and contempt, to not rush quickly to retaliation, to not be easily spurred to anger, to not be bitter or contentious in one's character, to maintain one's equilibrium and steadfastness.</p>
<p>To courage belong not being overtaken by fears of death, being bold in fearful situations, being brave in the face of danger, preferring to dying beautifully over saving oneself in an ugly way, and shouldering responsibility for victory. It also belongs to courage to work hard, to demonstrate endurance, and to take things like a man. Qualities that come along with courage are bravery, high spirits, confidence, audacity, a love of toil, and endurance.</p>
<p>To moderation belong not being fascinated by the enjoyment of bodily pleasures, not grasping after the enjoyment of ugly pleasures, apprehension over justly deserved security, and a well-ordered way of life in matters large and small. Qualities that come along with moderation are self-discipline, decorum, a sense of shame, and thoughtfulness.</p>
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p>To self-restraint belongs the ability to mindfully resist the impulsive craving for worthless pleasures, as well as endurance and steadfastness in the face of poverty and pain.</p>
<p>To justice belong distributing things according to worth, preserving the customs and laws (written and unwritten) of one's country, being truthful in matters of significance, and honoring one's agreements. Doing justice to the high gods comes first, followed by the less deities, one's country, one's parents, and one's ancestors. Piety is either part of justice or comes along with it. Purity, truthfulness, faith, and hatred of evil also follow from justice.</p>
<p>To liberality belong giving lavishly with regard to what's praiseworthy, spending in abundance on necessities, being helpful when disagreements arise, and not accepting things from those one shouldn't. Liberal people are also elegant in their clothing and household, surround themselves with superfluous, beautiful, delightful things that bring pleasure without attention to making a profit, and like to keep animals that distinctive and wonderful. Qualities that follow from liberality are having an adaptable and easy-going character, being kind and compassionate, and loving friends, strangers, and what's beautiful.</p>
<p>To great-heartedness belong handling good fortune and bad fortune as well as honor and dishonor; being unimpressed by luxury, flattery, power, or winning in contested matters; and having a certain depth and grandeur in one's person. Great-hearted people don't make too much of life and aren't overly fond of living; in their character they are straightforward and noble; and when wronged they are able to refrain from being punitive. A dedication to truth and a lack of pretense also follow from great-heartedness.</p>
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p>To foolishness belong being a bad judge of things, deliberating badly, keeping bad company, using badly the goods at hand, and having false opinions about what's good and beautiful in life. Qualities that come along with foolishness are inexperience, ignorance, self-indulgence, awkwardness, and a poor memory.</p>
<p>There are three forms of belligerence: being hot-tempered, bitter, or sullen. Belligerent people can't handle minor insults and attacks; they are vengeful, punitive, and easily angered by any chance word or deed. Qualities that follow on belligerence are irritability, a changeable character, bitter language, being pained by small things - and experiencing all these things quickly and on trifling occasions.</p>
<p>To cowardice belong being easily moved to chance fears, especially of death and bodily injury, and assuming that every manner of self-preservation is better than coming to a beautiful end. Qualities that follow on cowardice are weakness, unmanliness, laziness, and overfondness for life. Underlying it all is a kind of cautious and timid personality.</p>
<p>To decadence belong pursuing the enjoyment of harmful, ugly pleasures; assuming that people who subsit in such pleasures are especially fulfilled; to be fond of laughing, jeering, and joking; and to be reckless in word and deed. Qualities that follow on decadence are disorder, shamelessness, lack of discipline, a taste for luxury and loose living, carelessness, contemptuousness, and an overly relaxed approach to life.</p>
<p>To self-indulgence belong choosing the enjoyment of pleasures that reason forbids, partaking of them even though believing that it is better not to, and while thinking that one ought to do what is beautiful and beneficial desisting from doing so for the sake of pleasure. Qualities that follow on self-indulgence are weakness, being full of regrets, and in general the qualities that follow on decadence.</p>
