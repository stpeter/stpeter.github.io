Pyrrhiad, Book I

Sing me, muse, of two men who lived as gods.
So many were the lands through which they passed,
So many were the minds from which they learned,
While, by the one man seeking to rule all
And by the other reaching out to know,
They travelled far from Greece to India.
First Alexander, King of Makedon, 
Whose fame will last as long as men shall live:
Just as a huge wave crashes on the shore
And smashes all before it when the earth
Afar is shaken by Poseidon’s rage,
So Alexander broke upon the East,
Forever changing all within his wake.
Then second, sing me, too, of one who lived
Unknown, yet rivalled Zeus for happiness:
Although he conquered nothing in his path,
His path led him to conquering within,
To mastery of no one but himself; 
For wisdom brought him deep serenity.
From Elis, the Epeians’ land, he came; 
Son of Pleistarchos, Pyrrho was his name.

O muse, come be my ally, for I doubt
The texture of the tale I dare to tell:
Its warp and woof are lost within the past,
Beyond recovery, uncertain, dim;
At this late date the details cannot be
Defined with clarity; so, uninclined
To this interpretation or to that,
I flow within the stream of what has been
And joy to tell the story of a world
That had such giants in it, long ago.
Dread goddess, Zeus’ daughter, let us start
When Pyrrho first in youth took mind to heart.

Before then art had been his sole pursuit:
His skill lay in the work of paints and forms
To please and fool the eye with semblances 
Of what is real. His hero in the art,
Zeuxis of Heraclea, once portrayed
Some grapes so true to life that hungry birds
Flew down to forage in his studio.
Though Pyrrho, too, had yearned to walk that road,
The love of wisdom proved a stronger goad.

Democritus of Abdera it was
Who fired within his soul the drive to know.
Far north in Thrace lay wealthy Abdera,
Upon the main across from Thassos fair.
The town grew rich with trade along the coast,
With Makedon to westward, with Persia,
With the islands, with kingdoms to the north.
Gold, timber, kine, and olive oil passed
Through its twin harbors, off to far-flung lands.
The family of Democritus found wealth
There, too, along with fellow Adberites.
The town gave lavish host to Darius
When he invaded Greece, and then when he
Returned to Persia after he had lost:
It shamed them twice and double did it cost.

To such great wealth Democritus was heir.
He could have spent it all on pomps and shows,
On pleasures, and on influence with kings.
Instead he traveled far and wide to learn
All that he could: with priests of Egypt he
Conferred, astronomers in Babylon,
Wise magi at the Persian court, and great
Philosophers throughout the Grecian lands.
Know well that most of these stayed put at home,
To hone whatever wisdom they knew best;
Democritus, by contrast, came to them
Alone to research, study, and converse, 
To gain whatever knowledge he could glean
About the things we see and things unseen.

Inspired by Democritus - his book,
His thoughts, his journeys, and what they might mean -
Young Pyrrho went to see the one he knew
In Elis to be wise, the only friend
Of Socrates still looking on the sun:
Phaedo - who fifty years before was there
When Socrates was made to drain the cup
Of hemlock and to thereby end his life
Of questioning and self-examination.
When all the friends of Socrates then fled
From Athens, Phaedo came back home again
To know the good and form the best of men.

So Pyrrho ventured forth to Phaedo’s house
And searchingly he spoke in winged words:
“O best of men and wisest of Eleans,
I come to share in thought and seek advice.
Pleistarchos I can claim as my dear father,
A man well known to all who live in Elis,
Whose line for generations stretches back
To when Epeius, shepherd of the people,
Led forth the men of Elis to the shores
Of windy Ilion, when all of Greece
Adventured north to bring back Helen and
To sack the sacred citadel of Troy,
And thence to gather everlasting fame.
Thus far our line; and Pyrrho is my name.”

Then Phaedo too replied with thought and care:
“O Pyrrho son of Pleistarchos, well met.
You speak with insight far beyond your years,
And yet you say you come in wisdom’s need.
Many are those from whom I too have learned
Among the friends of Socrates and from
The man himself, who turned me to the path
Of wisdom when I was about your age.
So long philosophy has been my task;
And I will try to answer what you ask.”

“O Phaedo,” said the younger man, “although
Your words do honor me far in excess
Of any worth I have, they swell the heart
Within my breast that reaches out to know.
The city fathers have entrusted me
To paint a mural on the walls of our 
Gymnasium; it happens that last week
I overheard some students there recite
Out from a book Democritus once wrote
And then converse about what they had heard.
I marvel at the things that I heard, too,
And wonder if indeed they can be true.”

Then Phaedo said: “My mentor, Socrates,
Would often say that wonder is the start
On any road that leads to wisdom’s love,
And so your journey seems quite well begun.
Now, as to understanding what is true,
I can attest that it’s a lifelong quest.
Indeed Democritus himself once said
That neither skill nor wisdom can be had
Unless you learn. And yet the learning is
But half the race, for what you come to know
Must be applied in action and in thought,
Else you will never gain what you have sought.”

Yet Pyrrho, all aflame for learning truth, 
Pressed forward in his zeal and spoke again
In winged words: “O Phaedo, well I know 
That of Eleans you are thought most wise.
Instruction in the truth is what I seek,
A teacher who can give me answers, clear
My doubts, and wash away all youthful fear.”

Then gently redirecting Pyrrho’s zeal,
Old Phaedo spoke again with thought and care:
“I wish it were as easy as you think:
Not even Socrates could teach such truth!
Young Pyrrho, you may be aware that there
Are certain tiny animals that, though
They sting us, leave no mark upon the skin;
It’s only in the swelling of the flesh
That we can know their bite, so subtle and
Deceptive is their power. Just so is our
Experience when dealing with the wise:
You will not learn precisely when or how
The benefit from being with them came,
But slowly you will know it in the end.
You do not need a teacher, but a friend.”

Then, thoughtful, Pyrrho gave a calm reply:
“O Phaedo, you have given much upon
Which to reflect - for this you have my thanks.
For now I think that I must ponder well
Upon the generous words that you have shared.
I see things aren’t as simple as they seem,
And that the path to wisdom might be long.
I hope that when I’m ready we may speak
To guide me toward the insight that I seek.”

So Pyrrho spoke, and Phaedo gave reply:
“Well met I say again, young friend, well met.
Whenever you may think that it is best,
You will be welcome to return my guest.”
