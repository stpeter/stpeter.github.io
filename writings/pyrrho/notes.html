<h1>Notes Toward Gods Among Men</h1>
<p>Last Updated: 2024-08-14</p>
<p>(See also passages from <a href='democritus.html'>Democritus</a>, with others to follow.)</p>
<ul>
<li>"According to early tradition, the awakening left the Buddha in a stunned silence." (Batchelor, Secular Buddhism, p. 221.) This is exactly what was claimed of Pyrrho - ἀφασία.</li>
<li>"In some places, the Macedonians worshipped Zeus in combination with the supreme god of Egypt, Amon. The oracle of Zeus at Dodona, in the mountains of Epirus west of Greece, instructed them to. All things Egyptian were prestigious, and so the Macedonians obeyed the oracle and worshipped Zeus and Amon together. Later, when Alexander came to the throne, this local idiosyncrasy would provide him an introduction to Egyptian religion." From <cite>Soldier, Priest, and God: A Life of Alexander the Great</cite> by F.S. Naiden.</li>
<li>Xenocrates went with Aristotle to Atarneus at or before the death of Plato in 348 (even though he was opposed to Macedonian influence) and in 340 was called by Speusippus to return so as to become scholiarch of the Academy; yet there was an election anyway in 339/338. Note also that Xenocrates was three times a member of Athenian legations to Macedonian leaders, once to Philip and twice to Antipater.</li>
<li>Being adoxastos is similar to the cultivation of naive perception in painting. (cf. Bergson on pure perception.)</li>
<li>I need to look into the positions of all the schools on doxa; specifically, the interactions among hupolepsis (consideration), epamphotizerein (going both ways, accepting ambiguity), psellizein (hesitation), adoxastos (lacking opinions), aklines (being uninclined), and epoche (suspension of judgment).</li>
<li>There is a good quote from Lieh Tzu on conquering oneself.</li>
</ul>
