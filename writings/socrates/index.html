<h1>No One Wiser</h1>
<h2>An Intellectual Biography of Socrates</h2>
<h2>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h2>
<p>After I finish writing books about <a href='/writings/aristotle/'>Aristotle</a> and <a href='/writings/pyrrho/'>Pyrrho</a>, I'd like to create a brief biography of Socrates.</p>
<p>At the moment I am thinking that the book will examine Socrates' life and thought through a consideration of Plato's Socratic dialogues in <a href='https://monadnock.net/plato/order.html'>dramatic order</a>, as well as modern reflections on his relevance to a life well lived. I might even compose the whole thing as a dialogue (perhaps between Plato and Aristotle!), but I have yet to settle on the format.</p>
<p>As always with projects of this sort, I'm keeping <a href='notes.html'>notes</a> and maintaining a <a href='readings.html'>reading list</a>.</p>
