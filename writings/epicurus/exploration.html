<h1>Letters on Happiness</h1>
<h2>Suggestions for Further Exploration</h2>

<p>If you enjoyed <a href='happiness.html'>Letters on Happiness</a>, here are some other works you might like.</p>

<p>First, the Roman poet Lucretius wrote a long poem on Epicurean philosophy entitled <cite>The Nature of Things</cite>, which A.E. Stallings has beautifully translated into English (hers is the version I quote from in the dialogue). Another ancient poet influenced by Epicurus was Horace, whose most Epicurean-minded poems I have translated in my collection <cite>Ancient Fire</cite> (2000). Other poets of an Epicurean bent include Catullus, Tennyson, Swinburne, and Pessoa.</p>

<p>Both <cite>The Epicurus Reader</cite> and <cite>The Essential Epicurus</cite> provide English versions of the few writings of Epicurus that survive from antiquity. My own translations of his fragmentary texts on the good life can be found at <a href='http://www.monadnock.net/epicurus/'>http://www.monadnock.net/epicurus/</a>.</p>

<p><cite>Letters on Happiness</cite> is the fifth volume in a six-movement suite of books I'm writing on the art of living:</p>
