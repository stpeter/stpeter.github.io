<h1>Václav Havel on the Power of the Powerless</h1>
<h2>by Peter Saint-Andre</h2>
<p>(March 2021.)</p>
<p>In 1978, Czech playwright Václav Havel illegally published <cite>The Power of the Powerless</cite>, a set of deep reflections on life under communism. As a result, he was imprisoned for four years and thereafter continually harassed by the secret police until the fall of the Iron Curtain and his unlikely elevation as President of Czechoslovakia in 1990. Although it might seem that Havel's insights would be dated by now, it turns out that they are perhaps more timely than ever.</p>
<p>Havel begins with a homely example: the local manager of the state-owned fruit and vegetable shop places in the window a sign that reads "Workers of the World, Unite!" Why does he do so? Is he truly enthusiastic about unification of the workers of the world, or does he wish to signal his compliance and obedience, and thus to be left in peace and relieved of fear?</p>
<p>Naturally the grocer does not wish to admit to himself that fear drives him to be unquestioningly obedient toward those in power. And those in power know this, which is why they had to invent a high-sounding justification for obedience: ideology.</p>
<p>Havel draws a distinction between the pure, classical dictatorship of raw power and what he calls the post-totalitarian system. In a dictatorship such as the one-man rule of Idi Amin in Uganda or François Duvalier in Haiti, despotic power is exercised openly and almost honestly. By contrast, in the post-totalitarian system, ideology provides the illusion of morality, integrity, and personal dignity while making those qualities unattainable.</p>
<p>Yet ideology has an undeniable appeal because it is "almost a secularized religion":</p>
<blockquote>
  To wandering mankind it offers an immediately available home: all one has to do is accept it, and suddenly everything becomes clear once more, life takes on new meaning, and all mysteries, unanswered questions, anxiety, and loneliness vanish. Of course, one pays dearly for this low-rent home: the price is abdication of one's own reason, conscience, and responsibility...
</blockquote>
<p>This abdication results in the drab, lifeless automatism of post-totalitarian society. It is a society "thoroughly permeated with hypocrisy and lies" in which all human reality is falsified; "individuals need not believe all these mystifications, but they must behave as though they did." It is a society in which people are literally de-moralized and "surrender their human identity in favour of the identity of the system"; "everyone in his or her own way is both a victim and a supporter of the system." It is a society in which "the centre of power is identical with the centre of truth," enforced by "intricate and well-developed mechanisms for the direct and indirect manipulation of the entire population" and "a complex mechanism of direct and indirect surveillance that has no equal in history."</p>
<p>Thankfully, these horrors of communism are a thing of the past and have no relevance to the liberal, progressive society we're blessed to live in, right? Not so fast. Havel reserved perhaps his harshest criticism not for the Eastern Bloc but for the countries of the West, where "people are manipulated in ways that are infinitely more subtle and refined than the brutal methods used in the post-totalitarian societies." And he made these observations in 1978! What would he think of the even more subtle and refined methods of manipulation available today, in the form of social media, opaque algorithms, gamification, and apps and systems of every kind to which humans must conform? Would he not see even more clearly than we do that truth is now determined by trillion-dollar companies and what he called "the dictatorship of technology"? When even a sitting president of the United States can be deplatformed, it is obvious where the true power lies.</p>
<p>Applying Havel's insights into the differences between dictatorship and the post-totalitarian system, we can see that Donald Trump was a disruptive demagogue, but in the end ephemeral because he ruled merely through force of personality. By contrast, the totalizing ideology of Wokism presents a more radical threat to human freedom, for it is cultivating a growing climate of fear. Today's coffee-shop manager places a "Black Lives Matter" sign in the window for reasons not so different from Havel's grocer: to signal compliance and obedience. American society is rapidly becoming what Havel might call a post-liberal system.</p>
<p>What is the antidote to the automatism of the post-totalitarian or post-liberal system? Havel observed that these systems force individuals to "live within a lie" by submerging their identity in the identity of the system. For Havel, the solution is not partisan opposition or the development of an alternative ideology, but "living in truth" by honoring the "pre-political" level of human interaction and cooperation. This does not necessarily require active dissent but deeply human activities, whether in one's workplace, school, or community. In the Soviet bloc these activities took the form of underground publishing houses, universities, places of worship, and trade unions. Although matters have not yet come to that point in the West, one wonders if and when such parallel structures will become necessary.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Havel was what we might call a personalist, who valued the human person above all systems of power, whether political or technological. In this he had much in common with Karol Wojtyła (better known as Pope John Paul II) and with Martin Luther King, Jr. All three of these thinkers and doers were deeply influenced by personalist philosophers such as Jan Patočka in Czechoslovakia (a co-signer with Havel of Charter 77), Max Scheler in Germany (on whom Wojtyła wrote his dissertation), and Edgar Brightman in the United States (with whom King studied at Boston University). King's personalism, for example, led him to dream of the day when his children would "live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character" &mdash; a humanistic principle that is very much at odds with today's Woke ideology.</p>
<p>The national motto of the Czech Republic is "Pravda Vítězí": truth prevails. First as a dissident and then as the initial post-communist president of Czechoslovakia and then of the Czech Republic, Havel was committed to living in truth and to prevailing over lies and hatred. His example can serve as an inspiration in the depersonalized atmosphere of our increasingly post-liberal society.</p>
