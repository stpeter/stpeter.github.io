<p>Roger E. Bissell and Vinay Kolhatkar are nothing if not ambitious. With <em>Modernizing Aristotle's Ethics: Toward a New Art and Science of Self-Actualization</em> [1] they have set out to establish not only "a universalizable ethic that promotes the best within us" but also "a universalizable politics for a free society that can make everyone's personal best easier to achieve." [2] They propose to accomplish this goal by "bringing about a merger between science and philosophy and crafting a fact-based teleologic ethic" undergirded by "a testable model for why it works &mdash; a comprehensive theory of human nature." [3]</p>

<p>This is a tall order indeed. Although the authors do not claim to have provided the final word, at the same time they seem fairly confident that their "new integration" [4] is on the right track. Because they cover so many topics, a brief review cannot hope to do justice to the full range of their insights. Here I will focus primarily on two areas of interest: first, some core issues in Aristotelian ethics and the propriety of building, or at least adding onto, an "Aristotelian skyscraper" [5] fit for life in the modern world; and second their contributions to a post-Objectivist ethics that is both more humane and more liveable.</p>

<h3>Aristotelian Foundations</h3>

<p>The authors state up front that their "goal is not merely to <em>modernize</em> Aristotle's ethics, but to reformulate Aristotle's <em>eudaimonism</em> and transform it into an ethics of self-actualization that is relevant and powerful for people living today." [6] Although it's true that Aristotle provided a deep and comprehensive analysis of eudaimonia, this does not necessarily mean that he advocated what today we think of as eudaimonism. Because the risk of anachronism looms large here, it's important to proceed with scrupulous care.</p>

<p>In contemporary philosophy, the primary source for an ethics of eudaimonism is David Norton's book <em>Personal Destinies</em>. [7] For several reasons, it behooves us to take a closer look at Norton's account in the context of Bissell and Kolhatkar's project. First, Norton treated eudaimonism and self-actualization as equivalent. [8] Second, psychological theorists of self-actualization and personal expressiveness (also treated in the psychological literature as equivalent), including Alan Waterman, Carol Ryff, Richard Ryan, and Edward Deci, have considered Norton's book to be the canonical account not only of philosophical eudaimonism but of eudaimonia itself, and thus by extension Aristotle's conception of human flourishing. Third, Bissell and Kolhatkar frequently cite Norton for support, such as when they state that if "living well becomes second nature ... [y]ou have actualized the fully adult, humane, productive self that was potentially there as you were learning and growing as a child and as a young person. A developmental psychology leading to eudaimonia is thus clearly a psychology of self-actualization." [9]</p>

<p>Given that Aristotle is the ultimate source for our concepts of potentiality and actualization, we might assume that the notion of a "self that was potentially there" is straightforward Aristotelianism. But not so fast. On closer inspection, one sees that Norton derived his eudaimonism from Sartre's existentialism, Nietzsche's will to power, Kirekegaard's Christian theology, Leibniz's monadology, a bizarre interpretation of Plato's metaphysics in which each individual's daimon is a Platonic Form, and an unjustifiably universalized reading of Socrates's intellectual midwifery in which every person possesses the same kind of daimon and personal truth that Socrates attained only through decades of philosophical labor. Conspicuously missing from this list is Aristotle; indeed, after praising "those respects in which Plato's metaphysics justified Greek moral individualism," Norton laments that "it is these very respects that are immediately undermined by the metaphysics of Aristotle." [10]</p>

<p>What's going on here? Could it be that contemporary eudaimonism isn't quite as Aristotelian as everyone has been assuming?</p>

<p>Aristotle defined eudaimonia as living well. [11] Building on that foundation, Bissell and Kolhatkar make the bold statement that "in common sense terms, there is not much of a conceptual gap between living well or human flourishing (eudaimonia) and self-actualization." [12] Yet the nature of this gap is precisely the issue, and one of paramount importance. For Aristotle, the self is an achievement; [13] for recent theorists of eudaimonism and self-actualization, the self somehow exists "in potentia" from birth or perhaps even before, if Norton's quasi-Platonic metaphysics is to be believed. Following in the footsteps of Socrates and Plato, Aristotle seems to have held more specifically that the self is an achievement only of those who pursue a philosophical way of life, who commit to deeply understanding the human good, who put in the hard work of living an examined life (on all this, see Pierre Hadot's groundbreaking work on philosophy as a way of life, especially his book <em>What Is Ancient Philosophy?</em> [14]).</p>

<p>Where does this leave Bissell and Kolhatkar's Aristotelian skyscraper? At the least, further work is needed to understand whether its foundations are quite as Aristotelian as they think. Yet we can go further and wonder if a time-travelling Aristotle would really go about building a skyscraper in the first place.</p>

<p>There are tensions at the heart of any project that aims to modernize Aristotle. The three senses that are most relevant here are as follows: Aristotle and the ancients considered understanding things to be an end in itself, whereas we moderns value knowledge primarily as an instrument of power; they saw the maxim "know thyself" as leading ideally to self-mastery, whereas we care primarily about personal expressiveness; they prized the activities of leisure (festivals, music, dramatic performances, great conversation, intellectual inquiry, philosophical speculation, and the like), whereas we are driven primarily by productive work and material progress. [15] Indeed, we could even say that on these matters modernity has rejected Aristotle, so perhaps an Aristotelian would be justified in rejecting these aspects of modernity in favor of a more contemplative life. (Naturally, what that might look like is far beyond the scope of this review.)</p>

<p>These tensions come to a head in Bissell and Kolhatkar's continued use of Ayn Rand as the modern exponent par excellence of Aristotelian philosophy. It seems to me that, at least on the foregoing three issues (and likely more &mdash; for instance Rand's criticism that Aristotle did not consider ethics to be a science), reports of Rand's Aristotelianism have been greatly exaggerated.</p>

<h3>Objectivist Integrations</h3>

<p>With all that having been said, Bissell and Kolhatkar also explore, within a neo-Objectivist or post-Objectivist framework, [16] a great number of fascinating topics at the borderline between psychology and philosophy. Indeed, "Buttressing Ayn Rand's Ethics" might have been a more appropriate title for their book, because they engage much more directly with Rand than with Aristotle (except, interestingly, in their chapter on politics). It's here that they come into their own and make a number of truly original contributions, both theoretical and practical. No doubt their valuable integrations with recent scientific research will be debated for years, and deserve to be folded into the kind of broad-minded Objectivism that is, to use one of their preferred adjectives, more humane than ever before.</p>

<p>In their third chapter, the authors provide a comprehensive discussion of twelve psychological needs that human beings "must satisfy ... if they are to achieve a psychic state that's serene in equilibrium, and excited by choice or chance." [17] A number of these needs go back to Marie Jahoda's 1958 integration [18] of prior work by social, psychodynamic, and humanistic psychologists like Gordon Allport, Erik Erikson, Erich Fromm, Heinz Hartmann, Abraham Maslow, and Carl Rogers. In Jahoda's phrasing, the six fundamentals needs are autonomy, accurate perception of reality, attitudes toward the self, personal growth and self-actualization, psychological integration, and environmental mastery (a broad category that includes competence in both practical affairs and human relationships, with the latter often separated out into a distinct component by subsequent psychological theorists). To these six, our authors add a belief in one's own goodness (perhaps part of "attitudes toward the self"), discovering or creating a "true self" (perhaps part of personal growth and self-actualization), recognition and reward for one's achievements, inspirational experience, and for some people creating a genetic or non-genetic legacy (similar to what Erik Erikson called "generativity").</p>

<p>The authors re-use Maslow's definition of a need as "something whose absence demonstrably worsens the organism's mental and/or physical health, and whose presence in optimal quantities becomes necessary (but not *by itself* sufficient) to reach a flourishing state." [19] However, it is unclear to what extent the twelve psychological needs are meant to align with the psychological literature. For example, in their two-page overview of autonomy [20] they do not reference definitions of this construct proposed by theorists from Karl Jung and Heinz Hartmann in the 1930s through Carol Ryff, Richard Ryan, and Edward Deci in the 1990s and beyond.</p>

<p>Moreover, are all of these things really needs, and does something have to be a need in order for it to matter or be valued in life? Consider that Aristotle's psychological theory describes not one but three kinds of reaching out into the world: needs, wants, and (among humans) deliberate resolutions to act. Aristotle also explored aspirations such as wonder (the starting point of philosophy), yearning to understand the world (the foundation for learning and science), and love for what is beautifully right (the aim of character development). For Aristotle, these are not needs but higher ideals open only to people who have been properly enculturated. Does modern psychology add something over and above Aristotle's insights by labelling everything valuable a need? The authors do not offer the kind of philosophical analysis that would make this clear.</p>

<p>In addition to the twelve psychological needs, the authors posit seven key faculties &mdash; or "abilities, natural or acquired, for a particular kind of action" [21] &mdash; of the human person: rationality, introspection, tenacity, the capacity for joy, goodwill and empathy, wisdom, and resilience. Here again it is unclear whether these faculties are intended to align with the scientific literature or with Aristotle's analysis of various human capacities. As an example of the latter, Aristotle considered practical wisdom (<em>phronesis</em>) to be a capstone virtue, for he argued that "it is not possible to be fully good without practical wisdom nor practically wise without virtue of character." [22] Aristotle describes various component skills of practical wisdom such as comprehension, sensitivity, insight, and know-how, which come together to form a stable trait or intellectual virtue that helps a person understand how to size up a given situation and to act appropriately given the circumstances. Yet nothing of this is reflected in the authors' single paragraph about wisdom. [23]</p>

<p>Because Aristotle conceived of virtue as the activation of a capacity, it is surprising that Bissell and Kolhatkar do not mention Chris Peterson and Martin Seligman's massive volume <em>Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification</em>. [24] This tome, which required contributions from over 50 scholars, was intended to function as a "manual of the sanities" and an equivalent of the standard Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) but for positive psychology. Although the untimely death of Peterson in 2012 seems to have slowed further work in this area, one noteworthy theorist here is Blaine Fowers, who uses virtue ethics as the basis for his work at the intersection of psychology and the virtues (see his especially his book <em>Virtue and Psychology</em> [25]).</p>

<p>It might seem that my comments to this point are overly critical. However, I have mentioned these gaps and omissions because they provide intriguing opportunities for the authors and likeminded others to further knit together what their subtitle calls the art and science of self-actualization. There is plenty of work to be done.</p>

<p>Moreover, as the authors emphasize, that work is not only theoretical but practical. Sprinkled liberally throughout <em>Modernizing Aristotle's Ethics</em> are numerous actionable suggestions for formulating a personal mission in life, building healthy relationships, strengthening one's character, finding greater joy, resolving value conflicts, and integrating the many domains of one's existence into a seamless whole. They have truly lived up to the promise that Rand first made of creating a philosophy for living on earth.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I suspect that not enough people, whether scholars or intellectually curious members of the general public, will benefit from their work, for <em>Modernizing Aristotle's Ethics</em> is available only in hardcover at a price of over $100. This will greatly limit its audience, to the detriment of authors and readers alike. Perhaps a paperback edition will be forthcoming; in any case, we can hope their insights will have a long-term impact through continued engagement and application in both the theoretical and practical realms.</p>

Athough Bissell and Kolhatkar mention that their goal was not to produce a complete exposition of Aristotle's ethics or broader philosophy, one might wish that they had more carefully represented some of his positions and contributions. Their erroneous or questionable claims include: that dialectics was "Aristotle's signature philosophical method" (p. 15), that the goal of the <em>Historia Animalium</em> was to build a "biological taxonomy" (p. 18), that animals can be <em>eudaimon</em> (p. 22), that the "highest good for living beings [including even human beings] is ... to get and have what one needs" (p. 22), that under Aristotle's doctrine of the mean the virtue of courage is "a middle ground or 'mean' between rashness (too much courage) and cowardice (too little courage)" (p. 39), that Aristotle identified "four primary ethical virtues: courage, temperance, justice, and prudence" (p. 43) when in fact he did not subscribe to a theory of cardinal virtues and he thought that prudence (one rendering of <em>phronesis</em>) is an intellectual virtue, that "Aristotle postulated eudaimonia as an 'ought'" (p. 183) in the modern meaning of the term, and that Aristotle considered happiness in the sense of subjective well-being as the goal of ethics (pp. 183, 213).</p>

<p>[15] With regard to material wealth, Bissell and Kolhatkar quote Ayn Rand's disciple Leonard Peikoff as saying that 'there is no limit to man's need of wealth .... every material achievement contributes to human life by making it increasingly secure, prolonged, and/or pleasurable' (<em>Modernizing Aristotle's Ethics</em>, p. 121). This is a decidedly un-Aristotelian perspective, for in Politics I.9 Aristotle explains that those who seek wealth without limit do so because they have set no limit to their desires &mdash; a corrupted state caused by caring about merely living, not living well (i.e., eudaimonia).</p>
