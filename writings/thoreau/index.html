<h1>The Upland Farm</h1>
<h2>Thoreau on Cultivating a Better Life</h2>
<h2>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h2>
<p><a href='https://www.amazon.com/dp/0999186310/'><img src="/images/upland-small.jpg" width="225" height="360" border="0" alt="The Upland Farm" align="left"/></a>Henry David Thoreau, both naturalist and transcendentalist, always perceived the possibility of living a better life &mdash; some employment on your higher ground, which he called your upland farm. His writings encourage you to live deliberately, to pursue a path you can walk with love and reverence, to advance confidently in the direction of your dreams.</p>
<p>Although Thoreau is often thought of as a mountain man or noble savage, in fact he favored a blending of civilization and wildness &mdash; and he still has much to teach us about the balance between work and leisure, society and solitude, nature and humanity, reflection and action, theory and practice.</p>
<p> <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Seasons-Thoreau-Reflections-Life-Nature/dp/0999186302/'><img src="/images/seasons-small.jpg" width="225" height="360" border="0" alt="Seasons of Thoreau" align="left"/></a>In <cite>Walden</cite>, Thoreau said that to be a philosopher is so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates. <cite>The Upland Farm</cite> explores Thoreau's timeless views on ethics and happiness for modern readers in an inspiring yet practical way.</p>
<p>The book will always be available for free <a href='upland-farm.html'>on this website</a>, along with a companion volume of selections entitled <a href='seasons.html'>Seasons of Thoreau</a>. Kindle and paperback versions of both <a href='https://www.amazon.com/dp/0999186310/'>The Upland Farm</a> and <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Seasons-Thoreau-Reflections-Life-Nature/dp/0999186302/'>Seasons of Thoreau</a> are available at Amazon. Paperbacks can also be purchased in person at <a href='http://www.thoreausociety.org/about/shop-walden'>Walden Pond</a>. I've provided some <a href='exploration.html'>suggestions for further exploration</a>, too, and I'm working on a <a href='syllabus.html'>syllabus</a> for a yearlong seminar on Thoreau. Feel free to <a href='/contact.html'>contact me</a> if you have comments or would like to start a conversation.</p>
