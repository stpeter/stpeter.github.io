<h1>Peter Saint-Andre: Writings</h1>
<p>My main project as a writer so far is a suite of reflections on six philosophers who value reason, individuality, and freedom. To increase the challenge of writing for me and the ease and variety of reading for you, each book is less than 80 pages long and is presented in a different literary form:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href='/writings/roark/'>The Tao of Roark: Variations on a Theme from Ayn Rand</a> (2012)</li>
  <li><a href='/writings/nietzsche/'>Songs of Zarathustra: Poetic Perspectives on Nietzsche's Philosophy of Life</a> (2018)</li>
  <li><a href='/writings/thoreau/'>The Upland Farm: Thoreau on Cultivating a Better Life</a> (2017)</li>
  <li><a href='/writings/epicurus/'>Letters on Happiness: An Epicurean Dialogue</a> (2013)</li>
  <li><a href='/writings/pyrrho/'>Gods Among Men: The Story of Pyrrho and Alexander the Great</a> (research underway)</li>
  <li><a href='/writings/aristotle/'>Complete Thyself: Aristotle on Human Fulfillment</a> (in progress)</li>
</ol>
<p>After that, I plan to write a capstone book entitled <a href='/writings/being/'>Being Human</a> that will integrate the lessons of psychological evidence and philosophical practice on the great task of living an excellent human life.</p>
<p>I also have in mind to write an <a href='/writings/socrates/'>intellectual biography</a> of Socrates, an exploration of <a href='/journal/1864.html'>philosophical issues in Shakespeare</a>, a set of <a href='/writings/slowtime/'>linked short stories</a> about life in the 22nd century, and a book on the <a href='/writings/music/'>philosophy of music</a>. But I might not have time for all of that!</p>
<p>In addition, I've written or am working on the following books:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href='http://monadnock.net/epicurus/'>Epicurus on the Good Life: A Fresh Translation</a> (in progress)</li>
<li><a href='/writings/rand/'>Randian Reflections</a> (2009)</li>
<li><a href='/writings/fire/'>Ancient Fire: Poems and Translations</a> (2000)</li>
<li><a href='/writings/ismbook/'>The Ism Book: A Field Guide to Philosophy</a> (1996)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once in a while I also compose a stray <a href='/writings/essays/'>essay</a>, <a href='aphorisms.html'>aphorism</a>, or <a href='haiku.html'>haiku</a>.</p>
<p>I have made all of these works available in the <a href='/writings/essays/publicdomain.html'>public domain</a>, and have also published them in paperback and ebook formats via the <a href='http://www.monadnock.net/'>Monadnock Valley Press</a>.</p>
