<h2>The Power to Will</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
The will is neither absolutely bound nor free,<br/>
Instead it's a continuum from weak to strong&nbsp;&mdash;<br/>
Just as what's done from love is neither right nor wrong,<br/>
But lives beyond the bounds that good and evil see.
</p>
<p>
We use one word, yet will is many things combined:<br/>
There's what I leave behind and that toward which I'm drawn,<br/>
The sunset of the old, arriving at the dawn,<br/>
And always a commanding thought within the mind.
</p>
<p>
This tensing of the bow, this fixing on a goal,<br/>
Is felt within by what commands and what's commanded&nbsp;&mdash;<br/>
A subtle sense of living up to what's demanded<br/>
By that which is most excellent within the soul.
</p>
<p>
Although the will to power seems to hold most sway,<br/>
The power to will is that which finally rules the day.
