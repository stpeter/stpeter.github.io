<h2>The Hammer and the Bell</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
The hammer that he uses to philosophize<br/>
Just lightly taps our blind beliefs like empty bells&nbsp;&mdash;<br/>
Such as that life-denier Socrates was wise<br/>
Or that Jesus was the son of god, whose death tells
</p>
<p>
Us how to live on earth. The birth of what he treasures<br/>
Is firmly found in his refusal to conform<br/>
To idols he uncovers or to myths he measures.<br/>
Against these he arrays his thoughts where battles form
</p>
<p>
Between cold morals and the natural aims of life.<br/>
He knows that one who fully lives puts will in action,<br/>
But one who lacks such strength sets up an endless strife<br/>
By ever seeking from outside for satisfaction.
</p>
