<h2>Vivo, Ergo Cogito</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
Perhaps there is a finer fame<br/>
Than that attained by mere acclaim:<br/>
The glory of a higher goal;<br/>
The image of your deepest soul
</p>
<p>
Imprinted in a work or act;<br/>
Creation made a living fact;<br/>
An insight deep or deeply rare;<br/>
A greatness that you greatly share
</p>
<p>
Across the all too human ages<br/>
Among the all too human sages.<br/>
If so then nurture, as you strive,<br/>
What in your heart is most alive:
</p>
<p>
The path you climb, the craft you ply&nbsp;&mdash;<br/>
If you but learn to trust your eye<br/>
And ear, to seize what's ever near,<br/>
To honor what you hold most dear&nbsp;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Is glorious enough in scope<br/>
To bring to pass your highest hope.<br/>
Enforce within this law severe:<br/>
To live and think what you revere.
