<h2>Foreword: A Note to the Reader</h2>
<p><cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite> is a poetic record of my encounter with the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche.</p>
<p>Do not mistake it for what it is not: this cycle of poems is a work of literary philosophy, not academic scholarship. Each poem presents a highly distilled perspective on passages from Nietzsche's books, which are referenced at the bottom of each page. To understand the poems, it helps to read the original passages &mdash; for, as with aphorisms, so also with poems: they require exegesis.</p>
<p>The poems in this book are my own compositions, except for translations of the following poems by Nietzsche himself (printed in italics within the text):</p>
<ul>
  <li>"My Happiness"</li>
  <li>"Follow You, Follow Me"</li>
  <li>"For Dancers"</li>
  <li>"Upwards"</li>
  <li>"Narrow Souls"</li>
  <li>"Interpretation"</li>
  <li>"Without Envy"</li>
  <li>"Acclaim"</li>
  <li>"Ecce Homo"</li>
  <li>"Toward New Seas"</li>
</ul>
<p>And remember: a book of poems is like a box of chocolates — best not consumed in one sitting.</p>
<p>(cf. <cite>Ecce Homo</cite>, Preface, §1; <cite>On the Genealogy of Morals</cite>, Preface, §8)</p>
