<h2>Nietzsche as Educator</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
Redemption through a savior, thinker, artist, saint,<br/>
Betrays the principle of life and has the taint<br/>
Of laziness in cultivation of my mind<br/>
And soul. The goal, instead, is actively to bind
</p>
<p>
Myself to higher laws and to embrace the duties<br/>
Of honesty and truth, thus making real the beauties<br/>
Of consonance in life between ideal and deed.<br/>
The longing for what's excellent and rare will lead
</p>
<p>
Me to a way that only I can walk, a span<br/>
That only I can cross. The station that I man<br/>
Is savior of myself alone. For this he teaches:<br/>
To follow thoughts that are my own, not what he preaches.
