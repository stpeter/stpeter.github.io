<h2>The Free Spirit</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
I find a searching certainty,<br/>
A pale and subtle happiness,<br/>
Through discipline and mastery<br/>
(Experimenting here no less<br/>
In what I practice than in thought).<br/>
My birdlike flights in bracing air<br/>
And colder heights will, freely sought,<br/>
Help bring me knowledge hard and spare.
</p>
<p>
The certainties that I can find<br/>
Require endurance, strength, and vigor<br/>
In how I exercise my mind,<br/>
Reflection that is full of rigor,<br/>
A terseness and simplicity<br/>
Of thinking and deliberation;<br/>
These free me from authority<br/>
And lead me forth to liberation.
</p>
<p>
Although my certainties are few,<br/>
They cleanse and purify my mind<br/>
Of views not grounded in what's true.<br/>
Through joy and innocence combined<br/>
I come to live without vexation,<br/>
Reposing calmly in my soul;<br/>
My thoughts inspire moderation,<br/>
For they decide each act and goal.
</p>
<p>
With knowledge as my great intention,<br/>
I see things as they really stand.<br/>
Through knowing and a close attention<br/>
To what I need, I understand<br/>
Myself in ways both tough and tender.<br/>
Unchained from false desire, I see<br/>
Me as I am &mdash; and thus I render<br/>
My thinking and my spirit free.
