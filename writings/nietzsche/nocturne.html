<h2>Nocturne</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
Upon high mountains, sheer and steep,<br/>
Alone with nature I contend;<br/>
Surrounded by sublimity,<br/>
I wander worlds that have no end.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternity is long and deep;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I long for deep eternity.
</p>
<p>
Whenever I have made the leap<br/>
From certainty to paths unknown,<br/>
I've put a true integrity<br/>
In place as my foundation stone.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternity is long and deep;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I long for deep eternity.
</p>
<p>
The finest fruit that I can reap<br/>
Is harvested within the mind;<br/>
Wherever leads mentality,<br/>
The body follows close behind.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternity is long and deep;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I long for deep eternity.
</p>
<p>
Forsaking that which makes me weep,<br/>
I say a never-ending Yes;<br/>
My need is not security,<br/>
But qualities I choose to bless.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternity is long and deep;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I long for deep eternity.
</p>
<p>
If ever I have hoped to keep<br/>
A joy beyond its natural course,<br/>
Then I have willed infinity<br/>
And taken happiness by force.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternity is long and deep;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I long for deep eternity.
</p>
<p>
Eternity is long and deep,<br/>
With equal parts of joy and pain;<br/>
I long for deep eternity,<br/>
Since joy is what I strive to gain.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternity is long and deep;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I long for deep eternity.
