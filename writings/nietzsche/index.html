<h1>Songs of Zarathustra</h1>
<h2>Poetic Perspectives on Nietzsche's Philosophy of Life</h2>
<h2>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h2>
<p><a href='https://www.amazon.com/dp/0999186337'><img src="/images/songs-small.jpg" width="225" height="338" border="0" alt="Songs of Zarathustra" align="right"/></a>Although Friedrich Nietzsche is best known for his thunderous pronouncements about the death of god and the will to power, hidden within his writings is also a wealth of practical wisdom. <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite> condenses the heart of Nietzsche's ideas into a cycle of original poems, along with new translations of some of Nietzsche's own verse (marked below with an asterisk). Ordered chronologically from <cite>The Birth of Tragedy</cite> (1872) through <cite>Ecce Homo</cite> (1888), these poems track Nietzsche's growth as a thinker and writer. Above all, <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite> presents a fresh, positive perspective on Nietzsche's philosophy and its applications to living a full human life.</p>
<p>The book will always be available for free <a href='songs.html'>on this website</a>. <a href='https://www.amazon.com/dp/0999186337'>Paperback</a> and <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Songs-Zarathustra-Perspectives-Nietzsches-Philosophy-ebook/dp/B078TXBNF8/'>ebook</a> versions can be purchased at Amazon.<p>
