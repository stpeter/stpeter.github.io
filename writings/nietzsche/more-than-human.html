<h2>Human, More Than Human</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
Who is this overman, you ask?<br/>
Let's bring his image down to earth.<br/>
To say he has the greatest task<br/>
Or finds a way of giving birth
</p>
<p>
From chaos to a dancing star,<br/>
Unhelpfully is less than clear.<br/>
Yet we can see it isn't far<br/>
From overcoming guilt and fear
</p>
<p>
And other, all too human faults<br/>
To setting laws for just your soul&nbsp;&mdash;<br/>
To climbing up a path that vaults<br/>
You ever closer to your goal.
</p>
<p>
Lay on yourself the high demand<br/>
To learn the way of mastery;<br/>
Enforce within the self-command<br/>
That guides your life toward ecstasy.
</p>
