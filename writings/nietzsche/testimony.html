<h2>The Testimony of Dionysus</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
Although it's true he was the finest student that I taught,<br/>
His claim to be my best disciple doesn't square with facts<br/>
I can't ignore: he sought his liberation in his thought;<br/>
To him philosophy was like a Cretan double axe
</p>
<p>
He used to slay the frenzied states my worshippers hold dear;<br/>
You'd think perhaps he was a loyal student of Apollo<br/>
Because of how he venerated everything that's clear;<br/>
He made a synthesis so singular it's hard to follow.
</p>
<p>
And yet the very challenge that he sought through integration<br/>
Of elements of darkness and of light within the soul<br/>
Provides a model for a life of human elevation<br/>
And points toward achievement of each person's highest goal.
</p>
<p>
My verdict in the end is that he was a noble liar<br/>
Whose edifying poetry was made to tell a story<br/>
Of how an individual could reach for something higher<br/>
And so emerge from weakness into splendor, power, glory.
</p>
<p>THE END</p>
