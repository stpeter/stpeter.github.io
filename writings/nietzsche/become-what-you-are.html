<h2>Become What You Are</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
<p>
Allow the standard of each deed<br/>
To be a rare and true relation.<br/>
By nurturing a native seed,<br/>
You feed the source of elevation&nbsp;&mdash;<br/>
Feed courage, too, that has no need<br/>
For honors or for compensation.
</p>
<p>
Nobility is that which shows<br/>
A reverent, severe devotion<br/>
To higher gods that no one knows;<br/>
Its reason doesn't fear emotion<br/>
Or deepest health, which overflows<br/>
The limits of the widest ocean.
</p>
<p>
If you feel heat in what seems cold<br/>
And weigh your life on new-found scales,<br/>
You'll find the strength for yet more bold<br/>
Experiments and brave the gales<br/>
Of guilt and fear to hear an old<br/>
And inner voice that never fails.
</p>
<p>
With higher conscience as your star,<br/>
You'll grow into the one you are.
</p>
