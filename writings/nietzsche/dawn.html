<h2>The Dawn</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
Rise up! Rise up! The dawn is here!<br/>
Just as the glowing sun will bring<br/>
New truth, so too the soul will sing<br/>
A Yes beyond all pain and fear.
</p>
<p>
True certainty is hard to find,<br/>
But still I know enough to dance<br/>
With passion on the feet of chance,<br/>
A dance both joyous and refined.
</p>
<p>
With every step I go beyond<br/>
A human, all too human fate:<br/>
I learn and know but to create,<br/>
And make with those who work a bond
</p>
<p>
To cultivate, beget, and sow<br/>
A future earth that we can love.<br/>
We do not seek the stars above,<br/>
But most of all the world we know.
</p>
<p>
Rise up! Rise up! My will be done&nbsp;&mdash;<br/>
A will which through its work redeems<br/>
Both earthly life and noble dreams,<br/>
Which warms me like the morning sun.
