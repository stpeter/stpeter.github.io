<h2>The Masterwork</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
The masterwork of living is becoming who you are.<br/>
It's true you have a destiny, a task, an aim, a fate&nbsp;&mdash;<br/>
But it must slowly, surely grow from nebula to star,<br/>
Must long and hidden live unknown in some unfinished state.
</p>
<p>
It's best to have few notions about what your task may be:<br/>
Don't think you know yourself too soon, but let your form emerge.<br/>
Keep clear of great imperatives and purposes you see;<br/>
Float aimlessly toward new seas with every ebb and surge.
</p>
<p>
The roads you travel have their value, even if they're wrong;<br/>
Experience is the long and secret artistry of soul.<br/>
From all you do and all that's done a meaning will grow strong,<br/>
Mastering your life and self within a greater goal.
</p>
<p>
You need not struggle, strive, or will to reach a distant star,<br/>
But wish instead for just what is and rise to what you are.
