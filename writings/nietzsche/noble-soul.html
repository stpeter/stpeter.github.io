<h2>The Noble Soul</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
The self is made from many souls,<br/>
Of greater and of lesser worth,<br/>
Yet one is made to rule by birth:<br/>
The will of wills, the soul of souls.
</p>
<p>
The distance between high and low<br/>
Is stipulated from above:<br/>
The farthest sight and rarest love<br/>
Of what is best says Yes or No
</p>
<p>
To everything that's felt inside,<br/>
Thus honoring what it bestows.<br/>
A wealth of virtue overflows<br/>
In self-belief and inner pride
</p>
<p>
At mastery within the soul<br/>
Of courage, insight, sympathy,<br/>
And solitude &mdash; a certainty<br/>
That can't be lost or made a goal,
</p>
<p>
That overcomes all guilt and fears:<br/>
The noble soul itself reveres.
