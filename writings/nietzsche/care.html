<h2>The Care of the Self</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
Morality extends to how you flourish,<br/>
To how you cultivate your basic needs.<br/>
Consider, first, the means by which you nourish<br/>
Your body and its strength: for he who feeds
</p>
<p>
On hearty meals of flesh and fruit, who drinks<br/>
But tea and water, and who learns the measure<br/>
Of his body's needs &mdash; how could what he thinks<br/>
Be anything but bright and full of pleasure?
</p>
<p>
Consider, too, your settled choice of place:<br/>
Its air and wind, its atmosphere and light,<br/>
The full extent to which it gives you space<br/>
For clarity of thinking and of sight.
</p>
<p>
Consider, third, your forms of recreation,<br/>
The chosen means by which your soul is freed<br/>
From care and charged up for the liberation<br/>
Of powers you apply in thought and deed.
</p>
<p>
The three of these comprise the strongest sign<br/>
Of spirit's high command. For not to waste<br/>
Your energy maintains and helps align<br/>
Your daily actions with your finest taste.
