<h2>A Dialogue between Wanderer and Shadow</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
WANDERER<br/>
My shadow! Aren't you of my past,<br/>
That old, unreasoned dark of mine,<br/>
My weaknesses, my vanity?
</p>
<p>
SHADOW<br/>
I disagree: a shadow's cast<br/>
Whenever suns of knowledge shine.<br/>
I'm insight, not insanity.
</p>
<p>
WANDERER<br/>
If you bring light, then why so dark?<br/>
I need the lamp of knowledge less<br/>
Than positive success in action.
</p>
<p>
SHADOW<br/>
The joy of knowledge has its arc:<br/>
It doesn't yield full happiness,<br/>
And yet it does bring satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
WANDERER<br/>
Perhaps that's all I can expect;<br/>
And honesty demands no less<br/>
Than scrupulous integrity.
</p>
<p>
SHADOW<br/>
Plus justice, too, to not reject<br/>
But feel the freedom to confess<br/>
Your all too human quality.
</p>
<p>
WANDERER<br/>
This freedom makes a constant stranger:<br/>
I'm always moving past opinion,<br/>
The home of warm community.
</p>
<p>
SHADOW<br/>
It's true your path is full of danger.<br/>
And yet you have one true companion<br/>
To grant you some immunity.
</p>
<p>
WANDERER<br/>
For that I'm grateful, too, my friend.<br/>
To keep you close I seek the light<br/>
Of certainty, however weak.
</p>
<p>
SHADOW<br/>
I know I'm cold, but in the end<br/>
A nomad only has the right<br/>
To find as much as he can seek.
