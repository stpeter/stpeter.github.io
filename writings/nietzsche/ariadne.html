<h2>Ariadne's Requiem</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
To me, he was another son:<br/>
So close to what my husband taught,<br/>
So troubled, such a starry one&nbsp;&mdash;<br/>
Bull-headed, too, in how he fought.
</p>
<p>
His life was piled high with care,<br/>
With constant illness, pain, and trouble,<br/>
Beyond what normal mortals bear&nbsp;&mdash;<br/>
And borne alone, so sadly double.
</p>
<p>
And yet he overcame his fate:<br/>
Through power found within his hell<br/>
He rose up to a higher state,<br/>
A heaven only he could tell.
</p>
<p>
This heaven, though, was found on earth.<br/>
The thread I gave helped him escape<br/>
The labyrinth of human worth<br/>
And of its lack to finely shape
</p>
<p>
A higher faith, which celebrates<br/>
The joy and beauty humankind<br/>
Can seek and find &mdash; which liberates<br/>
Emotion, action, will, and mind.
</p>
<p>
He danced with life as best he could<br/>
And served the Muse to reach his goal:<br/>
To sing a more than human good<br/>
And cultivate a noble soul.
</p>
<p>[In Greek mythology, Ariadne was consort of Dionysus and goddess of the Minotaur's labyrinth on Crete.]</p>
