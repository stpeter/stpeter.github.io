<h2>Nature's Imperative</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
Just as the poet freely yokes his thoughts<br/>
To tyranny of rhythm and of rhyme,<br/>
You must obey what's best for time on time<br/>
Else you will lose respect for what you ought:
</p>
<p>
Your higher self, transfigured and refined.<br/>
If you subject your freedom and your strength<br/>
To ever higher laws you will at length<br/>
Be creature and creator both combined.
</p>
<p>
The paradox that order makes you free<br/>
Leads roundabout to everything of worth:<br/>
Art, virtue, reason, mastery of earth<br/>
And self, the discipline to clearly see.
</p>
<p>
The deep constraints you choose to cultivate<br/>
Make possible your drive for something great.
</p>
<p>(cf. <cite>Beyond Good and Evil</cite>, §188)</p>
