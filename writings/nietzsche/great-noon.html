<h2>The Great Noon</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
At noon the sun of knowledge stands at rest,<br/>
Halfway along its path to breaking day;<br/>
The world beneath its light lies ripe and blessed<br/>
By possibilities it might display.
</p>
<p>
Halfway from animal to something great,<br/>
Man too is fastened by the finest thread<br/>
To both the best and worst of earthly fate,<br/>
Yet goes to where enlightenment has led.
</p>
<p>
Keep true to what your life so well provides:<br/>
The smallest, lightest things that heal the heart.<br/>
For in the kingdom of the earth abides<br/>
A goodness in which all such things take part.
</p>
<p>(cf. <cite>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</cite>, "Of the Bestowing Virtue", "Of the Virtue that Makes Small", "Of the Three Evil Things", "At Noontide", "Of the Higher Man")</p>
