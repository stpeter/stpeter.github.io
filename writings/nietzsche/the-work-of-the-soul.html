<h2>The Work of the Soul</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
What, rightly seen, is being wise<br/>
But virtue in the ancient sense:<br/>
The strength of mind to supervise<br/>
Emotion and the future tense
</p>
<p>
Of how I think and choose and act,<br/>
The power to adjudicate<br/>
Between the claims of wish and fact,<br/>
And thus to mold and shape my fate.
</p>
<p>
This height's not easy to achieve,<br/>
So I might seek a shorter path<br/>
In god or faith &mdash; might self-deceive<br/>
And try to cheat the brutal math
</p>
<p>
Of greater work and countless hours<br/>
Spent practicing at depth and length<br/>
The cultivation of my powers<br/>
Of self-command and moral strength.
</p>
<p>
The inner beauty I refine<br/>
Through harmony of task and soul<br/>
Demands my best: I both define<br/>
And represent my highest goal.
