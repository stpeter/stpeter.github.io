<h2>Far and Near</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
The hands of those who legislate<br/>
Direct you to what's far away:<br/>
Salvation, science, riches, state,<br/>
The things that by convention pay.
</p>
<p>
Instead consider what is near<br/>
To be your weightiest concern<br/>
And focus your attention here:<br/>
Apply your powers and discern
</p>
<p>
What benefits you in the way<br/>
You interact with foe and friend,<br/>
The best division of the day,<br/>
Reflection on the time you spend
</p>
<p>
In work and leisure, art and play,<br/>
In nature and society,<br/>
In what you rule and what obey,<br/>
In courage and propriety.
</p>
<p>
The body has its wisdom, too:<br/>
Philosophy applies to sleep,<br/>
To what you eat, to what you do<br/>
In daily life &mdash; this too is deep
</p>
<p>
And subject to a higher code<br/>
Of individuality.<br/>
By following your natural mode,<br/>
You ground your own morality.
</p>
