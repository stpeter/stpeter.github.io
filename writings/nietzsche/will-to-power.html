<h2>The Will to Power</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
Philosophers and priests, who claim to be the wise,<br/>
Assert that human life is beastly, mindless, low,<br/>
And lacks the higher things they see. They demonize<br/>
The will and drive to live and thrive, to be and grow,
</p>
<p>
Unless it has their moral sanction from above.<br/>
But man and earth require nothing that's beyond,<br/>
No realm outside our world of nature, life, and love&nbsp;&mdash;<br/>
Of change, becoming, growth, and every human bond.
</p>
<p>
The strongest human spirit labors, thinks, and feels<br/>
With confidence and overflowing energy,<br/>
With beauty and with joy; it doesn't need ideals<br/>
Beyond its love of life, its natural certainty.
</p>
<p>
And yet perhaps we need a goal to help oppose<br/>
Ascetic fallacies. The life of man on earth,<br/>
Acceptance of the values we must presuppose<br/>
To follow an ascending arc of depth and worth,
</p>
<p>
A celebration of the senses and the mind,<br/>
A love for that which elevates the human soul,<br/>
For what completes the best potential of mankind&nbsp;&mdash;<br/>
These are the ways and means, the meaning and the goal.
</p>
<p>
The will to power is the feeling of command<br/>
That comes from your ability to thrive and act.<br/>
By forging virtue through your strength of mind and hand,<br/>
You justify your ways in every living fact.
