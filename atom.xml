    <summary>A few years ago I read an excellent book entitled Grief: A Philosophical Guide by Michael Cholbi. Since then, events in my life have led me to reflect further on the several varieties of grieving experience, as William James might have phrased it. Foremost in my mind are anticipatory grief (mental, emotional, and spiritual adjustment to a future loss, such as loss of parents) and ambiguous grief (adjustment to a loss that is difficult to understand or resolve, such as a loved one's incapacitation because of dementia)....</summary>

    <summary>In most of the ancient philosophical communities, the figure of the sage was held up as the ideal to which a budding lover of wisdom should rightly aspire. This was true of Confucianism, Pythagoreanism, Stoicism, Buddhism, Taoism, Pyrrhonism, Epicureanism, and the various "schools" inspired by the example of Socrates, including the "think tanks" and voluminous works of Plato and Aristotle....</summary>

    <summary>Because today is Constitution Day, I figured it would appropriate to share a few reflections on what it is to be an American. Apparently that's a thing these days! But in fact it's been a thing since at least 1781, when J. Hector St. Jean de Crevecoeur published his essay What Is an American....</summary>

    <summary>In Ayn Rand's novel The Fountainhead, the villainous intellectual Ellsworth Toohey shamelessly states his attitude to other people: "I play the stock market of the soul - and I sell short." Because you can't go too far wrong by doing the exact opposite of what a wicked character like Toohey does, I've been thinking about what it means to buy long in human relationships....</summary>

    <summary>While reading yet another book by Pierre Hadot recently, I came across a fascinating passage from the ancient Greek writer Plutarch about philosophy as a way of life. Here's the crux of it, in my own translation:...</summary>
