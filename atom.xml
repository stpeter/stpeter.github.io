    <summary>I've just started reading David Hackett Fischer's massive book African Founders: How Enslaved People Expanded American Ideals, a worthy follow-up to the magisterial Albion's Seed (which I also happen to be re-reading as background to my in-progress poem "Song of the Nations"). In the introduction, Fischer cites three rules for historical research that were originally formulated by Francis Parkman: "Go There", "Do It", and "Write It" (advice that Parkman followed in spades, for example in his well-known work on the Oregon Trail)....</summary>

    <summary>About 2500 year ago, Heraclitus said: "the way upward and the way downward are one and the same" (Fragment 60). As always with the enigmatic and evocative fragments of Heraclitus - I've written before about his statement that "you can't step into the same river twice" - there are multiple interpretations of this one, from the mundane (the road up a mountain is the same as the road down a mountain) to the mystical (humanity's way up to god is the same as god's way down to humanity). For today I'd like to link this saying to the Aristotelian theme of practical wisdom (φρόνησις)....</summary>

    <summary>The recent death of philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre has prompted numerous assessments of his work (which, I'll admit, I have not looked at in decades - an oversight that I plan to remedy soon because of his status as perhaps the most prominent neo-Aristotelian thinker of the last fifty years). Several of the remembrances I've read expressed frustration with the lack of specificity in MacIntyre's political philosophy, which boils down to what my college professor Charles Larmore called "polis envy": the desire to construct communities on the model of the ancient Greek city-states, in which all the citizens worked together for the sake of a common purpose and a common vision of the good life. Only in such a setting, says MacIntyre, can human beings lead an ethically flourishing life....</summary>
