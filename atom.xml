    <summary>We all know the story of Romeo and Juliet, that pair of star-crossed lovers who through a series of mishaps and misunderstandings end up committing suicide. Yet amidst the tragedy and the romance we pay less attention to the civic background: duelling families whose constant strife seriously jeopardizes the peace in the Verona of old. Both the prince and the people are fed up with the Capulets and the Montagues; in Shakespeare's rendering, when the prince's kinsman Mercutio is mortally albeit unintentionally wounded by Romeo in yet another street fight, he cries out "a plague on both your houses!"...</summary>

    <summary>Following up on my recent post about Plato's Laches and Aristotle's Ethics, I've continued to ponder the need they identified to provide an account for how you live. Although I'm still researching the relevant texts, it appears that Aristotle at least identified such a need in all five of the traits of mind that he discusses: craft, understanding, insight, wisdom, and sagacity (see my Aristotelian glossary for more about these terms). Here is a sketch of my findings so far....</summary>

    <summary>Over the last few months I've taken up a new practice: reading with friends. The concept is simple: choose a friend, choose a book, slowly read it, and share thoughts on each chapter as you go along. It's kind of like pair programming for intellectual exploration....</summary>

    <summary>In Plato's dialogue Laches, Lysimachus and Melesias are searching for someone to teach their sons about courage, so they engage the Athenian generals Laches and Nikias in conversation, with Socrates participating alongside. Socrates encourages Lysimachus to seek an account (logos) of virtue from Laches and Nikias, since they are older and presumably wiser than Socrates himself. When Lysimachus agrees that this is a good idea, Nikias makes a fascinating observation:...</summary>

    <summary>Aristotle is well-known for having pioneered our vocabulary of potentiality and actualization. An especially meaningful form of human potentiality or capacity is what he calls a hexis: a stable, voluntarily acquired trait that, when applied, results in reliable activity of a certain kind. Aristotle identifies three such primary traits in human life: virtue or excellence of character (aretē), knowledge or understanding (epistēmē), and craft or skill (technē)....</summary>
