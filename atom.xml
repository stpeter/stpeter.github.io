    <summary>When Socrates was put on trial in Athens for corrupting the youth, part of his defense was that he never requested payment for attending to the concerns of other people and encouraging them to live a more virtuous, examined life; instead he came to people individually "like a father or elder brother" (Plato, Apology, 31b), acting out of care for their souls. In a little-noted passage in Nicomachean Ethics IX.1 (1164a33-b6), Aristotle seems to expand on this line of thinking. First he observes that in relationships founded on excellence of character - such as, say, the relationship of parent to child or elder sibling to younger sibling - the parties engage in good deeds toward each other and return favors through their own free choice and mutual commitment. Drawing an analogy between interpersonal love and the love of wisdom, he then says:...</summary>

    <summary>In his classic book Seeing Like a State, James C. Scott describes numerous schemes by which what he calls "high-modernist" planners attempted to impose order on the perceived chaos of human societies: collectivized farms in Soviet Russia, compulsory villagization in parts of Africa, unworkable cities like Brasília, etc. All of these schemes to overcome the messy realities of human existence have been able to survive their own manifest failings only because of creative workarounds discovered through human inventiveness and practical know-how (which, borrowing an ancient Greek word that Homer used to describe the wily Odysseus, he calls mētis / μῆτις)....</summary>

    <summary>While talking with a friend today, I described my concept of the "to don't list" as well as a few of my personal best practices related to smartphone usage. In the midst of our conversation, it occurred to me that there's such a thing as a good distraction. It's difficult for even the most disciplined person to stay focused all the time on long-term projects and personal productivity. We all need a mental break! Yet, speaking from experience, all too often I'm wont to pull out my smartphone or computer and check the headlines, even though I've been on a low-information diet for 10-15 years and intellectually I know the news isn't helpful for my state of mind. At least for me, this a bad distraction!...</summary>

    <summary>Several friends I've talked with recently have expressed despair over the results of the recent U.S. elections, disbelief over Donald Trump's picks for cabinet roles, even a desire to move to Canada or Europe - plus a kind of wonder that I'm able to maintain my equanimity in what they see as a dire situation. In case it might prove helpful to other folks, I'll try to describe my mindset....</summary>
