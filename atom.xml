    <summary>Advocates of modern eudaimonism and the "true self" place great value on individual uniqueness. Consider David L. Norton in his 1976 book Personal Destinies (p. 16):...</summary>

    <summary>Here are the eighty-odd books I chanced to read in 2022, with links to ones in the public domain that I've posted in full or in part at my Monadnock site. Right now I'm also a third of the way through War and Peace, but there's no way I'll finish it by the end of the year......</summary>

    <summary>This was a big year for uploading public-domain works to the Monadnock Valley Press - likely the biggest year since I founded the site in 2008.

Forster, Robert Herrick, Hesiod, Robert Hillyer, Langston Hughes, David Hume, Henrik Ibsen, William James, Robinson Jeffers, Ben Jonson, Emma Lazarus, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Lucretius, Christopher Marlowe, Herman Melville, John Stuart Mill, John Milton, Michel de Montaigne, Kakuzo Okakura, Richard Overton, Walter Pater, Plutarch, Sir Walter Raleigh, Laura Riding, Edwin Arlington Robinson, Bertrand Russell, William Shakespeare, Sophocles, Baruch Spinoza, Wallace Stevens, Sara Teasdale, Henry David Thoreau, Leo Tolstoy, Virgil, Voltaire, George Washington, John Greenleaf Whittier, and Xenophon. Whew!...</summary>

    <summary>Aristotle is famous for his so-called doctrine of the mean: a particular excellence of character is not the opposite of a single fault (e.g., courage vs. cowardice) but is intermediate between excess and defect (e.g., courage is opposed to both rashness and cowardice). Although some scholars never go deeper than this surface understanding, as I see it "that which is intermediate" (τὸ μέσον) is merely a first approximation to excellence, because there's an awful lot of space in the middle between going far beyond the mean and falling far short of it....</summary>

    <summary>One of the key themes of Tolstoy's War and Peace (which I'm currently reading for the first time) is self-deception. The reader quickly perceives that Nikolai Rostov, Andrei Bolkonsky, and many other characters are fooling themselves about their own worth, thoughts, and actions. There is a connection here to a famous quote from Tolstoy:...</summary>

    <summary>The collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire at FTX and Alameda Research has cast a shadow over the "effective altruism" movement, of which he was a major financer. Ironically, I would argue that in the end he failed at altruism because he was an ineffective egoist!...</summary>
