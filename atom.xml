    <summary>My increasingly strong commitment to personalism and particularism has prompted me to make some changes in how I read, think, and act. Specifically, I have taken to translating universal claims and observations into practices that I can apply in my own life (and ignoring them if they cannot be so translated)....</summary>

    <summary>Once more unto the breach with Santayana! (Three posts in a day on this topic were not what I expected.) Before saying goodbye to him, at least for now, I thought it would be fun to look at his use - or abuse - of Shakespeare at a crucial point in The Sense of Beauty. As Santayana leads up to this definition of beauty, he quotes Sonnet 54, which runs as follows:...</summary>

I would never claim that art serves only a contemplative function, for as I mentioned in a paper I wrote twenty years ago art can do many things.
