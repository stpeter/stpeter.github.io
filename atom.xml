    <summary>My increasingly strong commitment to personalism and particularism has prompted me to make some changes in how I read, think, and act. Specifically, I have taken to translating universal claims and observations into practices that I can apply in my own life (and ignoring them if they cannot be so translated)....</summary>

    <summary>Beauty is not limited to the arts (indeed, art is not always beautiful, but that's another topic). This set me to thinking about the many sorts of things that we humans can call beautiful:...</summary>

    <summary>Once more unto the breach with Santayana! (Three posts in a day on this topic were not what I expected.) Before saying goodbye to him, at least for now, I thought it would be fun to look at his use - or abuse - of Shakespeare at a crucial point in The Sense of Beauty. As Santayana leads up to this definition of beauty, he quotes Sonnet 54, which runs as follows:...</summary>

    <summary>Continuing my reflections on Santayana's aesthetics, I've been thinking about the contemplative significance of the arts. It's no surprise that this connection would stand out for me, given the contemplative turn I have been exploring over the last few years. I would never claim that art serves only a contemplative function, for as I mentioned in a paper I wrote twenty years ago art can do many things. Yet I think Santayana identifies something important when he observes that aesthetic experience can settle the soul, enable us to stand outside the confusions of our ephemeral existence, and bring us inner peace....</summary>

    <summary>Despite my harsh words the other day about the foundations of Santayana's aesthetics, even partway into The Sense of Beauty I could tell that some of his more particular insights would be worthy of serious consideration. That indeed has proved to be the case, specifically in the form of his summations late in the book regarding the role of art in human life....</summary>

    <summary>Apparently Substack has something called the Sunshine Blogger Awards, wherein writers are tagged to answer eleven questions of the tagger's choosing. Although I haven't been tagged, reading a few such posts set me to thinking, so here are eleven questions to ponder, along with my own answers....</summary>
