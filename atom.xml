    <summary>People sometimes ask me what I think about Stoicism (not the phenomenon of physical and emotional fortitude, which I would call stoicism with a small "s", but the Greco-Roman philosophical school that has undergone a recent revival). At the risk of alienating those of my readers who lean in the direction of Stoicism, I've decided to write a few blog posts on the topic, starting with this one....</summary>

    <summary>When we think of philosophy, we tend to think of theoretical philosophy: cloistered academics, armchair thinkers, and dreamy contemplatives arguing over the fine points of abstruse topics that have little if any practical import. This reputation is, unfortunately, well-deserved, especially in recent times. Yet if we accept the validity of philosophy as a way of life, then these "big idea people" fall short of the ideal. There's a significant difference between the love of ideas for their own sake and the love of wisdom for the sake of livng well. I'm not saying you can't combine the two, but the second is more valuable than the first because it is the foundation not just for intellectual fascination but for human flourishing. I discussed related matters in a talk I gave at the University of Colorado a few years ago, entitled "You're Majoring in What?!? Why Philosophy is a Foundation for Success"......</summary>

    <summary>Recently I came across a study entitled "Longevity increased by positive self-perceptions of aging" (Levy et al. 2002 - apparently Becca Levy has a new book out entitled Breaking the Age Code, which I have not read yet). The abstract states: "This research found that older individuals with more positive self-perceptions of aging, measured up to 23 years earlier, lived 7.5 years longer than those with less positive self-perceptions of aging. This advantage remained after age, gender, socioeconomic status, loneliness, and functional health were included as covariates." As Spock would say: fascinating!...</summary>

    <title>Philosophical Forms and Functions</title>

    <summary>Following up on my post a few months ago about philosophical professionalism, I've been thinking about the many forms of philosophical writing and their functions in our intellectual and practical life. Throughout history, philosophical questions and answers have been presented in so many written forms: aphorisms, dialogues, essays, letters, allegories, parables, stories, novels, plays, poems, lectures, sermons, manifestos, journals, memoirs, biographies, autobiographies, epitomes, proofs, puzzles, thought experiments, dissertations, treatises, and scholarly papers. Yet it's only the last few of these that are acceptable these days in academic philosophy. Even a widely-cited essay like Thomas Nagel's "What Is it Like to Be a Bat?" probably wouldn't get published in an academic journal these days, and that's a shame....</summary>
