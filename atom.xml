    <summary>As I mentioned a few months ago in my post "Idealism and Identity", personal identity is, paradoxically, often a social construct. Here I'd like to dig more deeply into why that's the case, but without straying too far into theoretical matters because I like to provide practical insights in my blog posts....</summary>

    <summary>A friend asked me recently if I think that self-improvement is selfish. My short answer was that building up your character is a matter of cultivating your higher self rather than gratifying your lower self, so this activity might exist beyond the dichotomy of egoism vs. altruism....</summary>

    <summary>If you tell people that you're interested in philosophy, inevitably someone will ask you about the meaning of life. Although the question might predate The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, ancient philosophers in the Greek, Indian, and Chinese traditions didn't raise it. Personally I adhere to the aphorism that it's best not to puzzle over the meaning of life, but instead work to create a life of meaning....</summary>

    <summary>While doing some research recently on relationships, I came across an old but classic scholarly paper entitled "The Rules of Friendship" by Michael Argyle and Monika Henderson (Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, Vol. 1 (1984), pp. 211-237). Using populations from Britain, Italy, Hong Kong, and Japan, the authors studied several related topics:...</summary>

    <summary>What is the self? Naturally this question invokes vast reflections spanning philosophy, psychology, cognitive science, sociology, biology, and many other fields. Although I claim no special insight, in my Aristotle readings over the last few years I chanced upon a fascinating perspective that I thought I'd share....</summary>

    <summary>As mentioned in my post "Delphic Wisdom and Modern Science", on the walls of the ancient Greek temple at Delphi could be found the inscription μηδὲν ἄγαν, meaning "nothing too much". Yet how can one know how much is enough? Naturally it's hard to say precisely - after all, if it were easy, life wouldn't be so messy and complicated, now would it?...</summary>
