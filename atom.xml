    <summary>One of the key themes of Tolstoy's War and Peace (which I'm currently reading for the first time) is self-deception. The reader quickly perceives that Nikolai Rostov, Andrei Bolkonsky, and many other characters are fooling themselves about their own worth, thoughts, and actions. There is a connection here to a famous quote from Tolstoy:...</summary>

    <summary>The collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire at FTX and Alameda Research has cast a shadow over the "effective altruism" movement, of which he was a major financer. Ironically, I would argue that in the end he failed at altruism because he was an ineffective egoist!...</summary>

    <summary>While reading about the recent protests in China against the government's Zero Covid policy (and, more generally, the totalitarian surveillance state established by the Chinese Communist Party), I was reminded of a fascinating quote from logician Kurt GÃ¶del extending the results of his Incompleteness Theorem to matters of society and governance:...</summary>

    <title>Can a Nietzschean Be a Feminist?</title>

    <summary>In one of my earliest blog posts (written in 1996!), I explained why I'm a female chauvinist. This attitude can be hard to square with my mostly positive perspective on Friedrich Nietzsche, which I explored in my book Songs of Zarathustra. After all, Nietzsche is notorious for spewing vitriol and venom regarding the role of women in modern society. Unfortunately, this is something that his admirers often prefer to sweep under the rug....</summary>

    <summary>Back in 2015, I co-authored an IETF specification (RFC 7525) describing best practices for the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) on the Internet. Much has happened since then: new security vulnerabilities, new deployment scenarios, and especially a new version of the TLS protocol (RFC 8446, published in August 2018). Thus it was time for us to define updated recommendations, which Yaron Sheffer, Thomas Fossati, and I have just done in RFC 9325. For more detailed information about the changes we made, take a few minutes to read Yaron's blog post....</summary>

    <summary>Over the last few months I've blatantly but deliberately gone off my low-information diet - not because I suddenly feel a need to be highly informed, but because I'm advising Otherweb, a startup that aims to fix the world's information ecosystem by presenting only those news stories that are provably lacking in sensationalistic language, partisan fervor, and other manipulative techniques.
