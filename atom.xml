    <summary>Did you know that Socrates' 2500th birthday will occur in 2032? Lately I've been pondering the possibility of writing by then an intellectual biography of Socrates....</summary>

    <summary>Following on our investigation last week of the ancient Greek maxim "Know Thyself", I thought it might be interesting to explain another Greek phrase that has gained currency in recent times: "Become What You Are"....</summary>

    <summary>The saying γνῶθι σαυτόν ("know thyself") was prominently displayed at the temple of Delphi, where ancient Greeks, Romans, Persians, and others sought answers to their most pressing questions. Yet what is it exactly to know thyself? Essential clues can be found in an obscure little book published in 1916: "Know Thyself" in Greek and Latin Literature, in which Eliza Gregory Wilkins collected almost all mentions of the maxim up until the fall of Rome....</summary>

    <summary>Much of what makes human beings distinctive is what Jacob Bronowski called "a sense of the future" (in addition to his old book by that name, see also more recently Homo Prospectus by Seligman, Railton, Baumeister, and Sripada). Certainly most animals can think at least a few minutes or maybe hours in advance, but they're not actively planning months or years ahead of time as humans can. Yet, perhaps under the influence of modern science, our conception of our intellectual capacities is often retrospective: reason is thought to be a faculty that formulates accurate conclusions and stable laws from the evidence we have painfully gathered in the past through induction, experiment, and the like....</summary>
