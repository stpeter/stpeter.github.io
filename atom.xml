    <summary>Because labor is so central to human existence, throughout history various thinkers have speculated about what the Buddhist eightfold path calls "right livelihood" for those who would seek and practice wisdom. For instance, both the Stoic Musonius Rufus and the Confucian Wu Yubi advocated subsistence farming as a noble line of work. The Taoist sage Chuang Tzu tells a beautiful story about the artistry of a lowly butcher. Although officially Aristotle downplayed the value of mechanical pursuits like housebuilding and even music-making, nevertheless he frequently used craftsmen as models of practical thinking and he applied the lessons of craftsmanship to ethical reflection. In recent times, Matthew Crawford titled one of his books "shop class as soul craft" and has argued that working in the trades enables you to bring your whole self to your productive activities.

    <summary>Having last week explored what philosophers do, I thought I'd broaden that theme by looking at ways of life in general, not only philosophy as a way of life....</summary>

    <summary>Three weeks ago I had the honor of being interviewed by Sal Inglima of Boston Free Radio for his Open Readings show. We had a great time talking about the fine art of poetry translation. Sal read aloud my translation of a German poem about the eve of World War II by philosopher Walter Kaufmann and I read my translation of Sappho fragment 16 as well as two of my own poems: Ancient Fire (from the eponymous collection) and Brief Wisdom (from Songs of Zarathustra, my book about Friedrich Nietzsche). Enjoy!...</summary>

    <summary>If philosophy is a way of life, then what are the characteristic activities of philosophers? (I mean, of course, not professors of philosophy, but people who love and practice the minerval arts of wisdom.)...</summary>

    <summary>In pursuit of wisdom, I often explore intellectual traditions I'm not familiar with. Most recently, I've been reading a sourcebook of Japanese philosophy, in which I found a fascinating essay by Abe Masao (1915-2006) on the Buddhist concept of emptiness or nothingness....</summary>

    <summary>Determinism - the belief that all events (including animal behavior and human actions) are fixed or ordained by antecedent conditions or external forces before they happen - doesn't keep me up at night, but it seems to be something of a bogeyman for many people. To my mind, it's a fantastical notion. Here's how I perceive the argument for this belief:...</summary>
