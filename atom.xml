    <summary>The longer I study and practice philosophy, the more value I find in a wide variety of wisdom traditions. When I first became interested in philosophy at the age of 12, it was exclusively in the form of Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism. About this philosophy I was, at least throughout my teenage years, thoroughly dogmatic: all the other philosophies were riddled with error - not even worth considering - and Rand's philosophy simply was philosophy as far as I was concerned. (To be clear, the fault was not Rand's but my own - I could have been just as dogmatic about Stoicism or existentialism.)...</summary>

    <summary>The other day I observed that, in the balance between mindlessly using technology and deliberately honoring people's humanity (including my own), I tilt toward more humanity. But how does that cash out in everyday life?...</summary>

    <summary>Epicurus once said: "Understand that a long discourse and a short one both achieve the same result." Although that's standard advice for writers (Yevgeny Zamyatin counselled "writing with 90-proof ink"), few follow it. Many books could have been long articles, many long articles could have been blog posts, and many blog posts could have been aphorisms. My journal entries average around 400 words these days, and I limit my books to around 100 pages. This is simple respect for you, the reader. Besides, I'd rather provoke difficult questions than provide definitive answers, because only you can answer those questions for yourself, anyway. Perhaps loving wisdom involves respecting your wisdom as much as my own......</summary>

    <summary>Last year around this time I posted a few thoughts on Socrates and Thoreau, specifically regarding the likely influence of a passage in Book VI of Plato's Republic on Thoreau's attitude toward mere professors of philosophy, who unlike true philosophers do not live according to the dictates of wisdom. The other day, while re-reading key passages in Plato's dialogues as part of my research on Aristotle, I suddenly realized that on the very next page in the 1804 edition of Plato's works that Thoreau borrowed from Emerson can be found the inspiration for Thoreau's attitude toward the news, best encapsulated in an aphorism from his essay Life Without Principle: "Read not the Times. Read the Eternities."...</summary>

    <summary>I was saddened yesterday to learn (via my friend Wayne Bethanis) that pianist-composer George Winston has died. Every solo performer of original music - not just pianists but guitarists and everyone else - owes him a debt of gratitude, for he was one of the few who blazed the trail of modern instrumental music, starting with his album Autumn in 1980. Although his music was often called "new age", he preferred the evocative term "rural folk piano". Many streams came together in his music: folk, blues, jazz, classical, rock, gospel, rhythm and blues, Hawaiian, and more. Yet he fused them into a seamless whole that was uniquely his own....</summary>
