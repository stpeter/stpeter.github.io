    <summary>As previously mentioned, I am skeptical about the notion of the true self. Recently I've done some reading that has reinforced this skepticism. In particular, research by the likes of Roy Baumeister shows that human beings tend to identify with the activities and desires that they think are best (either individually or socially) and to disown the activities and desires that they think aren't so admirable....</summary>

    <summary>One of the things I do to avoid exposure to the news is immerse myself in poetry. Most recently I've been reading English and American poets from the 1500s and 1600s, such as Anne Bradstreet, Samuel Daniel, and Thomas Traherne.

    <summary>Existentialist philosophers insist on the ability - indeed, the responsibility - for human beings to create themselves. This is the import of Sartre's famous formulation "existence precedes essence": there is no human essence, and if you believe so then you are engaging in "bad faith" and living inauthentically....</summary>

    <summary>Here are the eighty-odd books I chanced to read in 2022, with links to ones in the public domain that I've posted in full or in part at my Monadnock site. Right now I'm also a third of the way through War and Peace, but there's no way I'll finish it by the end of the year......</summary>
