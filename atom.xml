    <summary>A while back I learned of a poet and historian named Peter Viereck (1916-2006), who not only won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1949 but also wrote insightful books of social and literary criticism in the American individualist tradition of Emerson, Thoreau, and Randolph Bourne. In his now-forgotten book The Unadjusted Man, published in 1956, Viereck celebrated the kind of person who dodges the pressures of conformity (what he called "overadjustment") to maintain a measure of intellectual independence. Here is a fine passage about one path to becoming an "unadjusted man":...</summary>

    <summary>Several factors have conspired recently to slow down my pace of posting. Not only have I been working through a difficult and distracting family matter, but I've been questioning some of my existing commitments. Among other things, I've decided to conclude my philosophical coaching and startup advising activities. Although these were intriguing experiments and I enjoyed working with several people, I have my doubts about how truly helpful I was; more generally, I doubt that I am cut out for the helping professions. As a result, I'll be shutting down my philosopher.coach website and in the future posting only at stpeter.im (however, I won't rule out a move to Substack, at least for some of my mid-length writings)....</summary>

    <summary>Most of our metaphors for knowing and thinking are based on the power of sight; for instance, the ancient Greek word eidenai means "to have seen", i.e., the past perfect of idein (whence our word "idea"). Less commonly, knowing is held to come from hearing what is said - especially hearing the word of god as in the Hebrew tradition. Yet all indications are that music predates language. What depths of wisdom could we sound if we were to base our metaphors on actively and collaboratively making music? Consider some of the primeval phenomena of music: the living pulse of rhythm and its resulting entrainment of the music makers; the importance of harmony,  both internal and interpersonal; the striving, movement, and completion of melodies and chord progressions. Beyond these fundamentals there is much more to explore: timbre and coloration in different instruments and keys, consonance and dissonance, the stretching of time in rubato and syncopation, tempo and its relation to human activities and emotions, improvisation and spontaneity, active listening and responding as crucial to cooperative music-making, making music as a form of meditation, and much else besides. I intend to ponder these matters as I delve more deeply into music in the years ahead....</summary>

    <summary>By my count, I was able to read 95 books this year, not even accounting for the three epic poems I read twice: the Iliad, the Odyssey, and Beowulf. Highlights were the plays of Shakespeare (yes, all of them), George Eliot's magisterial novel Middlemarch, Bach and the Patterns of Invention by Laurence Dreyfus, an intensive re-reading of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, my friend Dave Jilk's poetic SF novel Epoch, and the aforementioned epic poems. I expect that I'll not read nearly so many books in 2025 while I attempt to finish writing my book about Aristotle's conception of human fulfillment....</summary>

    <summary>Before I go deep on Aristotle, I figured I'd mention something I've been thinking about lately, which is aesthetics. Following up on some research I've been doing into the music of J.S. Bach for my "Meditations on Bach" project, I recently read a book about the founders of modern aesthetics during the German Enlightenment (Christian Wolff, Alexander Baumgarten, etc.). It turns out that these early thinkers saw aesthetics as a practical discipline; unlike post-Kantian philosophers of art who are interested in purely theoretical questions or, at best, epistemological justification of critical judgment, the originators of aesthetics wanted to spell out principles that would guide artists in the task of bringing more beauty into the world. Immediately I perceived parallels to philosophy as the personal love and practice of wisdom. Consulting my ancient Greek dictionary, I discovered the word φιλοκαλία / philokalia, which I would describe as the personal love and practice of beauty. This is a fascinating topic that I've sketched out in slightly more detail in a work-in-progress essay (I even subtitled it a "manifesto"), but I won't have time to dig into it much further until I complete my Aristotle book. So many projects, so little time......</summary>

    <summary>Although I don't make New Year's resolutions, inevitably one does think about priorities as the year winds down. One realization I've come to recently is that I need to finish off more of my long-term projects. Because my Aristotle book is the farthest along (I've been researching it for five years!), I'm recommitting to it in hopes of completing a first draft by the end of 2025. This means that I'll have to cut back somewhat on blogging, pair reading, public-domain publishing at the Monadnock Valley Press, catching up on news and long-form cultural analysis, etc. Instead, I'll be reviewing the book and article summaries I've created, improving the outline, drafting and honing the text, identifying chapter epigraphs, and so on. Where appropriate, I'll continue to use my weblog to work out my thinking on various Aristotelian themes; however, I might be posting less frequently on other topics....</summary>
