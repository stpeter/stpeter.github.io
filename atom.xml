    <summary>Following up on yesterday's post about the Tao Te Ching, here's another poem that I might set to music (chapter 11 in the standard order). My provisional rendering is as follows:...</summary>

    <summary>For many years I have admired, and puzzled over, the Tao Te Ching. This classic text of Chinese philosophy is wise, poetic, suggestive, paradoxial, even inscrutable. Because I don't know classical Chinese, I'm forced to read multiple translations - a task made easy by the fact that it's one of the most translated works in all of world literature. Yet, not knowing the original language, I'm always unsure whether I really understand its message. It's one of my "best friend books" and I return to it every few years....</summary>

    <summary>About 600 years ago, some farsighted intellectual explorers in Europe created a long-distance communication network they called the Republic of Letters; indeed, it was almost something like a network of networks (an internet!), since it connected local networks in various towns and cities with each other. The way it worked is that individual people would exchange handwritten letters and manuscripts, and eventually printed pamphlets and books, with correspondents in other parts of the network. Those correspondents would then write back to the original sender and also share insights with others to whom they were connected (whether local or distant). It was also expected that participants would help to grow the network by recruiting new members. This network, which flourished from about 1400 to 1800, played a significant role in fostering the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the early Industrial Revolution....</summary>

    <summary>Not only do I read a lot, but I also re-read a lot. For instance, so far this year I've re-read the sonnets and a few plays by Shakespeare, three novels by Victor Hugo, the complete poems of Emily Dickinson, several Plato dialogues, and a few of my favorite children's books (The Wonderful O by James Thurber and The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton O. Juster); plus I'm in the midst of re-reading The Importance of Living by Lin Yutang as well as the Tao Te Ching....</summary>

    <summary>Twelve years ago when I was in Taipei for a weeklong standardization meeting, I snuck off one morning to visit the former home of Lin Yutang, where I bought a copy of his 1937 masterpiece The Importance of Living. Every few years I dip into this book, and each time I'm reminded of things I never should have forgotten. What a treasure it is! I definitely need to add it to my list of best friend books....</summary>
