    <summary>Although I don't make New Year's resolutions, inevitably one does think about priorities as the year winds down. One realization I've come to recently is that I need to finish off at least one of my long-term projects. Because my Aristotle book is the farthest along (I've been researching it for five years!), I'm recommitting to it in hopes of completing a first draft by the end of 2025. This means that I'll have to cut back on blogging, pair reading, public-domain publishing at the Monadnock Valley Press, catching up on news and long-form cultural analysis, etc. Instead, I'll be reviewing the book and article summaries I've created, improving the outline, drafting and honing the text, identifying chapter epigraphs, and so on. Where appropriate, I'll continue to use my weblog to work out my thinking on various Aristotelian themes; however, I might be posting less frequently on other topics....</summary>

    <summary>My publication activity at the Monadnock Valley Press waxes and wanes; 2022 was a busy year, 2023 was relatively quiet, and in 2024 I republished more works from the public domain than in any previous year since founding the site in 2008 (e.g., I published on 118 separate days this year, whereas the average in previous years was 18!). This time around the haul included:...</summary>

    <title>Value vs. Worth</title>

    <summary>In her book The Human Condition, Hannah Arendt argues that there is a subtle yet essential difference between value and worth: the concept of value is irreducibly social because it first emerged only within modern market economies where everything can be exchanged for everything else, whereas the worth of a person or artifact or living being is inherent within its own independent existence. Thus, according to Arendt, philosophers made a grave mistake when they imported the concept of value into politics, ethics, and aesthetics (the so-called "value branches" of philosophical inquiry). Consider, for instance, what happens when we speak of the relative value of the life of inquiry and contemplation vs. the life of social and political engagement vs. the life of making money vs. the life of pleasure and enjoyment. In modern times these wildly disparate ways of life are all on an equal footing of "value", which means we need to find a common standard of measurement for them. Just as in the market everything can and must be valued in terms of money, so now in ethics everything can and must be valued in terms of what the psychologists call subjective well-being, i.e., pleasurable feelings. As a result, the concept of value leads inexorably to a lowest-common-denominator utilitarianism. By contrast, the concept of worth helps us keep separate things that should be kept separate; as a result, we can come to understand that these ways of life are far from commensurable and that some of them are fundamentally better than others. Yet deliberating about worth takes more intellectual effort and moral courage (not to mention the fact that it can seem positively undemocratic), which could be why many people prefer to avoid it......</summary>

    <summary>My reading list contains hundreds of items. Indeed, I maintain multiple such lists, since some of them are dedicated to particular research topics or historical figures on which I plan to write books of my own, such as Pyrrho, Socrates, and Shakespeare. Periodically, however, I like to think about how I would cull my reading list down to absolute essentials if forced to do so. The general principle seems to be: which authors would I most want to interact with in future years, for the sake of learning, enjoyment, and contemplation?...</summary>

    <title>The Price of Wisdom</title>

    <summary>When Socrates was put on trial in Athens for corrupting the youth, part of his defense was that he never requested payment for attending to the concerns of other people and encouraging them to live a more virtuous, examined life; instead he came to people individually "like a father or elder brother" (Plato, Apology, 31b), acting out of care for their souls. In a little-noted passage in Nicomachean Ethics IX.1 (1164a33-b6), Aristotle seems to expand on this line of thinking. First he observes that in relationships founded on excellence of character - such as, say, the relationship of parent to child or elder sibling to younger sibling - the parties engage in good deeds toward each other and return favors through their own free choice and mutual commitment. Drawing an analogy between interpersonal love and the love of wisdom, he then says:...</summary>
