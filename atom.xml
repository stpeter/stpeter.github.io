    <summary>In my drive to hold fewer opinions (or at least hold them less strongly), for a while I tried to cultivate a healthy skepticism about things I believe - for instance, by attempting to question one opinion every week.

    <summary>If you ask those I work with or mentor what my distinctive personal qualities are, I suspect that on the short list you might find empathy. For instance, I often reach out to work colleagues if I know that they face significant challenges, if their skills aren't being fully utilized, if they're not appreciated as much as they should be, if someone on their team has resigned, or on the positive side if they've been doing great work....</summary>

    <summary>Although I don't make New Year's resolutions, at this time of year I do tend to reconsider some of my goals and practices. One thing I'd like to improve on is the frequency of entries in my online journal, because writing them pushes me to think about how I'm living and what I'm learning. Thus going forward I'll strive to post such reflections at least once a week - most likely on Friday evenings or over the weekend, when it's easier to find time for reflection.
