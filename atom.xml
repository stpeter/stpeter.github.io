    <summary>Twelve years ago when I was in Taipei for a weeklong standardization meeting, I snuck off one morning to visit the former home of Lin Yutang, where I bought a copy of his 1937 masterpiece The Importance of Living. Every few years I dip into this book, and each time I'm reminded of things I never should have forgotten. What a treasure it is! I definitely need to add it to my list of best friend books....</summary>

    <summary>The other day I glanced briefly at Ray Dalio's book Principles, which made something of a splash when it was published a few years ago. I decided not to read the book (for now) because I wasn't impressed by the few sections I looked at; in particular, he seems to reduce the art of living to two steps:...</summary>

    <summary>A few years ago when I needed to fly across the country to attend to some urgent family matters, I spotted an older woman at the airport wearing a button that said "I'm With Greta." The irony is that if she really were with Greta and believed, in the marrow of her bones, that human activity is causing a climate emergency, she wouldn't have been about to board an airplane, since jet travel is just about the worst thing you can do to generate greenhouse gases. In a similar vein, I've heard friends say how much they want to fly to Italy so that they can visit Venice before it is inundated by rising sea levels (caused in no small part by so many people flying to Italy so that they can visit Venice before it is inundated by rising sea levels). And don't get me started on the thousands of activists and bureaucrats who fly around the world to attend climate conferences....</summary>
