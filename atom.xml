    <summary>Not only do I read a lot, but I also re-read a lot.

Juster); plus I'm in the midst of re-reading The Importance of Living by Lin Yutang as well as the Tao Te Ching....</summary>

    <summary>Twelve years ago when I was in Taipei for a weeklong standardization meeting, I snuck off one morning to visit the former home of Lin Yutang, where I bought a copy of his 1937 masterpiece The Importance of Living. Every few years I dip into this book, and each time I'm reminded of things I never should have forgotten. What a treasure it is! I definitely need to add it to my list of best friend books....</summary>
