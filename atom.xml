    <summary>With all the Sturm und Drang about so-called artificial intelligence right now, I'd like to make it clear that I don't use these technologies. For me, the primary consideration is not that AI will, on balance, degrade humanity's already weakened ability to engage in independent thinking and humane interaction (although I think evidence is mounting that this will be the case).

    <summary>Over the last few months I've read three books by my favorite historian, David Hackett Fischer: Historians' Fallacies: Toward a Logic of Historical Thought (1970), Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America (my third reading of this book, published in 1989), and African Founders: How Enslaved People Expanded American Ideals (2022)....</summary>

Consistent with my own stance toward life, Gurri argued that ethics is not what you profess about national or global issues, but how you treat the people around you. Here's his summary:...</summary>
