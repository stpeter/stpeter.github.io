Is Achilles really the hero of the Iliad, or is it perhaps Hector (whose death and funeral mark the end of the poem)?

    <summary>In the most recent installment of our walk with Aristotle, we puzzled through the beginnings of his analysis of wisdom [phronēsis]. In Book VI.6-8 he climbs further up this steep section of the trail to discuss not only wisdom but also sagacity [sophia]....</summary>
