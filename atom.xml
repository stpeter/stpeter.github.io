    <summary>While I'm reflecting on philosophies and ways of life, I thought it would be interesting to look at what Aristotle says about ways of life in his writings on ethics....</summary>

    <summary>In his book What Is Ancient Philosophy?, Pierre Hadot almost singlehandedly resurrected the ancient conception of philosophy as a way of life. Consider this observation about the philosophical schools of Greece and Rome: "For us moderns, the notion of a philosophical school evokes only the idea of a doctrinal tendency or theoretical position. Things were very different in antiquity. No university obligations oriented the future philosopher toward a specific school; instead, the future philosopher came to attend classes in the school of his choice as a function of the way of life practiced there."...</summary>

    <summary>In my recent post on idealism and identity, I mentioned my attraction to the philosophy of personalism, with its emphasis on human dignity. It is perhaps a little-known fact that Martin Luther King, Jr., was greatly influenced by that very philosophy. Early in life he ventured north to study at Boston University, then the center of personalist thought in America, where he completed his doctorate under theologian Edgar Sheffield Brightman. We can see the deep influence of personalism on King's views in two quotes from his famous "I Have a Dream" speech:...</summary>

    <summary>Personal identity is a deep, and deeply meaningful, subject: at some level, what's more important than what makes you you? Paradoxically, throughout history and across cultures, often personal identity has been a social construct, tied closely to tribe, clan, family, ethnic group, race, caste, class, societal role, and so on - usually in opposition to some Other ("I'm a Capulet, not a Montague", "I'm a proletarian, not a bourgeois", etc.)....</summary>

    <summary>In my drive to hold fewer opinions (or at least hold them less strongly), for a while I tried to cultivate a healthy skepticism about things I believe - for instance, by attempting to question one opinion every week. This didn't work, at least for me, because it felt too negative. Instead, now I'm working to cultivate curiosity. Here are a few thoughts on the process....</summary>

    <summary>If you ask those I work with or mentor what my distinctive personal qualities are, I suspect that on the short list you might find empathy. For instance, I often reach out to work colleagues if I know that they face significant challenges, if their skills aren't being fully utilized, if they're not appreciated as much as they should be, if someone on their team has resigned, or on the positive side if they've been doing great work....</summary>
