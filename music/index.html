<h1>Peter Saint-Andre: Music</h1>
<p>I've been playing guitar and bass, singing songs, and writing music for a long time. The music I create comes in three varieties under numerous <a href='influences.html'>influences</a>: acoustic singer-songwriter fare, extended pieces for solo classical guitar with new-age overtones, and arrangements for solo <a href='bass.html'>electric bass</a>.</p>
<p>I'm currently working on four projects, focusing mostly on the first one for now:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/music/yes/">Fundamental Affirmation</a> &#151; arrangements for solo bass of songs by the progressive rock band Yes</li>
<li><a href="/music/aubade/">Aubade</a> &#151; three suites and a set of variations for solo classical guitar</li>
<li><a href="/music/plow/">Freedom's Plow</a> &#151; a musical setting of Langston Hughes's long poem about America and freedom</li>
<li><a href="/music/hagiography/">Hagiography</a> &#151; a suite of original songs about life and love</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually I hope to also work on solo bass recordings of music by <a href="/music/rush/">Rush</a>, <a href="/music/ellington/">Duke Ellington</a> and of <a href="/music/bach/">Bach's Cello Suites</a>, and to perhaps make a recording or two of <a href='covers.html'>covers</a>.</p>
