<h3>Music for Solo Guitar</h3>
<p>These extended works have their origins in my simple love for the guitar. Although I listen to piano music more than to guitar music (I like to say that I have "pianist envy"), I have always loved the feel and the sound of the guitar above all else. My primary influences for the three suites can be summarized as "ABC": <cite>Autumn</cite> by pianist George Winston, <cite>Breakfast in the Field</cite> by guitarist Michael Hedges, and <cite>Close to the Edge</cite> by progressive rock band Yes. To the variations can be added the influence of Bach, especially his <cite>Goldberg Variations</cite>. Although I have not yet recorded these pieces in any form, you can find sheet music below.</p>
