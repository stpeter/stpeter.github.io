<h3>Music for Solo Guitar</h3>
<p>These extended works have their origins in my simple love for the guitar. Although I listen to piano music more than I listen to guitar music (I like to say that I have "pianist envy"), I have always loved the feel and the sound of the guitar above all else. I wrote most of these pieces long ago, indeed I started noodling with some of these themes as far back as my teenage years. Although I have not yet recorded them in any form (and I plan to record my <a href='/music/yes/'>Yes transcriptions</a> first), you can find sheet music below.</p>
