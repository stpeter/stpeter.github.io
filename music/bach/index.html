<h2>Bach on Bass</h2>
<p>Bach's Cello Suites are amongst the most sublime music ever written.</p>
<p>Some years ago I formed the aspiration of playing them on <a href="/music/bass.html">electric bass</a>. Because Bach was notorious for a certain kind of instrumental agnosticism, there's nothing necessarily irreverent about an electric bass arrangement &#151; although it <em>would</em> be unorthodox. Yet I am interested in this project not for its shock value but for its musical value, since it would be a wonderful way to showcase the capabilities of the electric bass, and for me to understand from the inside the musical thinking of the greatest of all composers.</p>
<p>Although success is far from assured, I've started to slowly climb this mountain. Check out my <a href='journal.html'>Bach on Bass journal</a> for progress reports.</p>
