<h2>Topology</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>
Well some folks say love is chemistry<br />
And others say it's biology<br />
Magnetism, electricity<br />
But they don't know about you and me<br />
'Cause our love it ain't none of above<br />
No our love is topology
</p>
<p>
Electric currents, magnetic fields<br />
No they don't describe just how I feel<br />
Strong force, weak force, molecular bonds<br />
Pebbles making waves when they're thrown in ponds<br />
No we fit together like a hand in a glove<br />
'Cause ours is a topological love
</p>
<p>
Well every kind of loving has its up and down<br/>
Sometimes you're a hero and sometimes you're a clown<br/>
Some say action at a distance can be good enough<br/>
But I'd like something closer when the going gets rough<br/>
I'm thinking white on rice or maybe the ocean to the shore<br/>
The way we fit together I want more more more more more more
</p>
<p>
Well I don't mean to intellectualize<br />
Something as simple as proportionate size<br />
But oh baby I'm a-loving just your size and height<br />
You know you suit me so well that it sure feels right<br />
'Cause I fit you and you fit me<br />
And that's why it's topology
</p>
