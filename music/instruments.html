<h2>Peter Saint-Andre: Instruments</h2>
<p>I play four different instruments:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A beat up old jumbo Taylor six-string that I bought in New York City circa 1988 (model #815, serial #690), on which I play most of the <a href='/music/hagiography/'>songs</a> I've written, my musical setting of <a href='/music/plow/'>Freedom's Plow</a>, and various cover tunes such as songs by <a href='/music/dylan/'>Bob Dylan</a>.</li>
  <li>A Hirade classical guitar, on which I play my <a href='/music/aubade/'>suites and variations</a> for solo guitar.</li>
  <li>A four-string <a href='/journal/1454.html'>Minotaur</a> bass guitar built by <a href="http://www.veilletteguitars.com/">Joe Veillette</a>, on which I play my arrangements of <a href='/music/yes/'>Yes songs</a> for solo bass as well as the bass lines on some of my original songs.</li>
  <li>A completely custom five-string Symphony bass guitar (the <a href='/journal/1731.html'>Mocha 5</a>) created by <a href="https://stradi.pl/">Marek DÄ…bek</a> of Juliszew, Poland, on which I play my transcriptions of the <a href='/music/bach/'>Bach Cello Suites</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I use D'Addario strings on the first three: Phosphor Bronze light strings (EJ16) on the Taylor (which is in such a weakened state that it can't even handle my preferred medium light strings), Pro-Arte extra hard tension nylon strings (EJ44) on the Hirade, and medium-gauge nylon tapewound strings (ETB92) on the Minotaur. The Symphony bass sports custom strings from the Italian string maker Galli.</p>
