<h1>&#x13DA;&#x13A2;&#x13B5;&#x13CB;&#x13A2;&#x13CB;&#x13D2;</h1>
<p>I'm Peter Saint-Andre, a.k.a. <a href='/journal/731.html'>stpeter</a>.</p>
<p>Although I worked for 25+ years as a <a href='/tech/'>technologist</a>, I retired in 2022 and I'm now focused on philosophical writing and musical composition.</p>
<p>As a <a href='/writings/'>writer</a>, I've published half a dozen books, including encounters with <a href='/writings/nietzsche/'>Nietzsche</a>, <a href='/writings/thoreau/'>Thoreau</a>, <a href='/writings/epicurus/'>Epicurus</a>, and <a href='/writings/roark/'>Rand</a>. My next book will be an epitome of Aristotle's views on <a href='/writings/aristotle/'>human fulfillment</a>, followed by an <a href='/writings/pyrrho/'>epic poem</a> about Pyrrho, the founder of ancient Greek skepticism.</p>
<p>As a <a href='/music/'>musician</a>, I have composed and arranged numerous <a href='/music/hagiography/'>songs</a> for voice and guitar as well as extended pieces for <a href='/music/aubade/'>classical guitar</a> and <a href='/music/yes/'>electric bass</a>. I'm currently working on a transcription of the <a href='/music/bach/'>Bach Cello Suites</a> for solo bass guitar and also composing some short pieces for classical guitar inspired by Erik Satie.</p>
<p>My <a href='/journal/'>online journal</a> is updated regularly and is now also available as a Substack newsletter entitled <a href='https://beautifulwisdom.substack.com/'>Beautiful Wisdom</a>. Everything I work on is placed into the <a href='/writings/essays/publicdomain.html'>public domain</a> and available under <a href='https://github.com/stpeter'>source control</a>. I also republish judiciously selected public domain writings via the <a href='https://monadnock.net/'>Monadnock Valley Press</a>. Feel free to <a href='contact.html'>contact me</a> if you'd like to have a conversation.</p>
